 , Note that for this to make sense, the US would absolutely have to raise the comically low capital gains tax rate., and \""either don't raise it or absolish minimum wage entirely.\, To be honest its more of a wider reaching problem than that minimum wage is too low, all of our wage scale is a bit unhealthy, CEO pay is almost uncompetitively high, the added burden of under paid workers is an unnecessary stress on our social welfare programs, raises taxes for employers and workers while not improving living conditions, Average income has either stagnated or dropped in many fields and areas for almost three decades, and a magnitude of other less direct problems like the devaluation of a college and HS degree., And yet, it's now turning out to be cheaper to raise chickens in the US, Unless paying employees more money results in proportionally higher profits, there's no reason to raise wages.

  , Raising it to $9-10/hr still wouldn't be able to support a single mother with one or two children and you can't base a wage on those factors due to wage discrimination., Now they will make $50 versus $62.50, so it makes sense for them to raise prices.   , ""It doesn't, but if you raise the income of those burger flippers they have more buying power as consumers and are better for the economy.""
