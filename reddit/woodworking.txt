"If this is just going to be the top of a cabinet, it shouldn't be any more difficult than any of the checkered pattern cutting boards that you've probably seen on here in the past couple of weeks/months.  Overall, it would just be two different square faced rectangles of different color glued together with vices, then cut up into little rectangles and reassebled into the checker board.  Then just glue on the side edges.  I'd probably use wooden dowels into some pre-drilled holes pop on the lower edges onto the inlayed and outlined chess board. Then plane and sand it all smooth.\n\n\nThat's how I'd do it anyway, but I'm fairly new to woodworking as well."
"Did your mother wash it, and leave it on a flat surface with water underneath the board while the top dried?  This can lead to cracking even with that finish.  "
"I'd suggest doing splines sockets on the table saw, and try to find a flat-top saw blade to do so. Otherwise you'll have to fill the spots the spline won't fill. \n\nAnything sanded will not be consistent, no matter how hard you try. Cutting spline fills on the table saw is also easy to do with just a $15 digital caliper. Once you get the fence adjusted such that the spline fits the socket, cut at least a dozen for future use. Then cut another dozen out of different woods. :)"

"Real plywood (4x8 sheets) is made with gigantic hydraulic press/cooker things that simultaneously apply tons of force across the whole sheet to get a good bond, and cook it to cure the glue. Not exactly replicable at home.\n\nBut certainly you can laminate smaller amounts of whatever you like at home. Getting a good bond between the layers is what it's all about. If it was me, and for some reason the final design required me to actually fabricate a 4x8 sheet, I would glue it up one layer at a time, and literally cover the whole sheet with sand bags while the glue sets."

"As a teenager I worked in a summer camp woodshop.  Our boss had had the job for 20 years and taught high school art/shop during the year.  When we had little kids in, we did the cuts for them, explaining what we were doing and educating on safety.  One day, my boss is working on the table saw while we have a bunch of 8 year olds in.  He stops the cut part way through, calmly walks over to me, and says, \"I'm going to find an ambulance.  I need you to line the kids up and send them back early, then go look for my thumb.\"\n\nTurns out it was still attached by a flap of skin and they were able to reconnect.  I can only guess he was distracted by one of the kids, presumably engaging in some sort of misconduct. Not sure of the details, we always used pushblocks.\n\nA family friend lost a finger to chainsaw kickback, also a case of distraction.\n\nBoth my dad and maternal grandfather had permanently split thumbnails from missing with hammers, which is really a case of sloppy technique."

[William Ng's video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbG-n--LFgQ&amp;noredirect=1) will get you dead on accurate and the method is actually really simple. Mine is a base of 3/4\" mdf, which is kind of thick, 1/2 will do but I had the 3/4\" on hand. The back fence is 1 1/2 thick maple with a high spot over the blade area which curves nicely to the rest of the fence. When I put my hand on it I know I an not near the blade because I never go past the curve. Kinda like this  .__/----\\___ terrible I know.  \n\nAs far as stability, just make sure the wood has acclimated to the shop, rough mill, let it stand and re acclimate then finish mill. A thick piece of maple is very stable.\n\nEDIT: Also re-read your post, no jointer or access to one? That is kind of the key to the whole thing.

"&gt; EDIT: Also re-read your post, no jointer or access to one? That is kind of the key to the whole thing. I guess the difference is buying something already milled from the store, which will not be flat, and flattening it yourself. \n\nYah, which is why I was wondering about stuff that should, theoretically, be squared already, such as MDF.  I don't have access to a sawmill so anything that's not available at Home Depot or Lowes (Cedar, Oak, Poplar, or Pine) isn't an option.   Though theoretically the table saw should be able to joint something, but then I'm still left with the problem of what fence to base the jointing off of. "
"You could lay up 3 pieced of 3/4\" MDF. Would be stable and thick enough. That should be straight enough. \n\nRight about the table saw, you can assume your fence is straight, if it is not there are problems. But the real problem is, think of ripping not as jointing but as creating an edge parallel to the edge against the fence. Which means it will follow what ever curve or shape the edge against the fence has. "
"Well I was thinking if I made a jointing sled of sorts and secured the wood to it with screws or some such, then it should make the first face parallel to the miter slot rather than an arbitrary fence.  As far as I can tell, I've heeled my blade appropriately to the miter slot so that should be relatively parallel and give me a parallel edge.  Then with one face paralleled, I could then use the fence (which as far as I can tell is parallel to the blade) to joint the other edge.  "
"That would do it!\n\nI think the 3 pieces of MDF will make a really decent fence though. "
"Are you saying to cut strips, stack them, glue them, and then use that?  I was thinking of doing something similar to that and wondering if it'd work.  "
"Nice.  I really like the contrast.  Are the shelves dado'ed into the sides?  The face frame came out well.\n\nI am not sure how the doors were done from this pic but the tolerances look really tight - nice job."

"Yup. Laminating it will make it very rigid and MDF is pretty darn stable. \n\nJust don't store the sled on a concrete floor. Keep it up off the floor if you can. I left a sled I made at my dads house for a couple months on the floor leaning against the wall. All the MDF on the side touching the floor puffed up and the sled was all kind of out of square.  "

"Hi guys.  I am looking to make another one of these for my living room, http://www.dwr.com/product/sticotti-shelving-unit-a.do?sortby=ourPicks.  I have one in my office right now using a French Cleat, as pictured.  \n\nThe one I am making now, I am using 6/4 oak and it will be harder to use my jig saw to cut the cleat onto the vertical piece.  So I am thinking of doing what I painted in the 2nd picture.  Of course I will not leave it hanging off of the \"cleat,\" but I will screw it in there, as well as screw it into the studs going down the piece.  \n\nDo you think this will work for my shelf?  The vertical pieces are 6/4 and 4\" wide.  I will be using 3/4 ply as the shelf.  This is going to be a book shelf.\n\nThanks!"

"Thanks for the advice. I'll keep my eyes on them and inspect them periodically for stress marks. The ladders can be easily removed and upgraded if signs of wear/stress appear.

"Back in September while running a test piece through my table saw for a dado cut, I lost control of the board, which kicked back.

I yanked my finger out as quick as I could but was cut right down the middle of the topside of my finger, from the tip to midway between the first and second knuckle. \n\nIt cut the tendon and I had surgery to place a permanent hook in the bone behind the first knuckle to help hold the end of the tip of my finger level. I'm a lefty and when writing the pen falls across that area so it was important to get it back where I could hold one again. Total recovery time will be 9-12 months, so my shop time has been severely curtailed while it heals. \n\nIf you watch this video, you can see how quickly a kickback happens, it's eerily similar to what happened to me, though his was somewhat planned.

"Did you build Connect-4? Cause that's mighty genius. If not, then I have no idea what that is."
"Yes! It's connect-4.  More specifically, it's Vier Gewinnt.  I purchased a German connect-4 game as a gift about 22 years ago from a toy store in Beuren, Germany (just imagine the two dots above the u and strike the e if you're German).\n\nFor 22 years (or there-abouts) I've been trying to figure out how to reproduce that game.  Yesterday morning, I woke up with the knowledge.\n\nSo, I cut 1\"x1\" strips of wood.  Then, I put a 1/2\" bit in the router table that would fit a 1/2\" dowel and centered the fence.  I ran the wood strips down the router, flipped them over and did it again.\n\nThen, I put a round-over bit in the router and rounded the edges.\n\nCut the pieces into 1\" 'cubes' and started sanding.\n\nAs you can see in the photos, I used my scrap to test-fit the router bits and the drill holes and such and like.\n\nMy problems with this stem from the dark pieces being about 1mm larger than the light pieces.  If I were a smart man, I would have shaved the .5mm off both sides.\n\nInstead, I spaced the pegs a little further apart.  Now, the dark pieces catch on each other occasionally.  If I am ever playing as 'light', I will simply blame whoever is dark for failing to place their piece.  Next time I build this, I'll make sure to get the sizes perfect.\n\nBeyond that, yes.

Carve out the design using files, jig saw, spindle sander (good tool to own for these types of projects), what ever you have will work. Just try to get it as close to the original as possible, because knowing spyderco and benchmade, they will have done the best job at designing the handle to fit the blade. But, like you most likely, I prefer the feel of wood compared to rubbery stuff. If those are knives you're planing on buying I know benchmade has knives with wood handles and you could save your self a lot of work."

"Traditional French cleats are intended to run the whole length (or at least, most of the whole length) of a piece, and to have contact with the wall cleat the whole way from a matching, inverse cleat mounted on the piece. That way, the load is distributed over a large area.\n\nThe way you've got this, the entire load of the shelf plus its contents (books are heavy), is riding on relatively small sections of wood. And the way the cleat is oriented relative to the grain, the cleat on the wall is eventually going to rip that little hook of wood on the vertical shelf pieces right off. The way the forces are going, you're essentially splitting the wood *along* the grain. That's the direction the wood *most* wants to split in. So, good on ya for using 6/4 stock, but I don't think I'd trust that with a full load of books.\n\nThe good news is that when it falls down, the cleat will still be hanging proudly on the wall so you can hang a better-designed support on that..."

"| I have tried sharpening it on **a** sharpening stone but I feel like it hasn't done much\n\nThat, right there, may be your problem. You need multiple stones... low grit to grind bevel followed by progressively higher grit until you get a nice polished bevel. I'm a big fan of DMT-style plates (rough, medium, fine, extra fine) followed by a bench strop loaded with green rouge. I do sharpen free-hand, but you can use a sharpening guide/jig if you want.\n\nThe higher polish you have on the bevel, the cleaner your worked surface will be. The shaving thinness is also related to the polish level, as rougher bevels would make dust or shreds instead of shavings. After the green rouge, I'm able to take gossamer thin shavings and leave mirror surfaces on fir.\n"

"I have the Mk. II and while it's probably the best jig on the market at the moment I do have a few issues with it. I sometime find it hard to get the blade perfectly square in the jig because it doesn't offer much sideways support. Not a huge issue but it's a bit annoying. I also can't get my mortice chisels in the jig because they're too thick. From what I understand both Veritas and LN's new guides are going to be side clamping which will solve the issue of the sideways movement in the Mk. II. I also know that the LN will have attachments to allow you to sharpen different types of thing such as thick mortice chisels.\n\nThere's no set dates on the new jigs, both companies have just said early 2014.

"Wood glue will not adhere to varnish or wax, so usually finishing is done at the end. \n\nIf you have scraps, use those to determine how a finish will look before you apply it to the entire project. Those are especially useful for determining how stains will look. \n\nSatin finishes will leave a non-shiny result and be protective. Generally the first coat will soak in and leave a dull finish too. \n\nIf it's smooth to 180, unpolished wax shouldn't stay shiny either. (Too rough a surface and you may leave globs of wax behind.)

"I haven't spent much I buy my planes at garage sales. I've found a couple of #5s ($10-15), a #4 ($10), a little block plane ($2). I even found a [#78] (http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1162/748695385_c180ef2e7a.jpg?v=0), which I bought for its weirdness--I haven't used it yet ($20). I found a #7 jointer for $60 at auction.\n\nFor sharpening, I used to have a hand-me-down stone from my father, but it was pretty badly worn and uneven. So, I bought a new one for $20 or so. I also picked up a few pieces of mirror from a garage sale (pretty much free) and put some sandpaper down on them (600, 1200 and 2000 grit, I think). That does me just fine. It gets the planes (and my chisels) super sharp. \n\nI quite enjoy just sitting down in front of the soccer game and sharpening up everything.\n\nI've bought almost all my tools used (craigslist, kijiji, garage sales, etc.), and they don't cost much. It takes a bit of time to run around and find what you're looking for, but I find it enjoyable. You never know what you'll find. I found a jointer (machine, not plane) for $70, a couple of cordless drills for $5 each (and I refurbished the batteries).\n\nThe expensive thing, I find, is the wood. Now, I just need to find a nearby place to reclaim lumber."

"Yeah, anything over 108 square feet needed a permit. So the ship, pergola and deck all needed a construction permit. As they were all one one site 1 permit for all of them was enough though. During the permit process I learned things need to be at least 3 feet from the property line. The pergola is considered a structure, so I had to move the entire patio over 6\" or 8\" over towards the house once it was built.\n\nIt took a pretty complicated site plan including water flow patterns and measurements from every structure to the property line and to other structures. With metric measurements shown. It was a real pain in the butt. \n\nFortunately I took drafting in grade 10 and had some small notion what I was doing. The permit I filed for this was the same one you file if you want to build a Walmart. So I can see why a lot of people don't bother.\n\nI documented the foundation repairs quite closely. When I sold the house I opted to reveal everything I had done to potential buyers. I even had a photo album of what was wrong and what I did to fix it. I did a proper job fixing a lot of things and it cost me a lot of money. I needed to sell my house in a reasonably short time frame, but I didn't want to loose too much money. So I had to list close to the price I wanted and not bargain down a lot. It worked out pretty well I sold for just a couple grand under asking in less than 2 weeks. I attribute getting the price I wanted to showing that there were problems but they were fixed properly and the house had good bones."

"Ha! I had to go back into my history and see what you were talking about.\n\nFirst of all - you're right - I have been working with wood for longer than a year. But I have only done two projects previous to this - the first, and oldest, was spending days trying to figure out dimensions for a basic butt-joint box, having only automotive tools to my name, going to the hardware store and making them cut all of my plywood to the finished size, and going home and screwing them all together with butt joints. This was for a couple tropical snake enclosures that are an absolute eyesore. I used stain like paint - i must have applied 4 or 5 coats of it. I knew *nothing.*\n\nThe second project was after reading /r/woodworking and online resources for months, where I built 3 more enclosures that people even paid money for. I had better tools, I used miter joints, I stained and finished them properly. I'll try and get you some pictures that compare the two \"generations\" - it is astonishing.\n\nNow what we have here, is what I consider my first \"fine\" woodworking projects - something beyond slapping 6 pieces of plywood and a coat of stain together. \n\nEither way - you're right, time flies. It hasn't felt like a year. Oh, speaking of which! Happy New Year!"

The top is rusted to shit, so there's a good chance it wasn't maintained worth a damn, and I wouldn't be surprised if the motor and/or belt have been ridden hard.\n* Doesn't have modern safety features like a riving knife, which, again, would affect my price I'd be interested in paying\n\nA quick search in the Craigslist in your area and I'd be much more likely to buy [this](http://lasvegas.craigslist.org/tls/4255618864.html) saw, but I'd see if I could get them to take $475 before I went to look at the saw."

"Very nice job. I've made plane totes before and I found that it was best to put off finishing them until I'd used them for a while, so I could still make adjustments to the shaping. Downside is they get grubby in the process and have to be sanded down again before finishing.  \nThe finger grooves are pretty cool too."
"I assume the case is also pocket hope joinery also? \n\nCan you post a closer photo of the feet? Curious how those are put together. Are they part of the carcass or a decorative add-on during install. \n\nI see you did a base frame and installed over that. Where are the attachment points inside of the cabinet? "
"Spidey sense is tingling.  Same suspicions as others have already noted."
"The original tote was broken in half so it needed to be replaced. I was going to go for natural Rosewood but I love the way the Bocote looks when you finish it up and it's such a rigid wood. Oddly enough, they are both cut from the same blank which makes the color difference somewhat odd. "
"The old rockwells are great, The only thing wrong with them was there fence, but a new delta unisaw fence should go on, which makes it a very good saw. I say good deal"
"That is a really superb piece of work."
"Small world, I grew up on the Bayou Teche. "
"You already get those on etsy, think they are made from bamboo"
"Gotcha.  The bocote definitely looks badass.  A very distinctive wood.  Good call on that pick."
"This looks somewhat similar to the Aurora Table.  Did you go off of that or come up with this yourself?\n\nLooks great!  A Greene and Greene piece is on my short list of things to do."

"Nice! What do you think of the gripper - I was thinking about getting one or making something similar."
"Thanks for the kind words. I made the finger grooves because I have sausage fingers :) Plus, the way my hands grip all plane totes leaves my pinky finger hanging over the side so I made the grip a little thicker than normal to make that more comfortable. "
"Another vote for woodcraft.com. They have a great selection of small boards in many different species."
"What is under all those clamps?"
"You're mind me of me, \"might as well buy the best since I've got 40 more years of doing this.\""
"Could be a freezer / refrigerator drawer. I have one just like that separate from my fridge unit. "
"Incra stainless steel rulers, protractors and marking aids. Really well made and precise."

"The saw is decent, the blades would be suitable for rough work. I'm not a fan of skeleton extension wings - something always snags in there. Those tube fence rails are a little flexible, compared to the modern square tubes on the Bies type fences. This saw is preferable to the usual Craftsman 10\" for $120."
"Damn fine work"
"I use a couple big C clamps and have not had any issues with it moving. "
"It was a Christmas gift, and I love it. It takes a little more setting up than a regular push stick or similar, but it's fairly straight forward and worth the peace of mind that my fingers will stay on my person. "
"I'm not really sure about the price tag, but both are good saws. The delta I think has a 1 hp engine though. I don't think you could go wrong with either, but you might check around and see if you could find the delta for cheaper. There are so many of them around its ridiculous"
"Assuming they both work well they're both pretty similar in terms of function and either would be pretty good. The only concern I would have is that I'm fairly sure jet don't make 12\" bandsaws any more which might mean you will have trouble getting the right size blades or parts. I know you can get riser blocks for the delta but I'm not sure about the jet. You might want to look into that incase you decide you need more resaw capacity. \n\nEDIT: Never mind about blade for the jet. I though they used an odd size but they're 82\" which isn't hard to find. "
"My take is a bit different. I agree that most low end machines are equivalent - my sub $125 drill press is a Ryobi that I've had for a few years. To me, it's far more important that I get accurate work out of the machine than that it has lots of power. \n\nI would really recommend an extension table with a fence.  I bought an inexpensive model from harbor freight for $35 that increased my work surface to nearly 12x24\".  I've been really pleased with the combination, which fits in my small garage workshop."
"it's really funny you should mention that - I was looking at more bandsaw boxes yesterday and it totally occured to me that I didn't round over the edges. Really brings it to a new level doesn't it?"

"I used an article in fine woodworking by Darrell Peart but deviated fairly quickly.  So, no plans."
"Yes!  This is based on the Aurora table by Darrell Peart but with much cruder methods and standards...."
"That is truly amazing work."
"Starret ain't no slouch either. I love my Starret 12\" combination square. I'll have to check out the Incra offerings as well..."
"For the price (~$120) I'm pretty well satisfied with the Ryobi benchtop drill press I picked up at Home Depot. It doesn't have a great table, but the chucks and drive system is nice and steady. Makes clean, crisp holes, anyway."
"I grew up in an arts and crafts home. I have so much love for this style of furniture. This piece is beautiful, and it made me feel warm and fuzzy."
"Glue up fail. Not sure what happened, but the joints were so weak they broke falling off the table saw. These pieces *should* be 5 alternating kinds of wood. "
"When being plum and level matters, and transit or laser are not practical. My go to hand level is \"Crick\". Well made and a good weight to it."
"Ouch....!"
"very nice! I'm jealous"
"Would you be able to post a picture of your drill set up?"
"Thanks bud, I appreciate it."
"Starrett combo square. Or anything they make, really. "
"Maybe I'm missing something, but why were they falling off your table saw?"
"Incra and Starrett are really good. Don't sleep on Woodpeckers for rules, top quality and made in the USA"

"I don't have a closer pic of the feet, however, they are part of the face frame and just go to the floor and frame the toe kick area. think of a standard kitchen cabinet with some feet added on. \nThe Base cabs are all just tied together with screws and to the wall with bigger screws via a nailer strip that runs along the back of the cab behind the back panel."
"It wasnt nailed on yet. I just remembered to take a picture at that point and did, because I forget to so often."
"wasn't nailed on yet, just piecing it together at that point."
"Is there a name for that style of plug?"
"That's what I am trying to visualize.. are the ft part of the face frame or the side panel. Not having much luck in books and online. I see lots of people showing the final result but the not the process:)\n\nAll the books are from 1980 when raised panel oak cabinets made from particle board were hot. \n"
"I can't believe I'm saying this, but I got this all in Canada at a relatively large chain called Windsor Plywood. (i sound shocked because, well, normally Canada is a black hole for a lot of consumer products) Their prices aren't the best and I'm not good enough at picking through wood to find all the \"best figured\" pieces but it's close to home and it's just fun shopping for lumber."
"They are both. Imagine not notching out the side panels for the toe kick and the face frame continuing to the floor at the same time."
"And miter gauges. "
"If you're going to make a number of frames you should first build a jig. e.g.  http://www.woodmagazine.com/woodworking-plans/jigs/adjustable-picture-frame-jig/ there are numerous other examples easily available on the www. \nAfter the the glue on your new frame is set up you can dress up the corners with a spline for long term strength. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH_o3aMSsBI \n\n"

"What are the prices like?  I know Starrett is insanely expensive.  Like $20 for a 6\" rule.  "
"Dat mortising."
"Gravity. "
"Scrap!"
"Yes"
"I'd go with the Delta all the way. Having the power available for resawing, and the availability of accessories would tip it.  FWIW, I have the jet 14\" and love it. "

"I'm curious what you used to make such a solid looking table top.  "
"Yes, ebay.  I just made a blank to hold my sharpening stone ([idea from Paul Sellers](http://paulsellers.com/2013/04/making-my-sharpening-plate-holder/)).  I didn't take any pics during the process but I will get ya some shots of the router in action, no upvote required, this thing should be shared with the world. Now that I have it, I don't know how I lived without it."
"You should check if the glue is very old or if it was outside the recommended temperature range at any point. I had a bottle of Titebond III that went below 5 degrees C one winter and it almost cost me a few projects"
"it only had a 1/4\".  I wasn't expecting an iron with it, so I had already ordered the [1/2\" blade from Lee Valley](http://www.leevalley.com/US/wood/page.aspx?p=67484&amp;cat=1,41182,43698,67484).  The 1/4\" appears to be original as it  matches the wear or the plane"

"It is very rare to see used Festool. Two reasons, the general public doesn't know they exist because you can't find them in big box stores and those that have em don't / won't sell them. \nOlder ones are Festoo. Once you use one you will buy nothing else. The engineering, materials and quality are second to none. If on the off chance you need to service you will find no other company that stands behind their product lik try do"
"Oh ok, so by accident. I thought they fell on outfeed, then I would spare no pity for you. "
"Bottles less than 6 months old and the garage, while not heated, is the basement of our house and doesn't get below 50-ish F.\n"
"So the picture is actually a combination of things.  The first few actually came apart on saw up.  I could see it happening and just let them fall to the ground.\n\nThose that didn't come apart on sawing I put into a pile.  After hand testing a couple some snapped with almost no effort.  Those I forcefully threw to the ground.\n\nthe remainder ended up on the ground when I realized that more than half were now broken apart at which point I pushed the entire pile on to the floor, stomped on it a few times for good measure, and then went to refill my coffee cup."
"Very expensive firewood. "
"I have found Oak, pine, maple, and redwood at the Lowes near me but I don't know if each Lowes carries the same thing.  However, it would be better to get it at a store who actually knows and understands wood and wood handling."
"Looks like ... pine/fir??  Tough to get a nice looking stain finish on pine (for my likings anyway) \n\nI would consider multiple layers of different colored paint then sand through some of the layers to expose the raw wood for a distressed look. \nLatex paint isn't a good idea but anything from a rattle can (Krylon etc.) works well and sands easily. My choice though would be milk paint.  "
"Its awesome, it caught my bc my wife loves penguins."
"Link to the article?"
"Well then.  I spare no pity, but I have plenty of sympathy for you."
"I second the milk paint idea.  \n\nYou could also try oiling the shelves and see how they look.  the 2x2 almost looks like it is pressure treated, which would be tough to finish.\n\nI LOVE the fact that it is three-legged!\n"
"There are never enough clamps."
"Or David in South Haven?"
"The shelves themselves are pine. I tried some stain on a scrap piece and it ended up looking like a zebra, so I will have to try some of your ideas, thank you!"
"Thanks! I was going for an interesting design and that's what I came up with for the wood I had available. I will try out some danish oil on some scraps and see how it turns out."
"Starrett is the business, no doubt. I have their 12\" combination set also - there is nothing better. Their center-punches, scribes etc. are all top-notch, at a price. But they will never let you down.\n\nThe Incra stuff is specialized and is excellent for particular applications. Starrett is aimed at the machinist but any woodworker would find many uses for their tools."
