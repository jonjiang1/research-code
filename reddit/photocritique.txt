"It was taken with a Canon EF-S 17-55mm f/2.8 IS USM "
"I had the same general feeling. I'd like to see some negative space on the right in contrast to the white smoke."
"Canon EOS 1000D\n\nF/8\n\n1/60 sec.\n\nISO 400\n\n44mm\n\nFlash"
"What's the subject here?  I see a wall, a pavement, a person with no head, a telephone switching cabinet and a load of leaves.  Sorry to be so negative - but what is the subject here - and what do you think makes this an interesting picture?"
"Under exposed. Check your histogram. Why f8? Open up to f4 and let some of that flash in. "
"Do you have the color version? I think some processing in color could yield some nice color contrast since the grayscale is lacking in contrast."
"If you're interested, Numberphile made a [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOClr_bew38) highlighting the use of 10:10 in watch advertisements (though they don't speculate as to the reasoning)."
"Kudos for exposing correctly. Not like all these other f7.1 iso500 1/5000 pictures. The lighting is a little hard for my liking but that's just me. The blue/yellow works too."
"The only thing I can see that's in focus are branches at either edge of the photo.   What's with that lipstick??"
"Not much.  I really like this photo.   Possibly try to get it more level with is eyes.  I assume that was shot in a pool and you were above the surface of the water. "
"You are right. It was shot from the side of the pool. I never thought about getting level with the eyes. That is a great suggestion, thanks!\n\n"
"It's not focused where it should be (eyes, at a minimum) and it's very soft with little contrast. What are the specs? ISO/Aperture/Shutter Speed?  \n\nIf you were going for a soft, dreamy look there is potential here, but it's not quite there yet - especially with some of the branches being far sharper than the subject."
"Is DSLR photography inherently different than other kinds of photography?"
"good stuff. Great lighting but the composition kinda suffers for how much of a black space there is on the left. Would have loved to see some detail there as well, some smoke trails there would have made the shot much better. "
"I really like the geometry of the overpass, and I think that's the strongest part of the image. So, personally, the water distracts from that, and I'd crop up from the bottom of the pillars. Plus, though the picture looks level, my eyes follow the the side of the waterway towards the right (was it taken at an angle?).\n\nAs for the technical side, I think the detail could be improved by finding a more stable platform for the camera; there are some faint trails, possibly stars, in the sky that are a bit wobbly.\n\nThat being said, it's a good shot with plenty of potential. Well done on spotting the location too. "
"Love the colors! "
"Thanks"
"Lost me with the lipstick"
"If you let the exposure run for a long enough time you'll get a pretty clear reflection in the water underneath"
"It's a good photo, but it seems staged. No one smokes like that. I've also heard of photographers who refuse to photograph people who are smoking because they worry that it glamorizes it (which may or may not be true), and I sort of agree, so I have a biased opinion. "
"It's very snapshotty.  \n\nI mean that in the sense that it looks like a scene that you saw, walked up to, and took a shot of, instead of something a little more meaningful.  The background is distracting, the framing is boring, and you can't see enough of the subject's expression or what he's painting/drawing/whatever to really get a grip on what's going on.\n\nThe first thing I always suggest to people is to get lower.  Shoot from a perspective that isn't expected.  Maybe (if it was possible) shoot from low and behind the artwork looking up into the guy's face.  Maybe shoot over the shoulder.  Show me something I probably wouldn't have seen just by standing near the guy.  Maybe do a shot of just the hand. Give me more interest by using a narrow DOF to draw attention to something specific.  Something  interesting."

"I like it.  Good texture with an obvious focal point.\n\nSuggestions:\nPerhaps boost the highlights a bit?  The image looks like it doesn't have a lot of dynamic range, specifically in the upper part of the histogram.  \n\nPerhaps move the bird to something like the bottom left third?  I don't know if this is SOOC or if you cropped it down, but more pattern + more interesting positioning (other than dead center) might help it be more interesting.\n\n"
"I'm looking for some criticism of any apparent weaknesses that might be prevalent in the pictures. A lot of them are quick snaps because of the street shooting but do I need to get in closer or change the way I'm shooting ? Any advice is welcome really!"
"I agree the makeup doesn't blend enough with the scenery it becomes some weird focal point with nowhere for the eyes to go from there."
"Needs better lighting and possibly some kind of emotion from the subject.\nFocus on the eyes and like klamsykrawl said open the fstop up to 4 on the eyes of the subject. Back light, Rembrandt light any kind of lighting technique would make this more interesting. Also if its for Cosplay why not a 3/4 portrait so we can see its not just a bored dude with blue hair. "
"What settings did you shoot this at?  There's no EXIF info."
"The first thing it reminds me of are X-rays.  Usually when I see a bunch of bamboo it's more of a serene setting, but the (I'm guessing) B&amp;W conversion and/or high clarity makes it super contrasty and hard on the eyes.  \n\nI'd like to see your attempt at a color version of this.  Because it's definitely good texture and framing, but I don't know if the B&amp;W helps or hurts it."
"Panama City actually."
"Thank you for all of these very specific tips. I chose a photo of something I go back to a lot, so I can try to actually apply these ideas. One question: why is the longer exposure potentially making the water a focal point?"
"Use a larger DoF to gain some additional edge to edge sharpness. It seems to be vignetting fairly dramatically on the edges, was that intentional? or a byproduct of the lens that wasn't corrected?"
"Because if you look at the shot right now, you can see bits of the light reflecting in the water. With song exposure you'd really bring that out and it'd be a bigger focal point. Right now it's list water because the shutter speed didn't let you capture the reflections enough to be a big deal. The on get you leave the shutter open the more the water becomes a focal point, but the more you'll blow the highlights of the light sources, so he careful. It's a balancing act. "
"I did crop it just a bit because I wanted there to be a circle of holes around the bird itself. I did also shot it it with a rule of thirds, but it didn't look as nice as it does in the center surrounded  by the holes. But will definitely boost some highlights, I just noticed there isn't any white, just light gray"
"I agree that the framing seems off. If the face was to the left it would draw the eye into the photo and then the smoke would keep it moving. As is, you start on the right follow the smoke to the top and then... nothing."
"Others have commented on the horizon (easy fix) and the light trails from the planes (also a pretty easy fix).  Some additional things:\n\n- I would definitely start shooting in RAW.  Buy Lightroom and you can easily export those RAW files to JPEG.  You may not *need* RAW now, but I guarantee you'll realize too late you should have switched to it, so I say start in RAW.  That's just my opinion.\n\n- Try using a higher ISO setting so that you can get a shorter exposure.  I think some of the lack of sharpness is from camera vibration rather than from being out of focus.  If you can shorten your exposure time you'll likely reduce the effect of the vibrations.  If you like using a lower ISO (as you did in this shot) to reduce the noise, try moving your tripod lower to the ground by lowering its legs.  On shorter legs the tripod should be more sturdy AND by getting low you will also possibly eliminate some of the vibrations from the wind.  Even though I now own a super-steady tripod, on breezy days I will sometimes use my jacket to shield the camera from little gusts.\n\n- But the most important thing is to keep at it.  You got a really nice initial result (I would have killed for a shot like this as an early hobbyist), so go back, experiment with different settings and have fun with it.  If you stick with Flickr you'll find that there are lots of folks there willing to help you learn.\n\n- Did I mention shooting in RAW? :)\n\n"
"One thing I realized in this set of pictures was that I was prone to shooting in too large an aperture, creating a small DoF.  For some things that's great, but looking back I need to be much more mindful about that\n\nAs for the vignette, I just moved to FF and am not used to seeing it, as I am coming from APS-C with the same lenses (in this case, pancake 40mm).  I corrected it and didn't like it as much to be honest, so I kept it like this - quite possibly because I'm not used to seeing it so it's more \"new\" to me.  I've been correcting it on other shots though\n\nThanks for the feedback :) The more pictures I take, the more I see the bad habits I need to break"
"No. You can shoot with anything. A DSLR does give you more control over the image though and it's often seen as an upgrade from phones or point and click cameras. "

"Thanks I've been going through the manual slowly. Its pretty intimidating but I'm making progress and playing around with things. I also got a Beginners Guide to Photography for a few bucks at Barnes and Noble. I've been working on taking pictures in the different modes and I've had varying degrees of success but I do think I'm getting slightly better. "
"I'll definitely look into cropping pictures some. I've done a little photo editing but I'm just trying to get my picture better in general."
"WAY too blown out. "
"Well actually it was a snapshot.  I walked up to the guy, took a quick shot, and then proceeded to ask him about his work.  It wasn't posed nor did I really have much time to think about it.\n\nBut I will make it more interesting next time.  Thank you for your thoughts."
"Maybe down a stop, seems blown out a bit."
"I really like this for the feel of the landscape, but the sun flare kind of throws me off. Skyline seems to draw my attention more than the rest of the photo."

"No shit? In totally wasn't aware of that /s."
"Not sure I like the stark contrast'y look. I like shades of grays not straight B&amp;W. Also seems a bit too sharp. Otherwise the crop seems ok."
"True, each their own styles. Sometimes ones pref is not another's."
"[deleted]"
"Rule of thirds is just a suggestion, not an absolute. I try to think of it differently. Rule of thirds works well because you have your subject and then room for context. The rest of the space is used to put your subject into perspective. However, that's not the only way to frame a photo to be interesting. You can explore patterns, symmetry, shapes, and any other ways of laying out an image. \n\nThis image works well because you have an interesting pattern and a bird that provides really good contrast. I don't think there is any other way to do this without centering the bird. You want the eyes drawn straight to the center and have the pattern along the periphery of the viewer's vision. Put it anywhere else and it will be odd. On the left a person would see a bird and wonder why it is followed by a lot of brick. On the right a person would wonder why the bird is an afterthought to brick. (Assuming you read left to right of course)."
"Shoot RAW for long exposures or go home.\n\nAlso, no reason to stop down to f/16 unless you really care about the time lapse look. Your sharpness is suffering from diffraction and your unnecessarily long exposure time is adding noise."

"I don't think I've seen very many laser sunset pictures so I'm immediately drawn to this because of that.\n\n\nI agree the orange lens flare by the sun and the green speck lower left are probably the things that my eye wants to look at the most because of the color contrast, when I want my eyes to look at the laser.  Also maybe that blurry piece of grass in the foreground is a bit distracting too.  \n\nIt's neat to think about the depth of that ray--it's flight, but cutting through space...or maybe I don't understand what's going on, but it's fun to think that's what's happening at least.\n\nGreat photo!"
"You asked, I just assumed you were new to photography and cameras."
"I think the little man coming out of his head is perturbing him :/"
"Honestly OP, what do you like about this picture? Because I can't see anything I do..."
"WTF is up with that lens flare? I have never seen that before. Is that photoshop? If not, what lens?"
"Beautiful photo and I love how the eyes are so clear--were you able to get that sharpness in camera or in post?\n\nI'm not sure if it's intentional, but he looks decapitated to me.  If that is the point, sorry to be slow on the uptake and his expression makes for a pretty arresting image.  "
"Agreeing on the this.\n\nThere isn't any contrast, also, no interesting subject matter."
"Is everyone on here drunk tonight? Why does this have 30 up votes? This is a snap shot at best. It has no subject, its crooked, the plane is distracting, and so on and so on."
"The contrast is overdone, you've lost a lot of fascinating detail in the shadows that is now sorely missed."
"I really love this actually, it's a wonderful understated texture and the vignette is appealing to me."
"I think the difference here is that the whites are blown out to the point where it's difficult to look at. "
"Looks like you shot at like 6400 ISO. haha. Don't do that. Ever."
"[deleted]"
"seems kind of boring also just wondering if you took this on automatic?\n\nits a tight headshot would be nice to see the full body or at least more of the subject instead of just the head\n\nalso using a flash from an angle to light part of the face instead of front on would make the image much more interesting \n\nand possibly open the aperture up and blow out the background to create a bokeh effect would also help in shooting in low light conditions also think about the framing and angle you take the shot at things like shooting from the ground looking up could make it more interesting also"
"The camera I used was a Canon 600D, with a stock 18-55mm zoom lens."
"Yeah I can barely see any detail on the subjects face. Sure it might be there, but at a glance I just see glasses and a couple wrinkles. "

"It's too noisy. You need to use a bit of noise reduction in Lightroom/Photoshop/whatever you use."
"There is no reason for this image to be over-exposed. Artistic or no. Also, this old dude just looks confound to why you're randomly taking his picture."
"I don't think it's that bad, but I would've taken it from an angle that showed more of the rake. And it's very obvious that you clipped the snow and then tried to bring it in post — since it looks bad either way, the only way to salvage it is to probably retake it."
"Interestingly I hardly did anything to this image. I was shooting directing into the sun, and that's just the way the exposure turned out. I was using aperture priority and was 1 stop over exposed, because I'm into it! The only thing I changed was white balance and brought the exposure down some. What do you mean by saying that I clipped the snow then tried to being it in post?"
"Was the little triangle at the top right corner of the histogram white before you edited the exposure?"
"This is how you expose! What a fantastic shot! Kudos to you. I feel like too many people would have over-exposed this same image. The only flaw I can see is your shutter was a little slow. Although the motion blur works because it shows movement!"
"It is infact a plane. This is the RAW image. Once I get this into photoshop I was gonna remove it.\n\nThanks for the reminder!"
"WOW! I like it. Thanks you so much. I should really start tinkering with my photos a little."
"That means a lot, thank you! You are correct though, I had 7 different shots, but this was the only \"clean\" looking one I had. This was my first attempt at long exposure landscape photography and I'm happy people think Im going in the right direction :D"

"great shot! but imo selective color is kinda tacky... "
"Try without...."
"Let's just stop with the selective B&amp;W....."
"You definitely are, keep working on it and I'm certain you'll start producing some real quality stuff in no time. Happy New Years!"
"Much better in color in my opinion. The black and white looks are just too busy, your eye isn't drawn anywhere. The color version has a contrast of its own in the flowing creek and the lush vegetation in the background. \n\n"
"Absolutely, good images can be made incredible by even the slightest and modest of adjustments. The adjustments I made for you were very simple white balance/colour and contrast corrections, a very slight saturation boost, and then noise reduction and sharpening.\n\n If you don't use it yet, I'd suggest grabbing an Adobe Creative Cloud membership. The Photoshop Photography Program membership gives you the latest version of Photoshop, Lightroom, and Bridge for only $10/month *and* 20GB of Adobe Cloud storage and a Behance ProSite (for the sake of transparency I've never heard of Behance so I have no clue how you benefit from it... but it's free, so there's that). "
"I seldom use it, as I've grown rather tired of the effect myself, too. But this photo just *begged* for a selective colour treatment.\n\n**EDIT:** I am sincerely curious, though. Why do *you* think using selective colour is bad? And also, why is it bad in *this picture* according to *you*?"
"Thanks!!! And Happy New Years to you too :D"
"What is this supposed to be a picture of?"
"Front element not clean maybe?"
"Overexposed, not too interested subject, strange framing lines. "
"Dont use facebook to link it OP. Ever."

"Why did you choose to process it in grayscale? Color would help the bird stand out from the bricks, unless you're trying to make it blend in."
"The color version is a lot better."
"I love it.  Cool 'magic hour' photo.  Lens flares are awesome, in my opinion.  They add a bit of drama to a photograph.  I like how the light plays a huge roll as you can see the setting sun reflecting off everything in the foreground."

"I prefer the all black and white version.\n\nDid you sharpen the image a lot?  Maybe I just don't remember what the bokeh on the Canon 50mm f/1.8 looks like, but something about it seems a little harsh and angular.\n\nOther than that, it's ok.  I like how the jacket turned out in the all b/w version."

"Excellent!"
"It is a boring and overused effect that exists mainly to draw attention to a part of the image that the photographer failed to effectively accentuate by using DoF, leading lines, and general composition. It says \"I failed to make a quality photo using my skill-set so I resorted to a trite effect to do my job for me\"."
"It's got a really nice moodiness to it that I like."
"Much better but even this small version looks like the sharpen\\clarity slider is pegged to 11. Scale it back a few notches. \n\nTo quote an earlier reply to someone else about using selective color: \"It is a boring and overused effect that exists mainly to draw attention to a part of the image that the photographer failed to effectively accentuate by using DoF, leading lines, and general composition.

"Stick with the color on this one. You're losing the sense of depth in the b&amp;w. The big black rock is making a massive negative space that is distracting."
"Honestly, what's the picture trying to show? There's no focus, subject, emotion, etc to the shot. Just an out of focus picture of some lights. Maybe the shot has meaning to you, like a blurred evening at a festival or something(maybe a drunken night), but to the general audience it's not all that interesting. My question to you, why do you think it's interesting or worth critique?"
"Are you saying that you think my photo lacks effective DOF, has no leading lines and has a flawed general composition? Or are you merely saying that you don't like the effect?\n\nBecause if it's mostly the latter, couldn't you say the same about *digital* black and white photography? (The photographer failed to capture a scene with interesting colours, masking his failure by turning the image into black and white.) Or about impressionist painters? (The painter didn't master the art of *realistically* painting what he saw, so he tried to mask that by just using fluffs of paint in roughly the right places.) Or about loud concerts? (The musicians are pretty bad, so they just turn up the volume so that nobody hears any of the musical flaws.)\n\nIsn't it, in the end, a choice of the photographer to show something the way he intended it to be seen? You may, of course, disagree with this choice. Hell, you may even dislike or *hate* the photo. But can you really discard a photo, merely because the photographer used an effect that some people think is trite, boring and overused? If so, shouldn't all compositions that are based on the rule of thirds then be discarded, simply because said rule is overused?\n\nCan't selective colour just be seen as another photographic (presentation) technique, like using a shallow DOF or converting an image to black and white?\n\nThese are all genuine questions, mind you. I am *not* mindlessly trying to defend my choice here. I want to know exactly *why* it is that selective colour is frowned upon so regularly."
"mumble mumble pointing directly at the sun mumble mumble\n\nMe, I'd have pulled the ISO right down, gone to f/22 or so and shot slightly to the right, which'd have put the bridge in silhouette and you still would have gotten those lush colours without smooshing the histogram to to the right."
"Definitely do **not** go in closer.  When people do close, isolated shots on a trip, you start to forget where they are.  In other words, tight shots don't really show you are in Vietnam.  \n\nI'd say some of the B&amp;W shots have really dark blacks in them that maybe could be lighter, but I can't really say anything bad about them.  They look good for documenting a trip.  Way better than most vacation/holiday pics.  "
"yes, on automatic, since it is quicker. but I have to stop doing that and start planning the portraits better...thanks..."
"The compression of depth caused by a telephoto lens coupled with the associated effect of only minor separation of apparent focal planes typical of the DoF not dropping off fast enough to introduce more blur to the background in a pure b&amp;w image would result in the subject not \"popping\" to the front enough to make her stand out.\n\nComposition is acceptable. Taken a moment earlier the subject's head would have been in front of the highlight in the vehicle window silhouetting her face and drawing more attention to the subject.\n\nI don't like the effect. Separate from that value judgement, it is stylistically lazy and has been overdone. Early instances of it were novel and interesting because it was technically difficult to do and thus was not widely used.\n\nI'm not sure why you emphasize *digital*, a color negative can be printed in b&amp;w. B&amp;W is often used to obscure a crappy color image in which the color palette isn't pleasing and the change to b&amp;w allows the image to stand (or fail) on composition and other factors. Impressionist painters were using a new technique to more accurately convey the actual scene, the often non-mixing of colors on the canvas allows the eye to see a more vibrant and \"alive\" scene, it isn't \"fluffs of paint\" it is more often a very carefully applied number of colors close to each other to give a depth to the color not available with mixed shades; not sure how that is applicable here. \n\nA photographer should be able to convey a captured image of a scene in a particular way that emphasizes and de-emphasizes certain parts. Their skill and knowledge and experience come together to render a scene. The rule of thirds and the spiral are artistic devices that exist visually in all flat art. They do not need to be followed every time, but more often than not, they make an image more visually interesting.\n\nSelective color is a *digital technique*, not a photographic one. Just as hand-coloring is an additive process to a print, not a part of the photographic process. HDR falls under this as well, as does focus stacking. They all require a decent image to start with, but can make a mediocre image a little better. But they are, in the end, a crutch to help mask a failing in the original image."
"Came for the selective color critique. Was not disappointed. I'm having a hard time determining the subject of the photo (both versions). Is this an ad for a hair-color product or a backpack? What's the story behind the photo? Why is she turned with her back to the camera? "
"i love the picture. but you know what the problem is? the title. it really tells you what to think which i personally hate. especially when the photo is so well composed, beautiful edited and a great shot!"
"I think that it is a tiny bit washed out, play with your settings a little more.  Also, the eve in the top left is distracting.  Keep at it!  "
"I like the shot, but I'd like it even more if you had the models gaze pointed upward. Then you could see a splash of color even more in the eyes. Great work! "
"I think it stands out just perfectly. There's so much that could of gone horribly wrong with losing the outline of that white bird in a light gray background. Excellent job! "
"What's a \"laser sunset picture\"? Is that a thing?"
"Thank you for your well thought-out reply. This sheds some more light on the issue. I agree with much of what you say. And you are right, of course, when you say that selective colour is a (digital) additive process and not a photographic technique.\n\nBut having that said, I *still* think selective colour can enhance an image when done right. I really don't think there is something *inherently* wrong with the technique. Overused or not. Should newspapers stop putting some words in cursive to emphasise them, simply because the style is overused?\n\nBy the way, with how you describe impressionist paintings (\"Impressionist painters were using a new technique to more accurately convey the actual scene, the often non-mixing of colors on the canvas allows the eye to see a more vibrant and \"alive\" scene\"), you *almost* make it sound like the HDR of the old days. (I don't particularly like HDR, by the way. Occasionally it can positively enhance an image, and then only when *very* subtly used.)"
"I kinda like it actually, The singularity adds a lot to the blank sky I think. Maybe that's just my style though. "
"Fair. When I see someone with a cane I assume there is something wrong with their leg, I see selective color and assume there is something wrong with the image that required using it.\n\nUsually the selective color usages that are the most successful are ones where the background is not desaturated completely but rather the color is dimmed just a bit to make the subject pop in a more subtle manner that could be attributed to favorable lighting.\n\nUsing italics is a perfect example of this effect, it is a lazy way to force emphasis to a particular part of the whole without recomposing the sentence to create that emphasis naturally.\n\nYes. Subtlety is key in all of these additional effects. I also do not like HDR on the whole.\n\nI don't usually look at a photographer's other works in an effort to isolate my critique to an isolated image (unless i'm trying to diagnose a camera/lens issue), that said, I looked at some of your other images and they are quite good. Drop this one from the portfolio, you have much better pieces."
"I agree entirely.  Great image, bad title.\n\n*Show, Don't Tell* is great advice for photographers and writers alike."
"What were your capture details?"
"I chose grey scale because those bricks were brown and that bird was brown-grey. So the bird would've blended in regardless. Also at 1600 ISO on a T4i it starts to get a little noisy."
"This is mostly digital noise and compression artifacts. There seems to be a lack of anything sharp, the overly heavy-handed editing to bring out some contrast in the clouds decimated the detail in the grass."
"Taken in November 2012. Nikon D70, 18-70 3.5-4.5 kit lens. 35mm, f/14, 1/800. ISO was probably something around 800 or so."
"I have to admit that I went for the obvious on that one. I was thinking of asking you what would be a better title but I thought that I myself should come up with something better."
"Good technical demonstration of a composite image with excellent subject matter. Aesthetically, i think composition needs some work."
"don't think so--I just thought yours looked like it had a laser making it different from other sunset pictures."

"It's an infrared image with heavy processing as you mention, intended to give a somewhat unworldly aspect.  My camera is a converted Nikon D70 which isn't the greatest for IR because it tends to concentrate the histogram into a narrow range.  So when you process it some noise and artifacts show up.  Oh well, it's all for fun."
"How about \"Out For A Walk\"? "
"He could be on his way to a massive family reunion."
"It is street photography, the person doesn't have to be facing the camera.  I feel as if street photography is a snapshot of a beautiful moment in time that wasn't supposed to happen. You are looking way to into the picture, which is one of the problems with this sub, IMO. Instead of looking into the small details, how about people just look at the whole photo itself?\n\nI took one look at the photo and recognized what the story was, what the subject was, and why she has her back to the camera. If you are not from America, it would be understandable to why you don't recognize all of these things, so that is understandable.\n\nShe is at the memorial for the Twin Towers in New York. She is paying her respects to those who have died. You are left to wonder if she lost someone in the attacks, or if she is there just to pay her respects. But that in itself tells a fantastic story."
"Can't really see anything in this."
"Selective color can be okay if done right, but I believe that the B/W is way better for the setting of this photo. It gives it a better mood.\n\nI think the photo is fantastic! I would pull back on the clarity and sharpening in your edit, as well as straightening up the horizon. It is slightly off. As for everything else, I think it is spot on."

"Totally agree. It is a cool subject but the way the post was done really detracts from the final product. Maybe a simple shot with no post, shot pretty dark with the contrast of the bright clouds, would really make it more ominous. People would really need to strain to see what the round object is."
"Ah yes, I knew there was something wrong with the term I used. It's italics, of course, and not cursive. I do not think italics should be avoided at all cost, though. Yes, it's all about structuring your text so that it's not necessary to make it readable. But when used sparingly, it *can* put some extra emphasis on a word that would otherwise be just another word. I don't think it's testament to sloppy writing to use italics every once in a while.\n\nAnd I feel the same with selective colour. I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree here. And that's fine, of course. It's good that different people have different tastes. I've tried a *partly* desaturated style once for [this image](http://www.flickr.com/photos/zsnajorrah/8583407601/sizes/l/). Is that the effect you meant?\n\nThank you for your kind words regarding my other work. I do like this photo, though, so I think I'll kindly and respectfully dismiss your advice."
"Thanks for the feedback.\n\n&gt; I think that it is a tiny bit washed out\n\nWich part? The firework, the buildings or all together?\n\n&gt;  Also, the eve in the top left is distracting. \n\nYeah, i was shooting trough an attic window and there was no way to avoid it. I could remove it in the cropped version (http://i.imgur.com/JkvbCo8.jpg) with an contant aware fill. Dosent work on the full composite though, since there is firework underneath. \n\n&gt;  Keep at it! \n\nOkay.\n\n"
"Thanks for the feedback.\n\n&gt;  Good technical demonstration of a composite image with excellent subject matter. \n\nI don't understand all of these words, but thank you. :-)\n\n&gt; Aesthetically, i think composition needs some work.\n\nCould you elaborate a little bit more? I'm not sure what that means. "

"random lens flare put over her hand? and looks like the whole images is blurred out apart from the face and it looks kind of badly/messily done\n\nnot sure what the intention of this image was but it seems like you didn't spend much time doing it \n\nspend more time when using brushes to blur/colour things etc and think about what you what to achieve with the image before just adding loads of random effects"
"My go at a color version: http://imgur.com/ayhIdcR\nThanks for your input!"
"How about just: \"the walk\""
"I think it really needs a subject."
"Yeah, thought about that, haha. Also there was a huge mosque nearby where people started to gather."

"I really like this one. Simple."
"Not giving me much to be honest. \n\nThe background is too blown out to give me anything of interest. \nThe fence ins´t very interesting aswell. The depth of field is too narrow. \nI had to enlarge the image to find the sharp spots. If you were going for the structure of the fence itself like the rust it would have been better to have more in focus.  \nBokeh alone can not make up for a missing subject. "
