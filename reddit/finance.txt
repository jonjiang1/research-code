"Well, I suppose working as hard as I can to make great investments is something I can get behind.\n"
"Yup. I've done these (I think?) with Northwestern Mutual and Mass Mutual and all they wanted for me to do was whore out my group of friends. I don't know if this is what you're talking about, but this side is generally not worth it unless you have an awesome group of people in your business network."

"VP isn't high in the banking world..."
"The most salient thing I've found is data quality.  Bloomberg has the best market data quality I've seen, which will in the end save you the most time. That said Reuters is cheap as fuck.\n\nPerspective: Quant."

"So true. I had an internship offer from NWM and dumped it for a lifeguarding job (summer break position). Sorry but sales is sales and I'm not spending years of my life and thousands of dollars to get a sales job. "

"lol, this is not a book for a high school student. I doubt he has enough math or statistics background nor economic or financial knowledge to understand any of it. \n\nThere was a post on /r/investing with a list of some books that might be helpful to you.[[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/166ha8/what_are_rinvestings_favorite_books_future_side/)] I also recommend you start there, /r/investing is much less intense than /r/finance and usually offer more relevant information to newbies.

"Moneyweek has been peddling this shit for months in order to get you to buy their magazine subscription and to invest in their offshore tax haven schemes.\n\nNone of their figures provided or used are adjusted for inflation and talking about something like gross debt without providing context (such as gross debt as a percentage of GDP) is just so they can scare you with big numbers.

"I don't work in the finance industry; I'm just here for the information. Why do you say to go for the 7 and forget the 6?"
"hey man, fellow highschooler here, i enjoyed \"the neatest little guide to stock market investing\" by jason kelly and \"the intelligent investor\" by graham in that order."
"These fast cash advance loans are usually small and short-term financial products to cover up loan borrower's unexpected expenses till forthcoming paycheck. By way of online cash loans, a small cash loan can be borrowed immediately. "
"It's an info-mercial for subscribing to money week - for those intelligent enough to know that investing in stocks/shares/whatevermnoney week is offering is probably a good thing, but too lazy to do proper research. \n\nI think the overriding themes are true but it's not as bad as they make out."
"There is true and everybody knows that huge profit in commodity market and also huge losses in MCX market. If you have don’t have good knowledge and you can’t take the decision right time then you got loss. Because any business can be risky if you done properly, if you don’t understand things about business that how to run properly and how to take action on the right time. If you really want to get some money in commodity market then you have to take free Commodity trading tips and choose best advisory company.\n"
"A lot of people will recommend Graham's \"Intelligent Investor\" and while it is an invaluable resource, it is a very tough read, especially for a beginner. I'd save it for later, after you've gained a bit more knowledge before you tackle that one.\n\nI'd start with Clason's \"The Richest Man In Babylon.\" Read that one a few times, it's short and easy to read. Then move on to Malkiel's \"A Random Walk Down Wall Street.\"\n\nBest of luck!"
"If you have the 7 you don't need the 6. You could study for two exams or just go ahead and pass the 7."

"I second the idea of holding off on Intelligent Investor but certainly read it after a few beginner books. There's a reason Buffett still touts it as the book that changed his life. \n\nI think two good intro books are Pabrai's Dhandho Investor and Ponzio's F Wall Street. Excellent overviews of value investing. Nice thing is these books actually discuss investing and investment process as opposed to just telling anecdotes from the financial industry. Feel like I wasted time reading too many Liar's Poker-esque books before finding the good stuff. \n\nTwo other resources: 1) reading lists from hedge fund managers on Market Folly, great finance blog to check it out if you're not familiar, and 2) [Buffett on value investing, couple pages, great read!](http://www4.gsb.columbia.edu/null?&amp;exclusive=filemgr.download&amp;file_id=522)"
"CFA level 1 books, you can easily buy old ones. "
"Also, the art of speculation, by Philip Caret. He mentored buffet (it's a value driven book, speculation had a different meaning then)"
"I had an internship at a similar firm. They may be legit and will sponsor your series exams, but you probably will work for commission, which will be nothing until you get a book. You may also end up owing them for your desk and your leads.\n\nGo on the interviews and see what they have to offer. If you're good, smart, and driven, this can be very lucrative. But so can finishing school."

"When genius failed. Interesting readings gives good insight into the careers of some of the biggest names in finance.\n\nFor trading read trend following, and the books on the turtle traders. \n\nYou should also get a subscription to the WSJ and keep up on general finance news."
"The reality of sales is that you are talking people into parting with their money in exchange for something. Within this there is a lot of scope. \n\nAre you going to work as an assistant to someone who targets wealthy Saudis for 10 year billion-scale infrastructure projects? Then your work would involve a great deal of cultural learning, interaction with interesting people, and the development and shaping of detailed and comprehensive pitches.\n\nAre you going to get a brief note about a penny stock, and a list of people to cold call during their lunch break to get a couple of thousands invested, and do this over and over? Or maybe you get a phone and are told to create your own leads? Then you might find it tedious and not great.\n\nFrom the company's perspective, they may simply pay you on commission, so you cost them practically nothing and they get most of what you earn. The standard perspective of \"wow I am so grateful for their kindness and trust in hiring me\" may not work as well for when the money you get a the end of the month is solely a portion of what you made them during the preceding month. \n\nHowever - firstly, the key bit in that kind of sales is somewhat a talent for speaking on the phone and convincing people who like you, but to a larger extent, motivation. And by contacting them you have shown motivation. If you want to have a learning experience then keep showing motivation. Secondly, cushy jobs and great terms don't grow on trees. If you want to get into sales, then there will always be a bit of a scope for you to pick what you sell (you won't get a piece of crap and be told to sell it, but may take your pick out of a couple and choose your own pitch) and to make the best of it. People selling good things also need salespeople and you won't find and get that job without experience."
"It was one of the first books I've read about investing, and honestly it's not very good except maybe the first two chapters. I don't know why people recommend it. The gist of it is don't get emotional and don't trade what you can't afford to lose."
"Thanks, that's great to hear as I also have an IT background."
"One up on Wall Street - Peter Lynch\n\nIt'll make you realize how simplistic investing is."
