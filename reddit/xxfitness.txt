"Well, it sounds like a two way street here. The thing I learned is that people actually care a lot less about what you do, you what you think they do. Maybe they feel guilty about eating what they really want, so they eat what you are eating in order to avoid confrontation. And why does someone putting agave in their drink bother you.\n\nI think you might be taking things a little personally, and thats okay. But letting things go every so often is okay. :)"
"Omg I'll be sure to stop at forever when I can. What a steal!"
"I have also experienced a similar thing with allergies--in high school, I always had trouble breathing even when I was doing martial arts regularly. I was tested for asthma but didn't have it. It took leaving the state for college and encountering new allergens for me to realize it was the air, not my body. Once I was diagnosed with seasonal allergies and started taking regular medicine, it became much easier to build up my wind through swimming and jogging."
"I gave up on expensive stuff and started buying men's sweatpants from Walmart.  I then cut the legs off.  They have nice deep pockets for my music player, keys, and inhaler.  They also have a nice drawstring waist."
"I allow myself to snack on \"comfort\" foods that week, but I don't buy snacks that are high calorie or high sugar. My comfort foods are chocolate and cheese, so I'll have chocolate pudding with extra protein, jalapeno cream cheese dip with celery, etc. I also allow myself some cheat meals, since it can be discouraging to be too strict with yourself. \n\nI think it's also okay to go over just a little bit, because your body will naturally balance out with a lower appetite and tiny increase in calories burned during the week of your actual period**. Also, a small fluctuation in weight based on your hormonal cycle is completely normal, so changes in a range of 2-4 pounds is not necessarily detrimental to your overall progress.\n\n**I read a study on this, and have also noticed the effects personally. I'll try to see if I can find the study to link to when I get home."
"I've had three running belts, flipbelt is my favorite by far. I can't even tell I'm wearing it and because it has pockets the whole way around I can put more in it (I even sometimes wear it to walk my dog so that I don't worry about things falling out of my pockets).\n\nEdited to add: also, even if you do find shorts with pockets, the phone will probably just bounce around and bother you. At least that is what I have found with putting objects bigger than say a credit card or a house key in mine."
"I had this same question when I upped the intensity in my routine! I also had super realistic dreams that were hard to distinguish from reality. After a couple months, I guess my body adjusted to the change, and I'm back to mostly dreamless sleep. Couldn't tell you why, but you're not alone!"
"I've found the polar watches on amazon and I believe I got my red ladies polar watch I believe it's the FT7 for $67. I had bestbuy price match amazons price. I leave the heart rate band and watch in my car so when I go to the gym I always have it."
"For me, there was just no good time to start. I went on vacation in November (this was around the time I wanted to start). Then Thanksgiving, then all of the potlucks at work, then all the Christmas parties. When you're first starting out (this is my second stint) it's hard to resist temptation when your mind isn't set in its ways just yet. So Until late March, I have no other parties/holidays or any of that other crap to tempt me and it's just a good start point. I do not go around bragging it, though. I kept it between my boyfriend and I to start eating better and get a little more exercise. I don't need to go around telling people for any satisfaction. My results will be my satisfaction and that's gonna take quite a bit."

"I did NROLFW while training for a half. Most of the training programs I did called for at least one day of strength training and then I added on 1-2 additional days for lifting. In the beginning when my mileage was lower I typically would have 3 days of 3-4 mile runs and lifting or lifting only. As mileage increased I had more like 1 day of lifting only and 1 day with a 3 mile run and lifting. This seemed to work well, but make sure you are eating a lot and listening to your body so that you do not injure yourself!"
"This is totally me. I feel like it's the easiest way to do it. I used to over-think how tired/cranky/lazy I was feeling and talk myself out of working out. But I eventually caught on that once you start your workout, those feelings go away 99% of the time. If they don't, you go home, and you can be fine with that. But that almost never happens.  Now, even as a pretty big gym addict, I still find myself feeling really \"meh\" on the way to the gym, but I don't sweat. I just try not to picture anything past the gym entrance until I get there and it works out!"
"Isn't that the weirdest thing?  Why are we denied all that pocket space? \n\nI bought a rash guard for my husband and it was way too small for him so I tried it on, and big surprise, it has a massive zippered pocket on the back!  I've never seen a women's rash guard even a tiny pocket.  Plus it was like $20 cheaper than the women's version."
"Any recommendations for (preferably cheap) workout pants that have a smaller waist-to-hip ratio? The ones I've tried from F21 and Old Navy fit my hips and butt, but gap at the waist. They also need to hold up for squats/deadlifts/etc..."
"My mom and I both thought we didn't have asthma, either. She was in the army, I was forced into a season of track in high school (yeaaaaars ago) and, more recently, started playing ultimate frisbee. We both wondered why it seemed so much...EASIER for other people.\n\nThen during a frisbee game I went from wheezing (which I ignored - I don't run, my running cardio just sucks is all, gotta keep chasing the disc) to full-on hyperventilation. It was terrifying. \n\nI told my doctor, I got a scrip for an albuterol inhaler, and suddenly I see why everyone else but me (and my recently-diagnosed mom!) had it so much easier than we did.\n\nTldr: sometimes you don't find out you have asthma til way later than you think you should."

"3 years ago I made a New Year's Resolution to lose weight. I'm 5'9.\n\nI started off 260 pounds and completely out of shape. \n\nNow I'm 176 pounds and lifting 3x a week, running 4-5x a week and recreational activities when I can. It took that mental psyche up to give me the push to start. I just carried it over year by year. I'm hoping this year will be my last year of losing with 10 pounds left. :) "
"All my pretty clothes are from boutiques, department stores and women's fashion chains. All my functional clothes, like workout clothes and cold-weather stuff, are from the men's section. It seems like someone out there thinks women don't need *functional* stuff."

"I have the Champion running shorts from Target. They have big pockets and they're really soft. Sometimes I wear them as pajama shorts, even. They might be the same ones."
"It's really more than met my expectations. It works great. It looks good. It goes with everything. Even if it doesn't it hides easily and comfortably under a shirt. It works comfortably with any size phone(I have a note 2.) It's been great for running and working out as it keeps it snug against you without rubbing our jarring. It's even great for travel if you need a money belt. I know i sound like a salesman but I'm just super stoked with it! Best of luck and happy New year!"
"I've had it for a couple months and it's awesome... I am realllly happy with it. I love using it at the gym, biking with it, and hiking with it. It tells me when I am in fat burning zone versus fitness zone based on heart rate.

Practice mentally responding in these situations and build confidence that you can deal with them if they come up in your life :)\n\n"
"Yes, this. Absolutely this. Here's one of the many images on the relative density: http://healthnutjulie.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/muscle-vs-fat.jpg\n\nTo the OP: You don't know how much muscle you've gained and fat you've lost in that time, you may have gained 6kg of muscle and lost 2kg of fat, which would probably make you physically smaller. It's definitely a tough mental hurdle to get over, but please measure inches as well as kg!\n\nIf your goal is absolute weight loss, strength training may not be the solution, but if you like how you are starting to look then focus on that and not the number. Plus, that number will probably not continue to go up as much as it has; newbie gains and all that."
"If you enjoy cardio, try doing HIIT (high intensity interval training) rather than long distance steady state. Add weights a couple of days a week and you should be all set. Maybe one long run a week if you really get zen from it :)\n\nYoga and pilates aren't specifically for fat loss, but good all round to do once a week or so.\n\nDepending how new you are with paleo, the carb crashes will wear off, don't worry. Make sure you're getting enough fat (coconut oil, butter, etc are great) and don't try to over-cardio while your body's running low-carb, I found it took a few weeks of experimenting with intensity, carbs via sweet potatoes/fruit, etc before I got a good balance that worked for me."
"Thank you for picking my birthday as your random example day!\n\nGyms love new year's resolutioners, as there's a guaranteed fall-off. Regulars hate it as the equipment gets super-busy for a few weeks and the classes get full. Tells you a lot about human nature.\n\nOn the other hand, if a January 1 hangover (of the alcohol and sugar variety) after a month of over-indulging is what it takes to kick someone up the butt and finally get them to make healthy changes, I'm not going to knock them. Good for 'em for trying. \n\nBut I totally agree with your point about whether people do it because 'everyone does it' (and therefore it's ok to fall off, because everyone does that too) -- vs making changes for themselves that happened to be spurred by the spirit of change."

"Ah! I started having creepy vivid dreams doing Zombies, Run! too! I have no idea why. I made it up until the last three workouts and had to stop when I was sleeping alone at night when my boyfriend was working nights. I started lifting about 3 weeks ago and my dreams got vivid and scary again. \n\nIt's some seriously messed up stuff too! Like I've dreamed that someone was standing over me in my bedroom-every detail was exactly the same down to my stuffed horse Lil Sebastian. I've dreamt of falling into the shark tank at the Baltimore Aquarium,  a snake being in my bed, and crashing my car over and over.\n\nI love working out, but the only other time I've ever woken up more scared was when I had bronchitis and dreamt some creepy ass dude was strangling me when I was sleeping over at my sisters house. Now I just pop a sleeping pill, cuddle my stuffed horse and ride the tiger. "

"I love that you have a stuffed Lil Sebastian. The person watching you sleep was prolly just admiring the stuffed horse. "
"If you're satisfied with what you see in the mirror, ignore the scale. The 4kg is likely a combination of moderate gains, increased fat (because you aren't doing SS right otherwise), and water weight from increased sodium and carb intake. If you're that concerned, you can try dedicating a week to cutting water\n\n&gt;If I start tracking my calories to a deficit, should I be able to lose weight while making progress on SS? \n\nUp to a very limited point. The rapid increases in strength that most people experience on linear progression programmes are down to neural adaptations rather than increases in muscular mass. When those peter out, you'll start stalling because your body lacks the nutritional and caloric surplus to build muscle.\n\n&gt;Should I switch to a program that doesn't leave me as hungry? \n\nSS is a fairly low volume programme in the greater scheme of things. If it's making you ravenous, most other programmes will do far worse."

"I use a stick blender for all my smoothies (protein and otherwise) and have never had an issue. My recipe is generally soy milk, protein powder, natural/greek yoghurt, and banana pieces. I know a lot of people like to add extras like peanut butter, honey, or vanilla essence - all of which would be fine. The only recipes I wouldn't make with my stick blender are those which use frozen fruits, as I'm not sure the motor could handle it. I also wouldn't use a super-unripe/hard banana unless I cut it into very small pieces first. "

"I mainly just eyeball it, but the general idea is ~4 scoops of protein powder (either cookies and cream or double choc), 2 bananas, 5 big tablespoons of yoghurt, and about 1 cup of milk - stick blender handles it just fine!

"&gt;to burn fat and lose weight\n\nNothing.   You lose weight with a non-trivial caloric deficit over a significant period of time.  Therefore, if you dial-in your eating habits so that you're losing weight, than any additional 'calories burned' are \"free weight loss\" ( calories burned are  impossible to accurately compute outside of an exercise physiology lab and can cause more trouble than it's worth. ).\n\n**tl;dr:  Work on your food choices first, they're the most important factor in weight loss.**\n\n\n"

"Could I do deadlifts more often in SS and not mess anything up? I *really* like deadlifts (somewhat masochistically), and I don't feel comfortable doing power cleans."
"I'm just starting my own fitness journey now, too. I've been doing cardio consistently for for about 8 months, and I needed that time to become committed to my workouts and my health. Now I'm moving up to what will really work... Adding lifting to my routine. I am planning on doing 3 lifting days, alternating from Upper Body, Lower body, and Upper body while doing intense cardio (running) on 2 or 3 days a week while I'm not lifting. I'm pretty committed to becoming a runner, and it's important to me to develop that skill that I've hard worked at.\n\n I'm a newb, but being around other like-minded people at the gym is helping, plus I'm able to not feel so intimidated by some of the machines. "
"For me, cutting out processed foods is key. Weight lifting is where I see a huge difference rather than cardio. I prefer cardio because to me, it's easier, but I make sure that's not my main work out. Never. Skip. Leg. Day."

"I have a timex watch/strap combo that I got for about $35 off amazon.  It works well for tracking my heart rate and syncs up with the machines at the gym automatically.  It's not super fancy but does what I need including tracking workout duration, calories burned (calculated using my weight), average and max heart rate."
"How much are you deadlifting relative to your body weight? "
"You can continue a high protein diet, which would help but unfortunately you are likely going to lose some strength if you can't lift. However, when you do return to lifting you should progress back to where you were pretty quickly."
"I agree with what others have posted that the holidays are a huge factor in why fitness is such a popular \"new years resolution.\"  You've got the candy indulgence holiday followed by the gluttony holiday followed by the cookies and chocolates holiday then wrap it all up with the empty calories of alcohol on new year's ever.  Combine that with traveling and parties that make getting into a routine especially challenging.\n\nPlenty of people can and do start working out and getting fit other times of the year.  But weight gain from the holidays is often a big motivator in those who start on Jan 1st.  It's a convenient time to start a new habit now that the disruption of celebrations is more or less out of the way."
"About a year ago, I started lifting again after a several-year break. The company I train with has an interesting style. We train to temporary muscle failure. This means I only do one set of about 9 to 12 reps, making sure the weights are heavy enough so that I can only do 9 to 12 reps. I didn't consciously change anything else about my other workouts or my eating habits (except I added a post-workout protein snack), and I still lost more than 2% body fat in just a few months."
"It's my diet that helps me lose weight. The heavy lifting makes me look fabulous instead of just thinner and doughy. \nBut now I don't even focus on my weight anymore. I use my clothing and how I look as a guide.  \nI do the traditional bulk and cut periods. Been bulking over the winter to gain strength and simultaneously be able to eat whatever I want for the holidays. I'm sure I've gained at least 10 pounds but my clothes all still fit great and I've picked up some very respectable increases in all of my lifts. But January is cut time. So now it's back to carefully watching what I eat, and eating at a deficit. although I still lift heavy 3 days a week.\n\nUltimately I lost 50 pounds through changing my diet over a period of 2 years, but weight lifting has been giving me the aesthetic that I'm looking for. \n\nOh and I also do cardio on my off days."

"Meditation ties into many things!\n\nBut no, I'm implying that progress is tied into feedback :) \n\nI believe it'll go faster if you have a teacher, or another student, that you can share your chat with.

"Building on what others have said, lifting is going to shape your body in new ways, but you must eat correctly in order to burn the fat (and see the muscle)! Try [EatThisMuch](http://www.eatthismuch.com/) for some examples about how much you should eat given your current stats and goals."
"One scoop Trutein Chocolate Peanut Butter Cup, 8 oz. milk, ~1 tbsp. cocoa powder, ~2 tbsp. peanut butter, and a pinch of salt.\n\nI was happy when I realized the bitter cocoa would cut the excessive artificial sweetness (endemic to every protein powder I've tried) and give the shake a rich flavor. The peanut butter adds texture and, again, a richer flavor. I'm told it's excellent with a frozen banana, too, though the smell puts me off."
"A quick Googling suggests that they are a minimalist style of shoe with not much in the way of padding or cushioning, which means that they may be nice for lifting! They seem to be similar to other minimalist shoes, which means your legs are probably going to need some adjustment time to get used to them."

"I've been lifting for a couple years all while losing weight. Honestly, weight loss is more about diet than workout program. Your workout is mostly for health, looks, and to make weight loss easier since by exercising your daily maintenance calories will be a wee higher.\n\nTweek your workout to what you have fun with most. The difference for weight loss in terms of program A and program B are pretty small, and it's not really worthwhile to stress over that. Focus more on diet."

"So diet is definitely key to losing weight but lifting gives you an incredible body while doing it.  I lost 90lbs through diet alone, but when I was done my body was kind of dumpy.  In a way I was still kinda lumpy, so I decided it was time to lift.  Seriously, cellulite gone.  Ab definition....

Sometimes they're really vivid and I just have to go \"whoa, brain, where'd you pull that out of?\", but they're usually not scary.

I've laid off the running since getting Runner's Knee in Sept, but I'll be back at it in the new year and I'm not looking forward to zombie dreams. Most of my scared-ness happens before I sleep, though, watching the closed door to my room and praying zombs don't know how to operate door handles."
"Don't worry about the scale right now. You're not really trying to lose weight, right? You're trying to lose *body fat*. When you lift weights, your muscles get stronger which means heavier but that's fine, muscle is good, muscle makes you healthier and hotter and a whole host of other good things. People who start lifting weights often find that their weight goes up but their measurements go down, because they're losing fat which makes them thinner, and gaining muscle which makes them heavier. This won't happen forever, but while you're a beginner it is possible. Appreciate it while you've got it, it's the holy grail of fitness!\n\nIf weighing yourself makes you freak out, don't do it. Take progress pictures, take measurements, but if you want to lift and yet have anxiety about gaining weight, stay away from scales."
"i want to start lifting but i'm so nervous to go to the gym and not know what i'm doing"
"I am going to quote an old post of mine, maybe you will find some of it helpful. :)\n\n&gt;Lifting weight during fat loss is primarily for mitigating muscle waste. As you eat at a calorie deficit you are going to lose fat and muscle, resistance training helps you keep some of the muscles you already have, so you'll have less work to do once you get to your goal. Another reason mitigating your muscle waste is important is that you will have higher lean body mass at your goal and it means you will burn more calories because you have more muscle (and who doesn't want that?!)! &lt;- This is what people talk about when they mean you will burn more calories (or you have put on muscle but that is a different story since you are doing weightloss).\n\n&gt;In terms of calorie burn, cardio is going to help you lose weight faster unless you lift a LOT. Running is a very inefficient activity so it burns a lot of calories.\nIn terms of your lifting, I would suggest doing something like compound lifts three times a week something along the lines of:\nMonday: 3x5 squats , 3x5 flat bench press 1x5 deadlift and 3x8 dips Wednesday: 3x5 squats , 3x5 flat bench press 3x5 powercleans 3x8 pull-ups (assisted if needed) Friday: Repeat monday.\n\n&gt;Anything more than this is overkill. You aren't going to build muscle on a caloric deficit. You need to eat a LOT to gain muscle, over your daily caloric expenditure, and you won't do that while losing fat. What you are doing with 40 minutes of weight training is unnecessarily fatiguing your muscle and wasting time you could be burning more calories doing something else. If you aren't eating like an animal, there is no point lifting like one. You may find you are able to lift heavier weights due to conditioning your muscle though (and that is always awesome).\n\n&gt;break break\n\n&gt;Now, I see that you are 185, Hey! thats 10 lbs less than I started at! I'm 140 now, and I'm gonna tell you what I did. I know you didnt ask for it but I'm gonna tell you anyway because I love sharing it!\nIncline treadmill. You get the resistance training in your legs AND the burn of cardio. It is brutal. In 40 minutes you would burn probably around 500 calories, which is more than you could hope to burn in 2 hours of weightlifting at your current level. Now, this resistance allowed me to maintain almost all the muscle mass in my legs, they are like tree-trunks now, and I love it. (I was obviously maintaining a caloric deficit the whole time this was happening, weightloss is 90% diet after all). If you would like pics I am happy to share!\nLifting on your way down is good, lifting is always good, any exercise is good, but you could maximize your efficiency with compound lifts and more cardio.\n\nKeep in mind this was written for someone who was more than just 15lbs overweight, but the general premise is the same :) "
"Thank you very much :)"
"I guess I'll just have to try. Thanks for your advice."
"I got a squat rack ~$100 and 30 lb barbell with weights (80 lbs) for total of 110 lb max. I think that was ~$100 also.  I am so happy with it. \n\nI love doing squats, sumo squats, backward alternating lunges, deadlifts, calf raises etc. I started with just the barbell to perfect my form and have been slowly adding more weight. It will take some time for me to be able to squat 110 lbs so I feel this was a great investment and I can slowly progress at a healthy pace. I'm not trying to be a power lifter, I aim for 12-15 reps with perfect form. \n\nI think you need more more weight with less reps if you want to build mass. "
"Pumpkin pie smoothie: 1/3 refrigerated can of pumpkin, 1/2 cup almond milk, 1/2 ripe banana, pinch each of cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, allspice or cloves, 1-2 tbsp almond butter, scoop of vanilla whey. "
"Perfect, those are all really close to me. Thanks :)"
"You are looking more toned in your thighs too!  I really appreciate reading your progress reports, great job.\n"
"You likely need more weight. 30 reps says endurance where hypertrophy (increased muscle size) is generally considered about half that. Dubbed *The Glute Guy*, you can look up [articles such as this](http://www.t-nation.com/free_online_article/sports_body_training_performance/dispelling_the_glute_myth) by Bret Contreras. [This article](http://bretcontreras.com/gluteal-goddess-workout/) of his gives both a beginner and advanced workout with advice you could work into your current routine:\n\n&gt; When someone can do 20 reps of something, I move them up in ROM (for example – go higher on step ups, go lower on box squats, etc.) or add resistance (for example – have them hold onto a dumbbell in the goblet position during box squats, place a barbell in their lap during hip thrusts, etc.). "
"After almost a year of weightlifting 3x/week, I have only lost around 5 lbs although I eat a fair bit more than I used to. My appetite is much higher though, so it's harder to eat less.\n\nI had hoped to have lost 15 lbs by now but no cigar. To some extent, I fell for the xxfitness circlejerk that you can lose weight by lifting weights. This isn't true. You lose weight through diet, not exercise, period.\n\nThis isn't to downplay how much better my body looks and how much better I feel, but you don't lose weight from just lifting. "
"After I lost my job at the end of September all the stuff I worked off in 2 months came back. I was disappointed but I been depressed and emotionally eating myself. I just plan of focusing on my fitness and a job will be second. "

"Haha, yeaaah. I put it so that the back is against my skin, but it still gets pretty ick. I've tried putting it in my waist band... it either falls through my pant leg or else it slips out over top! I tried making my own arm band with a sock... I didn't have the right sock. I refuse to buy a proper arm band though, I'm so cheap. &gt;_&gt; "

"yes! stick to what you like! a thing to be wary of is that, if toning is a thing you're interested in, cardio activities tend to take MUCH longer to produce the desired effect. of course people get really toned with yoga and such, but it tends to be the people who have been doing it for years...\n\nbut you're in this for the long haul anyway so who the fuck cares, right?? have fun!"
"I like the way you think! ;)"
"However the average weight gain per year is only [one to two pounds](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/press-releases/diet-lifestyle-weight-gain/). Considering a pound of fat is approximately 3500 calories and muscle mass burns 42 extra a day it would only take 83 days to lose one pound of fat with no change to diet, thereby effectively canceling out the yearly fat gain with extra to spare. My point is that small amounts add up over time."
"I use frozen blueberries and raspberries in my shake every morning. My stick blender handles it wonderfully."
"Lifting was the ONLY thing that helped me lose weight. Cardio never did anything for me. I lifted for a little over a year to get to my first goal weight (and fat percentage), then I went Paleo and reached my second goal weight (and fat percentage). \n\nLifting helped me lose because it helped me gain muscle, which I didn't have much of. Before starting to workout with my trainer, I got my metabolism tested and found out that I have an abnormally low metabolism, so I had to gain some muscle to boost it a bit. Lifting helped more than anything else. \n\nI lift heavy with low reps, just like the big boys, because I was smart enough to know I wasn't intaking enough calories to bulk up. As soon as I started doing that the fat just melted off and I started toning like crazy. It was absolutely awesome. After going paleo I stopped working out as much and let my diet keep me skinny. Now I pretty much eat whatever I want, whenever I want, (so long as it's paleo) and workout/lift about once a week. "
