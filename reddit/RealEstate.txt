In other words, make it seem like they might lose your offer due to their stall tactic?  If they keep asking for more time, they probably see your offer as valuable and wouldn't want to completely lose it (even if they're just interested in that offer as a starting offer)."

"$100K income will almost definitely not be enough to secure a ~ $600K loan from a bank.  "
"The rule of thumb is you can afford three times what your annual salary is.  You are WAY beyond that, I'd be surprised if you got hte loan."
"I think you're reading too much into how much money you'll really make at the end of the year. I made 100k this year, actually more outside of salary, but my last pay stub was for 100k gross. Minus 17,500 401k, 1,800 medical, 7k FICA and 16,500 taxes. It put me about 56k for the year. I live overseas so I'll get my taxes back which is great. I own a house that cost 150k and lots of cash for investing and toys. 700k is a fucking ridiculous amount to pay for what I'm assuming is your first house. That's a 15 or 30 year debt, do you really think you want to shove all your money into that and have nothing left over for that long. And shit, you live in CA so there's stupid high state taxes too. Fuck that noise, 100k ain't shit for what your looking at, unless debt slavery is your ultimate goal.  "

"Point of order: here in Florida this would not be a legally binding contract if they sign it at this point (unless specific language is added, which *you* would then have to sign off on also).  I'm not licensed in California, but I'm 99.9% this would hold true there as well.  \n\nThink about it: you said you'd pay X amount in an offer expiring on the 27th (for example).  The whole reason you *have* an offer and acceptance deadline is so that a buyer can't be held to the terms of an offer they (rightfully) thought expired days, weeks, or months ago.  If the seller's signature comes after that O&amp;A deadline, they may as well have signed their dinner menu for all it matters to you.\n\nIn practical terms, what usually happens is the seller (or whichever party is stalling) will sign, date, and add a short phrase that says something like \"Buyer and Seller agree that effective date of contract shall be [some new date, usually that day or the next day depending on time constraints].\"  As long as everybody's cool with that, both parties initial the additional clause and you're back in bounds.\n\nI agree 100% with other comments that the sellers are most likely using your offer to either attract or leverage other offers.  It's probably not a huge risk for them in the type of market you describe, but they *could* end up in a situation where everybody gets sick of being jerked around and they wind up with no offers.  If you ultimately reach terms with them, pay special attention that your contracts are watertight, which this one isn't so far.  I would consider myself to be bordering on malpractice if I let an offer expire without my sellers understanding that they were basically declining that offer.  (Sounds like that's not exactly their intent in this case, but intent doesn't override written contracts in real estate law.)  As my first broker and mentor in this business told me, \"Flimsy contracts aren't a problem until they're a problem, but then they're a problem.\"  You don't want to get weeks into the escrow period only to have them find another buyer and come back to you saying, \"sorry, turns out our original contract was never valid, so you're outta here.\"  (There would be avenues to fight this, but obviously you don't want to get that far into the weeds when it's completely avoidable.)"

"To hammer in the point, this is an absolutely terrible idea. I know a family that pulls in ~250k a year, living in a 600k house in rural south bay area, and they're only now starting to pull their heads up with only one kid in school. Their monthly mortgage payment is 3k+, with a single working parent and the other parent handling investments and yard work every day. Obviously having no kids helps, but they are extremely good with finances and make a lot more than you. Obviously a nonrural house costs less upkeep, but even with a doubled income you'd be stuck in this lifestyle for a long time with a 700k house. "
"I hadn't even considered hoa in my post, but you're absolutely correct. Especially in a law firm, he can't guarantee employment for the long term or an improvement in pay for several years, and beginning law firm employees often work very difficult hours. There would be no wiggle room, especially if he expects to keep hauling 100k since many jobs won't pay that much beginning, which means his life will be decided for him for those years, and loss of income would mean bankruptcy"

"Parents have been renting for about 25-30 years now. That's how long they've been in this country. I can't understand why they were scared to purchase a home during that time. We've lived in 2 properties in that amount of time with nothing to show for it.\n\nNot owning my home terrifies me. I don't want to repeat what my parents did. Now they have nothing to show for their monthly expenditures and will continue to have to rent unless they move in with me or I pay rent for them. \n\nMy plan was to literally throw every expendable dollar one retirement deductions were factored into the house. That way I'd be able to pay it  off sooner, and then move to a different location while renting out this house. My area is growing rapidly and I don't have any doubts that I wouldn't be able to find well-qualified renters."
"You won't get the loan.  \n\nYou need to have at least 6 months employment BEFORE applying to even be considered.  Proof of employment is worthless, since you could be fired before even getting the job.  Even then any half-decent home affordability calculator will show that you can afford maybe a 600k home with 140k down payment.  You're going to have to be working a bit longer and making more money before you can afford a 700k home.  Your parents could co-sign the mortgage, if they have income.  Also, the 40k you get from the family member must be a gift, ie. they would have to sign forms saying that it was not a loan.  If you don't declare it as a gift, it will simply decrease the amount of actual loan you can get, after you have 6 months of employment.\n\nAsking for a 1% stake is weird, and I don't know how you would do that formally."
"Hell no. Lol. Aerial video"
"How much are your property taxes/homeowners? \n\nIf it's a purchase you have to pay transfer taxes as well, which vary depending on the state but are usually 1% of the loan amount for the buyer. "
"Sure, I can make it read like a gift. I'll just owe them money unofficially. That's not too much of an issue.\n\nIf I need at least 6 months of actual employment, I'm going to lose the property I have my eye on. While disappointing, I can certainly appreciate why that is the case now. \n\nI'll need a property attorney or real estate agent that's well versed in joint ownership, but I think the 1% can be done (and in my case, is somewhat necessary)."

"Having bought a few houses, those look like fairly common closing costs. \n\nAlso, if you haven't actually got a contract on a house yet, you can try to negotiate the sellers paying quite abit of those costs. Doesn't always work, especially in multiple offer situations, but you won't know if you don't try. Talk with your Realtor and see if it is common in your area. "
"Yes, but you're looking at it in the wrong way.  Renting is really not the same as leasing a car and then not having anything at the end of the leasing term (as opposed to buying a car and owning a car).  If you only rent, all the extra money you would have spent on the mortgage, etc. is yours to invest and make additional money.  Renting is definitively NOT just throwing money away.  You pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to take out a loan to purchase a house. When you rent you do NOT do this. \n\nSo it's a very different financial prospect.  That's why there are many online housing calculators that talk about whether it's better to rent or buy.  This is not the \"whether you can afford it\" question, but rather, \"is it a better investment to buy or rent.\"  That really does mean that in some areas you SAVE money by renting, meaning that the extra money you have, you invest and make money outside of real estate. \n\nNow, I think I was in the same situation as you.  My parents ended up giving me (CA Bay Area) a buttload of money for a downpayment.  If I did not buy a house, I wouldn't have received that money.  So the \"calculator\" is already off.  But I own a house now, and was in a very similar situation.  \n\nMany of the other people are right, but wrong in several ways too. The CA Bay area is INSANE right now with housing prices.  Limiting yourself to a house 3x your annual income is prudent, but unfortunately very difficult in CA bay area.  That's really not what I did either.  I have a house that's 5x my annual income.  I live in Peninsula, and completely know what you're talking about.  \n\nHowever, for me, the bigger issue is employment history.  For me, they needed to see three full years of income history before giving me the loan I needed.  My situation is probably a bit different, since I'm mainly an independent contractor (and also that the loan I was applying for was a jumbo loan).  But still, I think you're going to have a hard time finding a loan without putting in a little more time into the job to show work history. \n\nBut yes, while it IS difficult in the bay area, I would also state that it's not going to be as impossible as some others say.  I don't think you're going to get a $700k house, but I don't think it's unreasonable to say $500-600k house (with $100k or $120k downpayment).   There are other major financial issues though, as you're probably discovering, but I know the CA Bay Area quite well and survived it. Good luck!   "
"If it's joint ownership, can they co-sign and help out?  Then you might have a chance at going for the property that you're looking for sooner than later.  "
"Btw, where specifically are you looking in South Bay?  $600-700k for a 3-5 bedroom/2,000 sq ft seems low actually.  Unless you're looking in slightly sketchy areas like East Palo Alto.  Sunnyvale?  "
"Oh, as you might find out in research, you probably already know that you actually need much more than simply the 20% of housing cost for downpayment.  To get the loan (at least I did), I think you also need to show that you can cover an entire year's worth of mortgage payments, which, in your case, would probably be an additional $40k+ of cash sitting in your bank account.  Pretty significant addition to your calculations.  "
"This. Exactly this. I would say time is up and move on, they are using you to upbid someone else or worse wasting your time seeing if any other comparable offers come in.\n\nYou have no obligation anymore they went over the stated deadline."
"The only limit to times you file bankruptcy per year is time. You could file then change status a few times per week for 52 weeks. The auction will be suspended and postponed the first five times.

I've seen it does however have an effect on bidders. "

"even though the property is in the Flood Zone, the house may be one foot above the base flood elevation, (is the house on a raised foundation, or on a rise or mound of some sort?)\n\nIf it is one foot above the base flood elevation, then you will not be required to purchase flood insurance.\n\nElevation cert will determine whether or not the house is above the limit.  \n\nContact the escrow company, maybe they can arrange to take the fee for the flood elevation cert out of the purchase price and refund it to you."
"Single/26/M you can rent. Besides, your future wife will want to find a new house that you didn't have any other girls in. \nEdit: I just read some of the other comments, /u/mingl specifically.

"And I'm saying they are not.  There will be correlation, but it isn't as high as versus the 10-year.  I know it's counterintuitive, but 30 year rates are priced off of the 10 year treasury, and it's due to a mortgage's DURATION - which is far less than 30 years.  look up \"Bond Duration\".   \n\nIn short, mortgages amortize (principal is paid each payment) and can be called (e.g. Prepaid early).  Treasuries don't have those features - it's just an interest bearing payment.   This amortization and call feature shortens the effective duration of a mortgage loan considerably. "

"-How much to pay for his services?\nYou shouldn't have to guess at this, if he's a professional there should be some type of pricing sheet somewhere you can start negotiations from.  I'd be a little leery if there wasn't a price sheet and ask for professional references &amp; a portfolio, then offer a lot less than asking price.\n\n-What the potential value this service would provide?\nIf the unit is on a decent lot, has any view whatsoever, or has an architectural detail that stands out, these shots can really draw people to the listing and hopefully those can be turned into showings. \n\n-What kind of shots/views I should commission?\nMore important than what is when, which is late evening to twilight.  Make sure that his copter has the stability to take low ISO shots at long exposures for best results.  Other than that, look at the unit and think about what stands out to you.  Since you are marketing this property you need to figure out your pitch first then consult with the photographer to get the best results."
"Absolutely,\tI'd call their bluff and walk away. If its still there in a bit I'd throw out a lower number out of spite."
"Why do you feel you need this over, say, conventional (albeit professional) property photos?"
"With regard to qualifying there are a couple of hurdles, the first being your Debt to Income Ratio (DTI).  Usually with a prime credit score lenders still want to see a DTI lower than 30%.  With PITI at current rates (and some assumptions), DTI on the 800k+Down Payments is looking close to $4400/m and your income is \"only\" $8333/m.  That's a better than 50% DTI and would make that an extremely risky loan.  Now, there are lenders out there that will lend up to 55% DTI depending on your front end/back end ratios but it's going to be MUCH more expensive to go that route.  Long story short, your actual budget is probably closer to 400k-500k with your anticipated down payments.  The second sticking point is length of employment, most lenders want to see two years at the same job, however some will make an exception of you left one position for another in the same industry.\n\n\nRental income won't count in a DTI calculation unless you have a signed lease agreement with deposit checks in hand (and even then it's up to the lender).  That's not something you'll be able to count on for the front end.\n\nIt appears your best option, based on the information I have available, is to co-finance with your parents and buy them out as you go forward.  That would solve a lot of issues with one swing.  Consult your Realtor or Loan Officer/Broker for more options, and make sure you consult with more than one LO.\n\nWith regard to the aggressive pay down, I would definitely consult with an accountant before you go that route.  There are a ton of tax strategies around the first five years of home ownership that actually make this a BAD idea.  Most of my clients in this price range end up with significant tax benefits due to home mortgage interest deduction, home office, etc.  Currently, interest rates are still historically very reasonable, you should take advantage of it.  As far as specific costs, it varies wildly from state to state, but if you're planning on coming to the table with 200k, they are going to be a small fraction of that so you shouldn't be too concerned.\n\nMy honest opinion is that this is a great idea in a great area to do this.  When you are just getting started like this, these type of aggressive investments are the difference between retiring at 40 and maybe not retiring at all.  Looking at historical price trends and economic climate of the area, you'll probably do very well with this long term.  Your income should grow over time, you may add a second income to your household in the future, etc making things more manageable in the future. \n\nGood Luck, I hope you find a home you absolutely love!"

"While it is a good time to buy, you don't have any work experience.  Rent for now, save like mad and get about 2 years worth of tax returns ready.  You'll need those for the loan.\n\nAlso it's far too much debt for someone coming out of school without any work history.  You might burn out within a year or two and want something different.  \n\nSo the two years of tax history will not only be good, but most likely necessary for the banks to lend to you.\n\nA couple more years isn't terrible."
"It doesn't matter if you \"lose\" that property. You can't afford it right now. There are other houses out there."
"We have the same situation in/around Boston right now.  Some friends made an offer on a 3-family home in Somerville that was listed around $650,000.  My friends offered around $720,000 the property it ended up selling for around $850,000.  Crazy talk."
"Home equity line of credit (HELOC) was a common way to bridge the gap between Jumbo and FHA loans last year when the rates were much farther apart (~0.5% instead of 0.125%). You can still look into it as an option for bolstering your down payment."
"Yes, this is the best strategy if you don't care about getting the house.  If you do care about getting this house, consider that this strategy may very well cut off negotiations with the seller, or best case, put you in a worse negotiating position should they try to cut you loose and you have to come back to them.\n\nMost likely, they are negotiating another offer and holding yours as a backup.  Or they're giving themselves more time to collect offers and hopefully make more money.\n\nI find it interesting that people think this is being manipulative.  It's a business transaction, and it's not the seller's job to try to make the process as quick, easy or inexpensive as you'd like to it be (and likewise not your job to make it that way for them).  It just so happens that it's a seller's market, so you don't have much negotiating leverage.  Sucks, but that's the reality.  \n\nDon't blame the sellers for doing what you would likely be doing as well if you were in their shoes.\n"
"If you haven't yet offered your max, and if you really want the place, I would suggest increasing your offer to your max.  Psychologically, you may not be happy with that strategy, but a couple weeks after you're moved in and settled, you will have long forgotten how annoyed you were.\n"
"1) You won't get a loan. You will have to work/rent for a year before you have a chance at a mortgage.\n\n2) Even with $140k down you won't be approved for more than 450k. Lenders are still going to look negatively on these gifts, because they were not your own income. And if you bought that price you would end up living paycheck to paycheck after all of life's other expenses.\n\nI hate to be harsh, but you need to stop looking at ways to swing this. I'm not sure how you convinced yourself that $600k was even possible. When you are in a  comfortable place to actually purchase a home you need to take an open look at you income and expenses, when I got pre approvals from lenders I cut 30% off what they approved me for and have been firm on my price point. I do not want to live paycheck to paycheck, and lenders are willing to give people more than they should."
"I disagree. There's a deadline that's already come and gone from what the OP said. Barter all you want in the window of the deadline. But if you won't negotiate a deal by the end of that time, you're crossing the line. It's a simple process: just say, yes or no. I shit-can negotiations that people try to draw out like this and always encourage others to do the same. "

"When I graduated law school about 10 years ago at about your age, I bought my first house for about $250k.  It obviously wasn't in the Bay Area.  If it were, it would have been @ $1.3-1.5 million.  I was making a bit over 100k a year.  And I had a shit ton of law school loans, which you haven't mentioned at all?\n\nI started making payments on the house and realized I didn't own the house-- the bank did (I put less than 10% down and had to pay PMI).  And I was young and single, but had all this crap to deal with-- the lawn, the pool maintenance, the worry about when to replace the roof on the house, etc.,. when I would have  been better off just partying more and having a life.  Instead, every Saturday I did yard work and went to the hardware store for whatever house project was on the list.  I'm a pretty handy guy.  I know you're thinking about buying new construction, but don't think for a second you won't have things to deal with just because it's new.  \n\nAfter selling, I moved into a nice apartment instead with a great view. Rather than having my homeowner's insurance deny compensation when a tree fell into my pool and blocked my garage access after a big storm, if anything went wrong with the apartment, I just called them to repair stuff.  \n\nAnd if you think you're a lawyer and won't get pushed around like that, I sue companies like the one you work for all the time, but there's a loser pays fees provision for bad faith claims in the state where the house was, and I didn't want to take the risk for a relatively small amount of money that should have been covered but was denied.\n\nI knew the bubble burst was coming, so I sold that house in 2006 before the crash.  Imagine if I wasn't smart enough to do that?\n\nAnyway, it turns out I hated owning a house, and I then moved to Los Angeles where I couldn't really afford to buy anything worth buying, so I had been paying rent ever since.  Compared to dropping too much money on a house, paying rent and investing in companies like Apple when the stock was at $80 a share has probably done me much better than buying a house from a financial perspective.  (Though a neighboring house next to the one I sold did sell this year for $340,000, and my house was much nicer.  So maybe not.)  \n\nSo, fast forward to a few weeks ago, and I bought my second house.  I am now well established in my career, and I have the ability to absorb unforeseen problems when they arise because I have way more assets than I had when I was starting out.  I've got a wife now, so she can take the time to meet the cable guy when they give you a \"11-5\" time frame to arrive to install the cable, and doing some landscaping and gardening with her will be far more fun than doing that kind of work alone... or having to kick a lady friend out of the house early on a Saturday morning so I could work on the house.\n\n**TL;DR:** there are a lot of hassles and headaches of owning a home if you buy before you're in a point in life where you're actually ready to own a house.  I don't know if your story about where you feel your parents wound up is sufficient to put you in a position where it would make sense *for you* -- but it didn't work for me when I was fresh out of law school and starting a stressful demanding career.\n\n**P.S.**  Have you even passed the bar yet?  There are people from Boalt and Stanford who fail each year...  \n"

"And I disagree.  Ignoring the deadline was a decision that the seller made as part of their negotiations -- maybe it helps them, maybe it hurts them, but it is certainly within their rights to the ignore the deadline.  In fact, the sellers could argue that giving a less-than-24-hour deadline was crap negotiation on the buyer's part.  But again, both sides have the right to do whatever they need to try to get the deal they want.\n\nIn other words, you, the OP and anyone else can be as offended as you'd like, but ultimately, this is a business transaction, and neither side has the obligation to negotiate in the way the other side might want.\n\nBtw, while you may say that the seller engaged in crap negotiation, the fact that it's been three days and the buyer is here on Reddit soliciting advice tells me that the seller still has the upper hand.  As someone who has negotiated professionally in the past, that tells me everything I need to know..."
"One more thing to add to my points below:  \n\nThe deadline everyone keeps referring to was imposed by the buyer, not the seller.  The seller never agreed to that deadline, and the purpose of putting a deadline in a contract is solely to protect the buyer, NOT TO OBLIGATE THE SELLER TO RESPOND IN A CERTAIN TIME FRAME.  \n\nIt may be the HOPE of the buyer that the seller responds within that time frame, but to think that the seller owes that to the buyer is crazy.  The seller owes NOTHING to the buyer whatsoever prior to a contractual agreement.\n"
"You are certainly welcome to go through life inconveniencing and misleading people with passive-aggressive tactics like this one but I certainly won't do business with you on the principle alone."
"Obviously, but they keep asking for one more day. That's the part if would find infuriating. Say no and counter. Not hard."

"I spend 7.8% of my take home pay on rent.  If i can keep my current arrangement as is I will continue to rent indefinitely."
"Unfortunately earning $100k/year in the bay area is like earning $50k/year in most other average-sized cities (it's just average).  There is absolutely no way a bank will approve you for a loan that is 6-8x your annual income even if you can scrape together the money from your family.\n\nWhy the need to own a house with 3-5 bedrooms and 2k sqft?  Why not something smaller/less expensive?\n\nIf I were you, I would try to rent someplace as cheap as possible, save as much as you can, and get out of CA and move to a city with more reasonably prices homes and a much lower cost of living index.  You'll be able to live much more lavishly on way less income (if that's what you want). "
"I spend 0% on rent because my house is paid off."
"Without 20% down it will be difficult for you to qualify for a conventional loan (provided it's less than 5 units) with 70K to put down you should be fine. Where there may be issues - your income per month. You must have significant reserves and a qualifying debt to income ratio in order to qualify. You may want to speak to a local credit union, because they can keep your loan in house and give it to you on their own terms if you don't qualify for a conventional mortgage. "
"My rent includes all utilities (heat, electric, water, etc).  I pay $0 for property taxes and no home owners insurance.  I hear what you're saying, but I like not being tied down to a single location."
