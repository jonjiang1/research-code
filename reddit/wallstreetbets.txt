"Can you please explain how this is working out?\n\nWhat happens to AMR's debt? What happens to AAMRQ stock? What happens to LCC stock?"
"SGLB I wouldn't go in above .17.\n\nI'd cash out 0.2-0.22.\n\nBut in the long run, the skies the limit for the stock.\n"
"AMR debt gets paid with AAL shares. LCC converts 1:1 to AAL. AAMRQ holders get leftover of whatever after paying debts.\n\nWhat matters for us is that over the next 4 trading days, creditors and AAMRQ holders will get paid, after other complex calculation, base on the average price over the 5 days. This event will happen once a month until April, then all debts will be paid and AAMRQ holders reimbursed.\n\nThe stock rallied 2% today. AAMRQ should receive a hefty sum if this continues."
"What makes you feel the recent gains are unsustainable?  \n  \nHave you compared it's market cap with similar competitors and the average for biotech start ups with it's successes?  \n  \nDo some reading over the weekend, both here and on Investor's Hub."
"Nice catch. \nNow the question is will it be positive. If its not out Thursday morning, I might make a move to go in really heavy. "
"Looking at his past articles, I going to say almost 100% chance this will be positive. \n\nHe's written 4 positives articles on ONCS since July - 7/11, 7/17, 8/19, 12/17\n\nWho wants to look at the day before / day of / day after the articles to see what the stock did? I'm on mobile which makes it a bit difficult. Will have time tomorrow if no one beats me to it. "
"Given the nature of biotech stocks: they shoot up with hype, they drop when people realize the drug won't be out for a while, etc."
"I got ya bro.  I made you a present:  \n  \n**http://imgur.com/cgpfx0Y**"
"Hey check out the chart I made from his other articles:  \n  \n**http://imgur.com/cgpfx0Y**"
"I can see that.  But with a market cap of tens of millions, ONCS is vastly undervalued considering that it a.) has some unique treatments, b.) they recently had a prestigious doctor come from Merck to work as their Chief Medical Officer for a piddly salary but about 1.5 million in stock options, c.) the hype train for ONCS won't even be full steam until late January because there are several conferences and announcements coming up.    \n  \nBut don't let me talk you into it.  All penny stocks and biotechs are very risky.  I'm willing to lose my money, though I obviously don't think that's going to happen.  \n  \nDo your own DD, and trade wisely!  But you'll certainly be welcome on the ONCS train.  :)"
"Oh and I also should thank you.  I think you were the one who first turned me onto ONCS in the first place!"
"Metals are a terrible investment for 2014, in my humble opinion.  \n  \nI believe technical analysis is soundly defeated by speculation and economic realities.  I also believe you are seeing what you want to see.  \n  \nWe are in a massive stock market run up, and you are buying leveraged risk on something that by it's nature is a bet *against* the market?  \n  \nThis is not good risk/reward ratio!  Please reconsider!"
"Nope wrong guy. I don't really play any penny stocks, more of an options gambler."
"I already sold my position for a small loss, didn't like the action.   I also don't think it will be a good year for metals, but then again you never know when the next economic catastrophe is going to hit. They tend to come out of nowhere. I always keep a few coins in my drawer just in case\n"
"So do you think we will be better off after all disbursements than right before the merger when it was trading around $12-13?"
"Truth is nobody knows for sure. But basing on a few analysis on yahoo forum, if AAL price stays in the ~$25 range you can expect to get 30% gains compare to last day of trading (which was $11.90).\n\nOnce the first distribution happens, then we can have a very close estimate. Nothing concrete till then\n\nImo buy as much as you can on dip if you can afford to. Not only will it help your distribution, AAL is still very undervalued relative to the other airlines. I am betting on good gains come earning report"
"Thanks! I like presents, especially the kind that can make us all money. \n\nIf history repeats itself, then this seems to be a pretty safe play. If history doesn't repeat itself, then FML. "
"I'm also currently betting on SGLB. As for ONCS, no real reentry as of now since the options play is very new."
"Congrats to all who held these bad boys"
"I'm in ONCS until at least 80 cents depending on how quickly that comes.  If it happens too fast, I'll start to take profits."
"LOL, we literally just posted our topics at the same time.  \n  \nI just posted the new 2014 $10k Challenge.  \n  \nI suppose if all you have is the $2700, and that's a psychologically significant amount then you can just apply a ratio to it.  \n  \nThe principals are similar."
"I too like to live dangerously.\n\nThough right now I am very confused with the rules and I am far too lazy tracking everything. I will updates on my trades on whatever fancy me.\n\nSee you on the moon.\n"
"Rules are simple.  \n  \nTake $10k of any asset you choose that you already own (including cash).  \n  \nTrack it's value honestly over the course of 2014.  \n  \nMost return wins.  \n  \nWe agree to be honest about our returns, and not inflate them or hide losses."
"Well, I have $10k but I don't have $10k I can lose. I have a separate 55,000 shares in ACTC in my penny account. I do need to eat and buy a few things here and there, so I don't want to risk everything I have. \n\nStill, I like that you issued the challenge. I'd definitely like to see some other people getting in on this so we have the best flow of ideas possible. "
"&gt;Take $10k of any asset you choose that you already own\n\nMight be hard since I have a tendency of all in. I will try to keep track of the ratios.\n\nI will have an additional 0-40k to play with once my AAMRQ gamble comes through over the next few weeks. "
"Perhaps use $2500 and multiply everything by x4?"
"Hey I'll be posting in about less than two weeks with roughly your amount of dollars. Good luck to you and AP "
"Okay, I will take your challenge :)\n\nI elect to keep all 10k in cash.  See you in 1 year!"
"Oh yeah we can use the ratio. It's a little different when you have 4x to play with, but we'll see how it goes. "
"After reading your question again I think you're looking at intrinsic value, the difference between the strike and the underlying. There is also something call extrinsic value comprising of time value and volatility value. Out-of-the money options are priced on extrinsic value alone, while in-the-money options are priced on both extrinsic and intrinsic. \nIf the value of the stock is $10 and the strike price of the call is $14, there is no intrinsic value, only extrinsic time and volatility value. To price this, one would commonly use a program utilizing the black-scholes formula. Most options brokers include this feature for free. \nHope that helps answer your question. Investopedia is your friend btw. Plenty of quality info for free. I'm no expert yet, but I believe we're all teachers and students in life. "
"TZA closed @ 16.97$\n\nI just purchased 2000 shares to hold in January if we see a correction, so I will put down 589 of my shares for the challenge!  "
"OK, I'll play. $10k into FAS. I'm feeling bullish for 2014 and so far FAS has treated me rather well in the past two months.\n\n"
"I'm working till 0100 tonight, then going straight home to bed, not much party left in me these days...  I might manage to crack a mini bottle of scotch just to make me fall asleep faster and take the pain and suck out of my life for a few hours though.  And that's sort of like partying. "
"Seems like a pitch more than an analysis "
"I don't have any money on this one, so I couldn't care less if anyone buys any shares or not."
"Too far OTM IMO"
"$10K on NSPH."
"I think its a waste of $120+commissions.  This is gambling."
"I'll trade you some doge for some ONCS shares ;) I could always use some more. "
"The thing with MJNA and several other similar stocks (PHOT, CNIB) is that everytime there is positive marijuana legislation, you will see a jump. It's a smart buy if you can PAY ATTENTION when this happens.\n\nOtherwise, they are subject to the same market forces everyone else is.\n\nBuy low, sell high. (aha, sell high. I make myself laugh.)"
"Hey listen,\n\nThis guy is learning about the stock market. His trading fees may currently be a higher % than what you deem advisable, but ultimately if this guy is making money and learning something, stop shitting on him.\n\nAnd penny stocks make plenty of people very rich, so stop discouraging it. It's like a poker player discouraging a blackjack player; different game, same house. \n\nAnyway KyleWrap, carry on with your bad self. I hope you make some money. There's 100 haters for every penny you make."
"Happy new year!!! "

"10K on CSCO.  Don't forget about my post come time to count the cash."
"Surprisingly little hangover.  Played with some friends at the club.  \n  \nDid some flirting, dancing, and other stuff.  Ended the night drinking vodka down some girls back.  \n  \nYou don't have to be the 1% to live like a rock star.  Matter of fact, if you go ahead and do that now, you'll have a clearer head as to why you want money in the first place.  \n  \nHappy New Year peoples.  2014 is going to be an incredibly profitable year for all of us, I have a great feeling.  Enjoy it.  The Great Crash of 2015 is coming."

"My turn! I only chose a part of my portfolio to make it about 10k. Good luck everyone!\n\n- 200k MDNT @ $0.03 = $6k\n\n- 4 AAPL 557.5 weekly calls @ $3.35 = $1,340\n\n- 5 AAPL 560 weekly calls @ $2.2 = $1,100\n\n- 15 AAPL 570 weekly calls @ $0.45 = $675\n\n- 3 NQ June 14 calls @ $3 = $900\n\nAll weeklies expire January 3rd. "
"Idk man, I've been watching Doge go down steadily for a while. There's just no value to it. It's crazy easy to mine, and not good for anything other than converting to BTC. If you want to play Cryptos,, get on BTC talk and look for coin announcements (new coins) and mine them, if they end up getting added to an exchange, congrats you just hit it big. I did it with CatCoin when it was added to cryptsy last week. As I've done with SexCoin, ElephantCoin and EarthCoin. "
"Im a poor mofo but i am gonna watch and try to learn. My whole portfolio is only $600. I have a 401k but that doesnt count."
"Did you buy MDNT at 0.03? Right now it is about .025. Just wonder."
"You're crazy! I love it! \n\nThough I'll decline. I love watching all your bets and growth, but I'm really just too cautious to actually participate much in WSB or something like this. But I love the \"thrills\" of living vicariously through you all haha."
"Not fair. You already won the challenge."
"Oh I am very well aware it's at $0.025. Yup I bought at $0.04 and $0.02 for an average at $0.03. Always thought about buying more because I do believe I can make big money off it, but I'm wary of it being a year old penny stock. "
"Hmmm...I thought you were done with penny stocks or at least not all in on something?"
"why NSPH?\n\nI use to follow it, but sold it on the way up last spring. Haven't followed it since."
"I've got be honest, this may not be the best thing. Everyone's just saying alright, I'm throwing this there and not backing it up with substance. It's frustrating for me at least that I put a lot of thought into my stocks and did a post like yours and this, among other random I'm putting $10k in X posts, are clogging up the front page along with it. "
"So why the F did you just post this, I thought you didnt want to clog the front page?  http://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1u51p2/ive_been_talking_with_americanpegasus_heres_my/\n"
"im in, how do we validate the portfolios?"
"Right, I've been talking with AmericanPegasus about details, putting a lot of thought in how to grow $3k quickly, and then wrote a very detailed post with my analysis of picks. I was hoping for some discussion, as there was with AP's post. Instead we've got a bunch of people posting \"$10k challenge\" posts with a one liner or few lines in the text that **add absolutely nothing of value to the sub**. I don't give a shit if you put $100mil in a stock if you're just going to say this is what I did. I want analysis, discussion, consideration, of which the other posts do jack shit to perpetuate. It's frustrating for me because at face mine looks like just another shit post, when in fact I try my very best to spark discussion and thought. \n\nFurthermore, nobody else is posting an ounce of proof. Fuck that. If you want me to believe you put $10k in MDNT, post your portfolio. Lets see your million shares in a 1mil volume stock. \n\n[tldr] Posts like AP's original $2k challenge added value to the sub because it prompted lots of discussion and analysis. Other posts currently are just one-liners and add nothing. No proof also sucks. "
"ATHX is going to be easy money in the first few months of '14. SIFY is going to be a nice earnings trade that you can get in and out of quick with about 30% gains by the end of this month"
"Hey OP, or should I say Rob Close? Your articles suck. I hate you. "
"10k on $7 jan 15 calls NBG."
"PHM is trading at an all time high. Why should I believe the expectations for better earnings haven't already been priced in?"
"Um good luck tomorrow? "
"Yea I thought about putting my NQ shares or options for the challenge, but I'll live dangerously. By premarket I'll know if I'm screwed or not..."
"Why is the CEO of SZYM paying himself $2.5 million/year when the company hasn't performed very well?"
"Long SGLB and ONCS. Eyeing SLTD but it seems like if their pending patent was worth a shit someone would have bought them out already. "
"The executive salaries at SZYM seem kinda high given that the company hasn't performed very well.\n\nMy climate picks are SPWR, SCTY and KNDI."
"He's paying himself a $2.5 mil payment package. 2012 was only $515k cash. The majority, $1.6mil, was in options tied to stock performance. That's a great ratio. The company hasn't performed well, but that's definitely being felt by the executives. "
"Thanks. SZYM is on my watch list, but that has been bothering me. Makes a bit more sense."
"Also, have you compared KIOR? Bill Gates is heavily invested in that and I believe they do the same thing."
"KIOR is an garbage company and a garbage stock. They don't actually do what they say they do, they have no real product pipeline, and they'll be gone very soon. I know a couple guys who have been short KIOR since September last year who are loving it. It's very rare you see a company with over a 100,000% net loss. KIOR is one of those companies. "
"Check out FNMA/FMCC. If you're looking for high risk high gain stocks, the court cases they are in the middle of could easily result in a price point 10-20 times higher than their current price point."
"What makes you think MDNT is going to bounce back?  Their last 6 months has been abysmal.  "
"What is the deal with this company?  Down 90% the last 6 months.  What is on their horizon?  Is this a potential money maker?"
"I've posted it elsewhere, but basically their current stock price has their market cap at 800k, which I find extremely underpriced. Add to that the construction of their new movie studio and hopefully the nationwide release of their new movie Yellow and I think it stands to gain. \n\nIt's absolutely purely speculative  which is why I don't have more money on it. It's extremely prone to violent swings and manipulation, which is obviously scary. 6k is probably my threshold of what id be willing to lose on a bet like this. "
"Also on this train, would like to hear why you have faith in them."
"&gt;10-20 times higher than their current price point.\n\nI don't see this ever happen. Aren't FNMA shares already diluted by 80%, regardless of conservatorship? That means, in good case scenario, FNMA would worth ~$10 even if there is zero wind down and no conservator.."
