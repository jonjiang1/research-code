"When an officer gets in trouble for something there are two investigations. There is an administrative and criminal investigation. The administrative investigation is conducted by the departments internal affairs unit. You will be placed on paid leave while the administrative investigation takes place. This is to get the officer off the street while the investigation moves forward, but at the same time allows them to have a stream of money for bill, groceries, etc. While on leave you cannot leave your home. You are basically on house arrest. You have to be at the beck and call of the department everyday in case they want you to come in and answer questions. When you are questioned they  sit you in a room with the chief and several other high ranking police officers. You are read Garrity. Garrity is basically the opposite of Miranda rights. Under Garrity you are required to answer all questions truthfully. If you refuse to answer a question or get caught in a lie you will be fired. However anything you say under Garrity cannot be used against you in the criminal trial because it would violate your 5th amendment right against self incrimination. Nothing found in the administrative investigation can be used against you in criminal court, however anything found during the criminal trial can be used against you in the administrative investigation. So the criminal investigation is usually done first, then the administrative afterwards. Because the administrative is usually done after the criminal, that's why it often takes time for the firing to happen, because the firing won't happen until after the Administrative. Once the two investigations are complete, then the punishment is handed down if the charges are sustained. The media doesn't always follow up on the case, so all people read in papers is \"officer got in trouble, is on paid leave.\" The administrative \"paid leave\" is just the beginning. The punishment can range from nothing, to firing, to being indicted by a grand jury and spending the next 30 years in prison."

"YES I WAS USING HYPERBOLE, THANK YOU FOR POINTING THAT OUT.\n\nMy point stands, even though we *both* know I wasn't literally suggesting that passengers could carry firearms on board. Do you hate security? How much of a hassle it is? Would you choose an airline that promised that its security would not be a hassle? Many people would, and they would not be able to determine if security was less of a hassle because it was streamlined, or because it was reduced.\n\nSecurity protects the public. Corporations protect their profits. If security is run by airlines, then security will be optimized to make airlines profitable, which means, of course, that there would be one airline with very low security, to get the market niche of people who hate security and don't fear hijackings, and one airline with very, very high security, to get the market niche of people who are paranoid.\n\nOf course, if somebody decided to crash a plane into a building, they would buy tickets for the low-security airline, because nobody would hassle them for anything suspicious, because the profit comes from low-impact security, and any security officer who held up the line would be fired immediately--because terrorism is not frequent, and customer dissatisfaction is constant.\n\nThis is the risk of privatizing public services: the incentives for private companies often do not align with the public good. In this case, that's moral hazard: the airlines do not feel the risk of lighter security as much as the public does. As long as they make more profit, they'll tolerate more attacks. If you can prove that more security will improve the profitability of the airlines, then the security would improve; otherwise, security would actually get worse.\n\nThe free market doesn't fix everything, and blind faith in privatization often leads to boondoggles."

The accusation was that the American government conducts this form of espionage and then passes on the information to the corporations. Those corporations, using inside information, can then win contracts where the German competitors are left in the lurch.\n\nThis was the first I've ever heard of that sort of thing, and I reserve judgement on the matter, until I have more data... but this was a documentary on German public television, in much the same style as dark documentaries on PBS about intrigue in various levels of industry - such as in the financial sector."

Based on how much we're agreeing on that point alone, I'm tempted to demand that we kiss or something, but maybe after dinner or something. \n\nMy point is that no system is perfect, this one least of all. I feel it fills a necessary role, but does so imperfectly. I don't think dogpiling it was a good idea. I think reasonable discussion would have been better. In short, I think 4Chan mishandled this, which is news to absolutely no one. \n\n&gt; But I still don't think you respect what it is being a man.\n\nFrankly, I'm not sure what it *is* being a man. Female identity seems to be pretty established, albeit beginning to evolve further, but male identity just hasn't been spoken about as much. If you'd like to explain it yourself, I'd definitely welcome it. I'd rather hear it from someone who isn't on TV or relying on their book to sell or anything like that.\n\n&gt; I commend you for not destroying your ex-husbands life more than you probably could have (but likely shouldn't have the power to be able to do in the first place).\n\nJust a tiny note on this. I didn't destroy his life. I destroyed all ties I had with him, legally and emotionally. He lied to me for months and wouldn't even admit what he had done, even when the landlord was screaming at me and even when our power was cut. He was punished by the Marine Corps for trying to abandon them. I explained the situation to his family, since he was too far away for them to visit and he wasn't getting any phone calls, and they were deeply disappointed in him. His father especially, since he was a former staff sergeant in the army and took it very seriously. So really, since there wasn't any property between us and we had no children, it would have been impossible for me to wreck his life the way you see other divorces going on. \n\n&gt; But at the end of the day you stood infront of everyone in your life that mattered to you and promised you would love him for better/worse, sickness/health, rich/poor until death.\n\nI was with him under the understanding that he wasn't lying to everyone who ever cared about him. However, that's exactly what he was doing. And after realizing just how willing he was to lie to me about so many things (he tried to convince me he was sterile when he couldn't pay for my birth control, which I wasn't able to foot since I had moved several states with him and hadn't found a job yet) I saw no reason to just say \"Oh well, I still love you, even though you're willing to be such an irresponsible douche.\" And for the record, we had a small ceremony in the mayor's office. No gigantic wedding or honeymoon or anything.\n\n&gt; He had an occupation where the currency he traded in was the ability to unflinchingly take life and die.\n\nAlso for the record, he was an IT guy for the Marines. Yes, he had gone through boot camp, and for that I thought he had grown up quite a bit. Frankly, the fact that I knew he could kill me with his bare hands made me a little timid about speaking against him. He did almost break my neck once by accident when we were wrestling. (No, I did not sue him later for this. It was an accident. I'm not a horrible person.)\n\n&gt; Then you have a problem with guys having \"abandonment issues.\"\n\nEx husband thankfully wasn't one of these, but later on I dated a guy who grew increasingly upset when I would talk to someone other than him. He thought I was badmouthing him behind his back, so he would demand to see my phone and demand that I never speak to my family of anything that went on between us. And frankly, I can't blame him for having such issues. His mother had him when she was 15 and tried to leave him in a dumpster. That's absolutely tragic, but I don't have to subject myself to that just for the sake of being a good girlfriend. I tried to convince him to seek counseling and he refused. \n\n&gt; But if you are going to go around having no respect for men and treating them as such, now it is on you because you will have become the same.\n\nAnd it's a good thing I don't do this. I don't shout at men for being pigs or for being violent or for anything else. They don't deserve it because they're not the ones who did those awful things.\n\nHowever, it's very intriguing that I would have to explain all of this just for you to accept that I should be able to decide which relationship to stay in and whether or not I'm justified in leaving. Reminds me of old divorce laws. But oh well, I'm sure that has nothing to do with any of this."

"The priesthood was extended to blacks beginning in 1978 (not 1969), long after much of the civil rights furor in the US had abated. They point to that as evidence that they didn't cave to public pressure, but that they changed their policy in response to their pleadings with the Lord after many more years.\n\nAlso, to add a bit more accuracy to your glib and bigoted statements, the institution didn't even make it to Utah for nearly 20 years, after having had its members chased, harried, and killed from state to state (much of that before they practice any of favorite grievances like polygamy or racial qualifications for priesthood service). Your comment about killing Indians and what settlers probably makes reference to the Mountain Meadows massacre, which was distinctly NOT the action or policy of the institution, but of bad individuals within the institution. And mind you, polygamy was legal for the first 40 or so years that Mormons practiced it, and it was made illegal expressly as political manvoering in an effort to disqualify Utah from their otherwise qualified bid for statehood.

I don't know why people think \"the cops\" is some big international entity of like-mindedness. Different jurisdictions treat conduct and complaints differently.\n\nWas my original quote which he quoted.\n\n&gt;Non-internal affairs officers often derisively refer to the departments as the \"rat squad\".[1]  \nSeveral police departments in the USA have been compelled to institute civilian review or investigation of police misconduct complaints in response to community perception that internal affairs investigations are biased in favor of police officers. For example, San Francisco, California, has its Office of Citizen Complaints, created by voter initiative in 1983, in which civilians who have never been members of the San Francisco Police Department investigate complaints of police misconduct filed against members of the San Francisco Police Department. Washington, DC, has a similar office, created in 1999, known as the Office of Police Complaints.[2]  \nDue to the sensitive nature of this responsibility, in many departments, officers working internal affairs are not in a detective command, but report directly to the agency's chief, or to a board of civilian police commissioners.  \nInternal Affairs investigators are bound by stringent rules when conducting their investigations. In California, the Peace Officers Bill of Rights (POBR) is a mandated set of rules found in the Government Code.[3]\n\nWas a direct copy and paste from Wikipedia.\n\n&gt;Sounds like somebody has never been on the receiving end of police action because beatings and intimidation are the same in every jurisdiction, language, and country.\n\nWas vague, uninformed, condescending, and entirely tangent from the points I originally brought up.\n\n&gt;Did you read your own fucking link there, chief?\n\nWas a condescending introduction into his copy-pasted Wikipedia article which was, again, entirely aside from the point.\n\nSo what the fuck are you talking about when you say \"He did, you just fail to see it?\""

"&gt; Let's not digress to the validity or not of levitcal OT texts, I tire of that conversation I've had so many times.\n\nUh, sorry but the fact that you tire of it doesn't make that not a legitimate point.  Please, do copy and paste your tired reply to the problem of the terrors of the old testament...  But ya, you don't get to just dismiss it.  Pointing out the horrors of Leviticus is a perfectly valid critique of the idea that the bible is a good moral guide.\n\n.\n\n&gt; It's interesting that a good person with good morals is part of the problem because of where he believes those morals come from, even amongst secularists morality is subjective.\n\nIf you probe, you will find that secularists don't actually morality itself to be subjective, just many specific applications.  They may even THINK that it's subjective, but again, get down to their REASONING.  They may disagree about how to act in a certain situation and say that that's \"subjectivity\" but really it's just two perfectly valid courses of action which have similar ethical value.  They both DERIVED their conclusions by thinking about the happiness and suffering that the conclusion would cause.\n\nI always like to bring Sam Harris' wonderful definition of morality in, because it helps explain the concept better.  Think of morality like you think of food/nutrition and health.  Certain things may be better or worse for certain people and cultures.  Certain things may provide similar benefits but be of a completely different flavor.  Certain things may be beneficial in the short term but bad in the long term.  There may be many things that simply have different flavors and are liked or disliked by various people for varying reasons....  but no matter the differences, biology and health are stills sciences and there is still generally a clear difference between food and poison.\n\n.\n\n&gt; We are all equal right?\n\nIn what respect?  I'm sure you're better than I am in many respects, and I better than you in many respects.  And I'm sure we're both better and worse than everybody else on the planet in many different ways.  In what way are you talking about?  Equality in the eyes of the law?\n\n.\n\n&gt; I have the same capacity for logic and reason as you, and my logic and reason have lead me to my beliefs.\n\nYour logic is flawed and thus I claim it leads you to make poorer choices, which is why I said you are wrong originally.\n\n.\n\n&gt;  Is it that your logic and reason is superior to mine? \n\nThere is no \"my\" and \"your\" logic.  There is only logic.  Logic is a derivative of mathematics.  And yes, I claim my reasoning is superior, because I have logically derived from a more rational source, and I have been consistent in my applications.  You have derived it, or at least parts of it, from what you believe about a super natural entity, which is not a rational basis.  Therefore, yes, I claim my reasoning is superior."

" What are they fighting/banning: rhino horns, or rhino horn poaching? They would be hypocrites if their actions boosted rhino horn poaching (such as if contact with rhino horns made people addicted, and they gave rhino horns away, increasing the market for rhino horns and therefore increasing rhino horn poaching). But if their actions increase the amount of rhino horns (such as creating habitats and reserves, increasing the amount of rhinos and therefore the amount of rhino horns, or not destroying rhino horns they find), there is no reason for those actions to be ethically wrong. Not killing off the species and making rhinos suffer is only the ethical reason, and it's likely many people on charge do not care about such reason; they care about the public relations that result from such laws; they will find the easiest and less expensive way to appear to be taking care of damage to endangered species and other ethical issues, instead of using effort to solve those problems from their root, where the ethical issues actually lie: the act of poaching/deforestation."

"The first is that drug tests don't really work.  They test for pot, and that's about it.  You could go home and get blind-ripped off booze every night of your life or blow coke all weekend on tax payer dime and that would be fine, but smoke the one drug with a decent testing window and you're fucked.  So it's basically a double standard.  The average piss test is effectively testing only for marijuana, and out of most common intoxicants it's the least concern out of all of them.\n\nBut the second reason is that the idea is to save money and it doesn't.  In the long run you'll spend way more on testing than you save on denying those that fail.  You might run a business that has an office supply cabinet, and maybe people steal $500 worth of office supplies from it a year.  You don't think it's right to steal office supplies.  So you hire a security guard for $30,000/year to save $500 in office supplies.\n\nWould that make any sense, as a business?  No, it'd be better just to eat the cost of office supplies.\n\nThere's two kinds of waste that exist, there's the waste that exists, and then the waste you waste trying to uncover and stop the waste that exists, which is just more waste if you spend more doing that than you save.\n\nBig organizations are filled with shit like this.  They identify a problem, and spend far more fixing it than the problem is worth.  So you need to identify your goals.  Is your goal to make welfare cost the least amount it can cost, or is your goal to ensure at *all* costs that nobody gets welfare that doesn't deserve it.  Can't have it both ways.  And if it's the latter, than why are you implementing a strategy that effectively mostly catches people using the substance of least concern?"

You can apply for one here. http://www.aphis.usda.gov/permits/ppq_epermits.shtml\n\nAllowing them to seize and hold the items is a lot harder than it sounds. It requires a change in law regarding several government organizations, the construction of a quarantine facility in every single airport in the United States (Which would require perfectly sealed, proper storage for every single confiscated item, especially the ones confiscated because of the potential to carry disease) training, space, federal judges to determine the legality of a confiscation (because if they make exceptions for some, then everything is up for debate), and money. Lots and lots of money.

"True, it has not been directly stated what is private/public.\n\nI'm not quite sure what would be considered \"private\" as, essentially, if it's presented to ANYONE to see, provided there is no CDA/NDA, it would be public.  Email is subject to the business position of the hosting site and they can do whatever they want with it, due to EULA and other agreements.\n\nI do hear where you're coming from; I'm just having difficulty finding \"what\" would be private.  \n\nOne of the few things I can think of would be doctor/patient confidentiality agreements that require you to use their e-services.  It would be an invasion of privacy to have anyone view that outside of you and the doctor's office.  This is similar to a court being unable to force a doctor, be it physical or mental, to disclose information about you in court.\n\nThe more I think about trying to classify any sector as private or public, the more I think about the air.  Now follow me here... you have rules and regulations regarding quality of air in your area (city/state/region/etc).  Go somewhere else and they might have different rules and regulations.  There might be an international conference to try to harmonize these laws, but not everyone follows them.\n\nIt's a bit stetched to get this far from the above, but you essentially can claim that this portion is private (area A's) with this set of rules/regulations, and this portion over *here* is public (area B's) with another set of rules/regulations.

Lewis, fenelon, Schopenhauer, Kant and the like. Let's not go back and forth rehashing circular arguments that greater men then us have had for centuries. I have 3 bookcases full of wise words, but the evidence that I see everyday I cannot prove to you no more than I can teach a blind man what the color blue looks like. I don't think I am part of the problem, neither are you. I appreciate when my beliefs are challenged, occasionally I am wrong and rejoice in those times, for my goal is simply to find truth. Unfortunately this is not one of those times as you fail to convince nor do you present anything new or original. I've seen all the debates, I especially like William Lane Craig. Anyways, I'm not part of the problem, see Christian anarchism. You claim that my flawed logic results in poor choices however the evidence in my life says otherwise, and so your claim has no evidence for if through my spiritual path I derive happiness and less suffering then my belief in a god is logical and rational. You have no knowledge of any choices I've made in life and so your logic is flawed. Perhaps mlk jr.,Kepler Descartes Galileo, Boyle, and Einstein had some flawed logic and made poor choices but I don't think solely through their belief in god they were part of whatever problem you are talking about"

"Well one example if you ship a plant to California with soil in it you need to have a cert saying that it has been inspected for nematodes and is free of them.  This is important because the pests listed on these certifications are highly invasive and can cause millions of dollars worth of damage to the Ag industry.  An example of why we require certs is with Asian Citrus Psyllid which spreads a virus called citrus greening.  This disease is rapidly destroying significant chunks of the CA citrus industry and unless something is found to stop it, you will not be able to find CA grown citrus by 2030. \n\nWell if we pull them for having bugs on them then the tests are just to determine if they non native pests for example if I find snails in a box then I would send them to a lab to determine what species they were.  If the lab results come back saying they are C pests (common already in CA) I would release the package, but if it was Q or A (quarantined pests ) I would destroy it.  If I held the package because it lacked certification, the shipper can also request that we send it back to them and we will do so. "

First of all, anecdotal evidence doesn't beat logic, unless you provide a LOT of it, and thus make it a valid sample size.  The second problem is that you aren't considering the logical conclusion of what I've said, which is that you would have done *even more good than you already have* had you had the proper reasoning from which to derive your actions.  You can still be good with bad reasons-- there are plenty of very decent religious people-- but I claim there's a theoretical upper boundary which is created by the fact that you don't actually know what \"good\" is since you have no rational basis of reasoning.\n\n.\n\n&gt; and so your claim has no evidence\n\nMy claim needs no evidence because is based entirely in logic.  (It is logically derived from a basic axiom.)  To disprove it, you'd need to present a logical counter-argument, refute the logic I've laid out, and/or present data which shows that I'm wrong, regardless of the reasoning.\n\n.\n\n&gt; for if through my spiritual path I derive happiness and less suffering then my belief in a god is logical and rational.\n\nWow, there's so much wrong with that.  First of all, the logic of believing in a god is completely separated from ethics.  God may exist and simply be evil.  What is required for believing or not believing in a god, or anything else for that matter, is EVIDENCE AND LOGIC.  The second most egregious thing wrong with that is that you said YOU derive happiness from it (and therefore it's ethical, and therefore your belief in god is rational).  If you were to derive happiness from harming people, that would of course not be ethical.  Ethics concerns all conscious beings, not just you personally.  That's a far second though to the idea that because you are happy being ethical, your belief in god is rational.  That's terrible logic.\n\n.\n\n&gt; You have no knowledge of any choices I've made in life and so your logic is flawed.\n\nIncorrect.  I don't need to know the choices you've made.  The logic of the argument stands on its own.  Read my second part of this post (\"My claim needs...\") for further information.\n\n.\n\n&gt; Perhaps mlk jr.,Kepler Descartes Galileo, Boyle, and Einstein had some flawed logic and made poor choices but I don't think solely through their belief in god they were part of whatever problem you are talking about\n\nAs I have continually said, over and over again, you (and others) can be good-- it's just \"by accident\" since you have no rational basis for figuring out what \"good\" is.  And you set a bad example for the rest of humanity when you have poor reasoning for your choices, because you now have no basis to claim that the poor choices other people make are actually bad.  THAT's the problem with it.  Good as you are, it is probable you would have been *even better* had you had better reasoning for being good."

Well maybe if there was good reason to think there was drugs being smuggled then maybe.\n\nMy mother was a U.S. Customs inspector and she would have never done something like this.

"The documentaries about Australian customs are partially propaganda. While they do have the authority to be rather horrible, they very rarely exercise it off camera. \n\nI've traveled in and out of Australia many times, and have brought in wooden antiques with previous woodworm infestations, clean and untreated wooden objects, food of many kinds, shells, swords with wooden scabbards, animal skins and furs, instruments including goatskin drums and guitars, strawberry seeds, and other declarable items. The only thing ever confiscated was a decorative throwing knife of a kind that needs a form filled in that I had forgotten about, and no fine was issued as I declared it properly. Confiscated items are stored for several weeks to let you sort out paperwork before any measures are taken to dispose of the items. Declaring all declarable items on a form, having documentation in the few cases needed (for antiques, in particular), and being polite to customs as they sift through the first couple of dozen items saves you and them much time and paperwork.\n\nThey almost never fine someone who brings in something they don't realize is not allowed, as when they do there is usually a substantial amount of negative press. The fines are there to use on people actively trying to get things they know to be restricted in without declaring them. If all restricted items are declared, they cannot fine you even if all your items are confiscated.\n\nAll food must be declared, but almost all will be returned after inspection, with the exception of fresh fruit and vegetables, animal products from areas experiencing outbreaks of livestock diseases (including foot and mouth), and foods that have not been properly packaged. Spices need to have been sealed into packaging and labelled properly, as they can be used to conceal myriad banned items, from drugs to seeds of invasive plants. \n\nAll wooden items must be declared, but unless there is visual evidence of infestation, or sourced in an area with current transmissible problems in their wood sources, the items are usually returned without any need for treatment. Items showing signs of current or past infestation need to be certified clean before being allowed through, which is the responsibility of the owner who should know about such damage if they have performed due diligence. There are means available to sterilize delicate items, instruments, and antiques without damage, however it is the responsibility of the owner to avail themselves of these services not the customs officials to inform them of anything more than whether or not the service is sufficient.\n\nThere are ATMs and currency exchange points accessible in the airport. There is also a period of several weeks to sort out confiscated items.\n\nSource: My family has a house in Australia, and my parents' taste in ornaments is similar to that of the British Museum although less kleptomaniacal."

Customs will inspect the item, and let you know if it is ok or needs to be irradiated. If you don't declare the items they will likely get annoyed, but when some pests have the capability to wipe out entire industries and cost billions of dollars then they have the right to make sure you know the rules.\nOnce my parents declared a small wooden toy which had some unsealed wood that customs would not let through - they did not want to pay to be irradiated, and they were even given the option of posting it back overseas if it was properly packaged (it just couldn't come into Australia) But as it was cheap they let it be destroyed.\ntl;dr I am suprised that he was not given options such as irradiation or couriering back overseas, or that customs did not have these options available."

Hell, desktop processors have had 64 bit architecture for several years now, and there are still plenty of programs released as 32 bit x86 only, because it runs on both and is the lowest common denominator.

Kicking me out was their only way to protect the other students—the rich kids who jacked off in my face and stole my stuff. It's not like I learned anything there, anyway.\n\nYou're right about the Internet, but don't forget about the public library and good ol' Sesame Street. That's how I learned."

"Remember that this is more likely when entering a foreign country, than when returning to your own country. \n\nIt's always a good idea to take as little data and as few electronic devices as possible with you across the border. Never take any device with you, with which you've ever accessed questionable websites. Even something in a browser cache can get you in trouble, depending on the jurisdiction. You may have thought you did a good job wiping the device, but then there was something you will have missed. Also, be careful of any kind of private journaling or writing which you're doing while traveling which might cause mistrust if a third party were to read it. Ideally, this kind of stuff should be uploaded to the cloud before you cross the border, and thoroughly purged from your machine.\n\n*Edit: I think I should add that you also ought to always cross at the busiest border crossings/airports you can find. Avoid the quiet ones. That's where they have time to do these types of searches. Don't cross back and forth any more times than absolutely necessary (eg. if you're traveling along the US/Canadian border, don't be tempted by gasoline that is $2 a gallon cheaper on one side of the border); crossing multiple times will raise eyebrows.*"

"Regarding the argument about 'agricultural' items, \\^that's the most sensible argument here.\n\nUnless they're immediately quarantining these items, smashing wood makes no sense at all."
"What are we afraid of again?"
"The customs officials have no way of knowing when and where they were made or if they contained anything harmful.  There are ways to properly deal with importing agricultural products. (http://www.aphis.usda.gov/import_export/)  Researchers do this all the time. \n\nAnd TCD wasn't transferred to Italy with a ship full of lumber.  It was something like a walnut bookend, because someone didn't know what they were doing and didn't pay attention to regulations, or didn't think they applied to them.  \n\nAnd its not just international regulations.  A lot of people aren't aware that you shouldn't transport wood from state to state either (or even sometimes county to county within a state.)  \n\nSo let's use [this](http://www.thousandcankers.com/quarantines.php) site's map.  Let's say you lived in Nebraska, which is a quarantine state for TCD, which means they have restricted the importation of all walnut products into their state.  So, let's then say, that you decide to go on a camping trip to Colorado, adjacent to NB, and a state that has confirmed the presence of TCD.  So, you're camping and you cut or find some firewood.  Maybe you feel like you're doing a good thing cleaning up your area and throw some pieces of wood in the back of your truck.  Or maybe you find a twig you think looks cool.  However it happens, you take some of that wood from CO back to NB with you, and now, maybe, you've spread TCD to the walnut population of Nebraska.\n\nMaybe that doesn't mean a whole lot to you, but it does to a lot of other people.  Just because you don't understand or agree with a law doesn't mean there isn't a good reason for it.\n\nAlso: http://www.dontmovefirewood.org/"

That includes staying drug free. You can't get a job while on drugs.  \n\nMaking politicians who have had jobs careers, went to school bettering themselves, AND passed drug tests getting to the positions where they hold now.  Even trying to compare that to someone on welfare is just asinine. \n\nIf the abuse wasn't so wide spread, tho wouldn't be an issue.  One of the ways to rein this in, drug tests. \n\n"

"I wouldn't limit the price so much as cap the price that can be charged while retaining IP protection.  \n\nThe cap should be calculated on the basis of costs of production, proven research/development/testing costs, and with the limited market (for the treatment) factored in for treatments that are only useful for rare or obscure ailments.\n\nIt would introduce a market that would only attract competitors if there is price gouging.  Ideally a company would factor the risk of introducing competitors for itself into its pricing decisions (companies would avoid price gouging so as to avoid triggering competition in the market for that treatment).  Because the price cap rises with higher R&amp;D, higher production costs, and the rarity of customers, it shouldn't disadvantage any company that is charging reasonable prices based on these factors."

"I can see where this thread is going to steam roll into. But let me make one thing clear.\n\nUS Ports of entry are not \"Constitution Free Zones\". There is a limited exception to the 4th amendment when it comes to the search of people and goods entering the country. This has always been the case since the founding of the republic. The US Customs Service was founded by the fifth act of Congress in 1789. It was the first federal law enforcement agency created. The founding fathers who wrote the fourth amendment are the same men who created the Customs Service and empowered it to search goods at the border. It is pretty clear they did not consider a border search to be unreasonable.\n\nLet me state that again to be clear. The border search exception is as old as the 4th amendment.\n\nThese searches went on without significant challenge until Boyd v US in 1886 when the supreme court specifically addressed the issue and reaffirmed the exception. Since then almost every time the issue has reached the court they have ruled in the governments favor. The only real restrictions involve body cavity searches.\n\nAfter 9/11 people somehow got it in their head that border searches are the result of the Patriot Act or some shadowy DHS initiative. It just isn't true.\n"

I can take a report and refer him to the Juvenile Court for being incorrigible.  \n\nBut those are all short term solutions.  If the parent doesn't implement a long term strategy, then there's a cycle where we just get called over and over again to impose consequences as the kid continues to be out of control.\n\nAnd there are plenty of ways that a parent can discipline without being physical, so DFS doesn't enter into it at all.  If the kid is that out of control, DFS will be a much better agency to help the parent (in the long term) than the police will anyway.\n\n&gt; You signed up for this, I didn't.

"I'm fairly pinko in my political leanings and I agree with you wholeheartedly.  MSNBC is every bit as cringe inducing as FOX news.  I've pretty much given up on tv news any more and get most of my news from a combination of NPR and reddit/internet. It's still not perfect, but at least NPR seems to be pretty balanced and on the internet I can dig to try and get both sides of an issue.  It would be nice to have a tv network of unbiased fact based news, as CNN started off trying to be, but taking out the bias seems to be pretty much impossible (and over the past decade, CNN seems to run by a big bunch idiots).  \n\nMy boyfriend tends to the right, and to settle political arguments we have a rule that you have to find evidence to back up any claims made that the other objects to.  As a consequence, I think I tend to be more willing to see both sides of an issue and not blindly eat up the bull shit that is put out by liberals wholesale.  This isn't to say that conservatives don't have the same bull shit spewers -- of course they do -- but I have noticed that it is common to criticize others for doing the same thing you do.  Many of my liberal friends jump on every bad thing done or said by any conservative ever, but when liberals are criticized, even legitimately, it's suddenly slurs and lies spread by the evil right wing bullies.\n\nIt's enough to drive a reasonable person nuts."

"The original plaintiff did not have standing because his complaint was not about the search/seizure. Original plaintiff's complaint was to \"seek expungement of information\" that the DHS may have, which he was entitled to under current regulation. There was no need to seek relief through the courts.\n\nThe judge also says he has standing if he added the search/seizure as part of his complaint. But it wasn't added. He could add it if he wanted to and it would give him standing. The judge is more rational than what the article makes it sound.\n\n[The case decision.](https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/assets/abidor_decision.pdf) The stuff about Abidor's standing is around page 19-20."

"Well one difference I will always remember is flying into Charles De Gaulle airport, showing my non-EU passport and then walking right out. That was it and it was 2013. It took about 5 minutes from collecting my luggage. That is what flying in continental Europe is like.\n\nComparing to say my experience of LAX, jack booted thugs walk around that look like the criminals they should be stopping. After showing my passport three times I get to line up to take the fingerprint machine, the surface is covered in grime and I would have rather touched a public toilet bowl. I ask for a wipe to clean it but the person behind the counter shakes their head. Put my fingers to the machine and surprise surprise it doesn't read correctly. Ten armed guards circle around me and take me to a holding cell. After an hour I am interrogated about why I came to the US, to be honest at this point I didn't know myself and almost asked to be deported. After an interrogation that consisted mostly of asking me the same questions over and over I was allowed to walk out to an area to get my bags thoroughly searched. This was about 5 years ago and I've heard it's gotten worse. Not knocking Americans as a people but I won't be coming back.\n\nI do have an EU passport but before that I traveled under an Australian passport and it was pretty easy. "

"As a white male traveler with a large beard and ponytail I am often pulled aside. I have traveled between America and Canada and all but once have been \"randomly\" searches, swabbed, and patted. I have sat 3 hours in a cell in Canada and 2 in America. I do not hold resentments against the agents. They were simply doing their job. \n\nIn America they did not let you use a cell phone, though they never took it off my person. I had to turn on my laptop to prove it was a functioning machine. This was because they thought I was a drug mule (again based on my appearance). They searched through all my belongings and haphazardly tosses them back in. \n\nIn Canada they thought I was coming to work illegally (really was visiting my now fiancée/common law partner). They searched all my clothes and folded them back in. My phone was taken and looked through, my laptop I had to login to all my email addresses for them to comb through. My parents were called, my grandparents called and the calls were like interrogations I found out later with the agent just yelling \"where is he working\" over and over and not taking the answer of \"he's not, he is there to see a woman\". \n\nI do not mind these searches, it is their job to find and weed out drugs and people trying to cross illegally. But it should be rather easy to quickly identify the 27 year old in front of you is doing everything legal and let them go. Right now I am in an airport going home to my lover and fully expect to be pulled aside, it is not weird for me- it has become the norm. "

It's a shame for America and the full effect will start to be felt this year. The one area that the USA could innovate and rebuild the economy for the next 50 years their own government is single handedly dismantling bit by bit. \n\nSource: I consulted with a Canadian government department that is undergoing a total shift in software that states specifically no USA based software ever and cited patriot act and us surveillance. The good part for Canadians is that if equivalent software is not available they are commissioning developers to rebuild it on their own. As soon as this software was developed it was available to other departments in other countries. This is one small department and represents millions of dollars alone. Imagine that on a worldwide scale. It bodes really poorly for the future of the economy and competition in USA. YOU WONT EVEN BE INVITED TO THE PURCHASING ROOM TABLE AFTER 2014.

The other south of the Equator with one third of the worlds land mass, where the seasons are the exact opposite phase  of those in the northern hemisphere. \n\nSo whilst parts of the US suffer low temperature conditions.

"From [the article](http://www.snopes.com/politics/quotes/barbara.asp)\n&gt; Read within the context of the full interview, it is a tiny bit more clear that Mrs. Bush's \"beautiful mind\" statement referred to her desire not to become mesmerized by the pre-war media speculation of what such an invasion would mean, what sorts of weaponry and defenses U.S. troops might well be walking into, which troops would be committed and when they'd be deployed, how long the war would last, and how high the body count might be. Prior to the commencement of hostilities, such matters were the subject of endless supposition by various news pundits. While maybe not \"90 percent\" of what was filling the air waves was guesswork rather than hard news, Mrs. Bush's point that news of that moment was much more about what could or might happen rather than what washappening was valid. Her comment was not meant as a dismissal of actual deaths or suffering (troops had not yet been engaged at the time of her remark), but of news coverage that amounted to one expert after another making predictions about what they saw as likely to occur."

"The idea that full border powers are extended through that area is an exaggeration and the case you cited is the prime example of how it actually works.  In that case, the supreme court ruled that \"administrative searches\" could be made, which allows for vehicles to be stopped and the occupants to be checked for citizenship or immigration status.  \n\nThe important thing to note is that if the officers turn up probable cause for a more thorough search during that stop, then they of course can conduct one. In Almeida-Sanchez, it was undisputed that the agents had no cause or warrant.  So the more thorough search was illegal and the evidence was tossed out.\n\nBut, if you were out of the border zone, they still wouldn't be able to conduct a legal search because the initial stop would have been without cause since they can't just stop you randomly to check immigration status outside of that zone.\n\nEdits: autocorrect"

If we were to cease all CO2 production RIGHT now, it would have no effect on the climate in 2100 as the Earth's climate does not function on short time scales measured in just decades.\n\nIt is quite possible that the warming we are seeing now is a result of what began in the 1800s with the industrial revolution (in which case the CO2 from the 20th century will make things really bad the further in time you go)."

He called that money his \"weed dough\" and lived off cash he made working under the table on construction jobs. He once used his food stamps to buy food for a Super Bowl party he hosted, and bragged about it.\n\nObviously those are just two examples, and are not a representative sample size to pass any judgment on everyone as a whole, but if I know of 2 such cases in my small corner of life ... logic would dictate that there are many more similar cases out there.\n\nI do think something needs to be done, what that is ...

Not a quiet, humane needle but hauled to a hectic auction, loaded up on slaughter trucks and sent far off to be butchered. After horse slaughter was banned in the US (another knee jerk 'humane' ban) unwanted horses were sent to Mexico. There, they suffered horrible beatings and treatment before being killed. If the carriage companies could work out a decent adoption or retirement plan, or even humane euthanasia for these horses, their work as a carriage horse wouldn't offend so many.

I took my one required architecture course (in which we focussed on MIPS) and haven't really looked back, as I have no real need to.

"This doesn't bother me, and it probably shouldn't bother you.\n\nThe government has for a very long time had the ability to wiretap your phone, bug your house, and monitor your computer if they suspect you of a crime (in the case of law enforcement) or suspect your of being a terrorist/spy (in the case of the CIA/NSA). There are are decent (if not perfect) safeguards on this. Not to mention the built-in safeguard that doing so is a lot of work.\n\nGetting a warrant (or a court order, even a bogus one), intercepting a package, manually getting some NSA IT guy to unpack it, install whatever spyware is needed, repacking everything, and sealing everything so well that it looks unopened, and getting it back on its way without being detected isn't exactly a small effort. This scary thing about the recent scandals isn't that the NSA could spy on you if they really wanted to. Or that they had good spyware. Of course the NSA has good spyware, that is literally their job.\n\nThe scary things about the recent scandals was that they were doing this on everyone. They were tapping into the Google, email, and whatnot, and just making a copy of everything. Regardless of whether they suspected you of anything. And then just keyword scanning it, as well as saving it for later in case they later changed their mind.\n\nIn essence, they were literally spying on everyone. Even US citizens, who they supposedly aren't allowed to spy on.\n\nNo one, not even the NSA can't be intercepting billions of packages, so that is not what I fear. Yes, the system will be abused and there will be cases from time to time where we will have fight back in the courts. But those fights have been happening for hundreds of years. What I fear is that the technology exists where billions (or even trillions) of messages can be intercepted with virtually no incremental effort on the part of the NSA. Which could literally lead to a \"big brother\" society. (If it hasn't already.)\n\n**TL;DR: Intercepting a laptop and installing spyware isn't that different than a wiretap. Yes, it will happen. Yes, it will be abused. But it's too labor intensive to be cause a real problem. Worry instead about the fact that your internet connection can be monitored extensively, even if they don't install spyware on your laptop.**"

"&gt;It is well established that certain constitutional protections available to persons inside the United States are unavailable to aliens outside of our geographic borders. See United States v. VerdugoUrquidez, 494 U. S. 259, 269 (1990) (Fifth Amendment's protections do not extend to aliens outside the territorial boundaries); Johnson v. Eisentrager, 339 U. S. 763, 784 (1950) (same). But once an alien enters the country, the legal circumstance changes, for the Due Process Clause applies to all \"persons\" within the United States, including aliens, whether their presence here is lawful, unlawful, temporary, or permanent. See Plyler v. Doe, 457 U. S. 202, 210 (1982); Mathews v. Diaz, 426 U. S. 67, 77 (1976); Kwong Hai Chew v. Colding, 344 U. S. 590, 596-598, and n. 5 (1953); Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.

Mezei, supra, at 212 (\"[A]liens who have once passed through our gates, even illegally, may be expelled only after proceedings conforming to traditional standards of fairness encompassed in due process of law\"). Indeed, this Court has held that the Due Process 694*694 Clause protects an alien subject to a final order of deportation, see Wong Wing v. United States, 163 U. S. 228, 238 (1896), though the nature of that protection may vary depending upon status and circumstance, see Landon v. Plasencia, 459 U. S. 21, 32-34 (1982); Johnson, supra, at 770.\n\nZadvydas v.

If you learn the theory, and   implementation using one specific language as an example, picking up additional languages is simple. Recursion, data structures, etc., are the same, even if the syntax is slightly different.\n\nPart of why the iphone 5s is able to come close to the performance of the Nexus 5, when the nexus' processor is so much more powerful has to do with optimization. Its the same way game consoles have been able to come close to the performance of PC's (at least early in the life of each generation) with a fraction of the power, due to hardware being standardized and therefore programmers being able to optimize code. iOS only has to work on the small handful of hardwares that Apple makes. Android has to work on countless devices made by many manufacturers. \n\nWhile that ability to optimize is great for apple, and in a lot of ways makes iOS development easier than Android, but their closed nature and restrictive policies are terrible for both developers and consumers."

"&gt; I'm not sure that's true, either practically or historically. The Declaration of Independence says \"that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights\", which would suggest that the constitutions' protections--written by a largely similar group of people recognized existing rights rather than creating new ones.\n\nAbsolutely. That's all the US Constitution does - guarantee *protection* of rights that already exist. The right to bear arms, for example - the 2nd Amendment - is a human right. You have it whether the law says so or not, because people will appropriate anything and everything available to them when they are threatened in an attempt to defend themselves and survive.\n\nThe 2A simply codifies that this existent right will not be infringed by governmental process, whether legislated or otherwise.\n\nIt's the same for the rest of the Bill of Rights. The Rights exist independently of the US - they were there before and will be there after. The Constitution defines how the government must interact with them.\n\nNote: This is all \"on paper\". As we've seen many examples of recently, certain governmental bodies have NO problem sidestepping these items in many situations. Hence the difference between the letter of the law and practical application."

What the value of a dollar actually *is* is determined on foreign exchange markets. That's the entire point of a floating currency.

Ten minutes at healthcare.gov or googling the \"Affordable Healthcare Act\" reveals provisions of the new laws which address my claims and discredit your naive fearmongering.\n\nThe fact is, the ACA is far from perfect, but it's a step in the right direction.  I don't think anybody is 100% pleased with it, but there are many key components of the legislation, not the least of which is the eradication of \"pre-existing conditions\" which unequivocably provides access to healthcare for many people who could otherwise not get it -- and this isn't argued by anyone on either ideological side.

Up until the 1960s, paper currency like a banknote was just a proxy for a physical quantity of silver (and until 1934, a physical quantity of gold). The bearer of a banknote could present the note and receive a corresponding physical quantity of precious metal; the paper itself was simply the promise that such quantity would be provided. Since that reciprocity was abolished, the value of a banknote is no longer tied to a real world, measurable quantity as it used to be."

"Let's put it this way - if you have the time (or money if you prefer not to spend your time) to improve the situation of a person or a horse, I feel that time should be spent on people. The Declaration of Independence says that all human beings have the unalienable rights of \"Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\" When the homeless finally have these rights (through a place to live, etc), then lets look at horses, etc. It is not as simple as the mayor saying \"Stop Doing that.' The Constitution says that you can't take someone's property without just compensation. If you regulate away someone's livelihood, it is arguably a taking. If there are lawsuits, the money spent defending will be money that could have been spent productively. To say we can do both (50% of our time/money on humans versus 50% of our time/money on horses) means that some people will get less while some horses get more. I don't see how this is justifiable. The simple fact that you are taking your time to argue in favor of animals is time that should have been spent arguing in favor of humans. I know that horses and other animals are much cuter and garner more sympathy than the homeless. However, this is all the more reason to help the homeless. Let me put it another way - there is a big car accident in front of you and the car is one fire. Inside the car is an unconscious person and an unconscious dog. Who do you pull out first? Now lets say its 1,000 unconscious people versus 1,000 unconscious dogs getting radiation poisoning from a nearby nuclear explosion. Do you save the 1,000 people first, or whoever is closest, whether dogs or people, knowing that you only have time to save 1,000. Basically, what kind of society do we live in where the plight of animals gets more attention than the plight of people? Seriously, who do you think suffers more in a day - a homeless teen or a horse pulling a carriage? These kids want a roof over their heads - we don't even know what the horses want. Meanwhile, these kids will stay homeless and the horses will get all the attention.  "

A sucker bet.\n\n&gt; That drop in gold and silver we saw last year is all bullshit because those markets aren't determined by supply and demand.\n\nGold doesn't have any demand.

"I think many folks are falling in a dual-extreme fallacy.  There's two things to be reasoned here. \n\n1. is that 'information' should be treated differently from 'physical objects'.

If the object that carries such information is lawful, then border-control/tsa shouldn't be allowed to 'touch' the information contained with it!\n\n2. There are however some cases where we can see that checking such data should be viable and useful for security and law enforcement. Simply stating that the gov should be able to search all or search nothing  misses the point. They should be able to do it **within a lawful process where your rights are weighted in!!**  \nif the border/tsa/FBI believes that you're carrying some national security threatening information/industrial spionage or some other dangerous information then they should be able to inform you and your lawyer of it, confiscate your laptop and **without \"touching\" it** ask for a warrant to search its contents. Until then such device and its information should be left alone and they should clearly say what they are searching for and what it 'looks like'. The same reasonable criteria you have when a warrant to search a house is issued.  \n\nthe thing here is that the current course of actions just means that there is a bunch of dumb gorilas guarding the borders and they have the right to search everything and confiscate anything, no questions asked/explanations given.\n\nand yes, as a foreigner, my will to ever visit the US has decreased immensely in the last couple of years."

"Well, first off, I'll apologize if my tone with that other fellow offended you. Now, lets get to your points. Your one and only point was that they are different because one is doing a job, and the other needs help. So, in your eyes, someone who is 'doing a job' doesn't have to be sober? As a tax-payer, I personally would feel much better if ALL our politicians were subjected to drug and alcohol screening. I, unlike you apparently, DO care about how they perform the jobs they were elected to do. Now you say it's fair and right to spend money drug testing these people because they shouldn't use that money for luxuries! I do agree with you. I don't, however, think that drug testing these people is in any way going to solve this problem in the slightest. After all, you're starting off with a grand assumption that there is some plague of abuse here, and that most of the people on welfare are using it for drugs. This is beyond ridiculous. If you have proof of this, then by all means, submit it from a reliable source. Also, where do you draw the line with 'luxuries?' Does that food have too much sugar? Luxury! Does it have a bit too much flavor? LUXURY! Give me a break. In your mind, spending a large amount of money...in order to save a much smaller amount of money...makes sense? You must be a fiscal conservative.\nNow you're second assumption (you're full of those, are you?); I am far from being a 'liberal.' Do I lean left, of course. But I am a centrist \nthrough and through, thus I'd love for it to be mandatory for all politicians to have to submit to testing like this."

I went to the dollar store and bought him $2 of mini candy canes to replace the big ones. Unlike animals, humans help each other. When humans don't need anymore help, then lets look at the animals.

"First off an animal that can no longer pull carriages all day long could certainly be very useful on a smaller farm like mine. They can be retrained to ride since there is a big difference between pulling a cart with usually 3 people in it and having a single rider. Also even if they are not fit to ride by a full sized adult they can be companion animals for younger horses or be excellent first horses for a child rider. They are what we call bombproof in that they don't spook and are very patient. Also there are varying degrees of physical problems in horses, some horses not fit to carry a wagon anymore are not in constant pain they just don't have the ability to lug around that much weight for that long of a time. \n\nAs to there not being a financial gain for the cart owner to allow it to be adopted vs. selling it for dog food. I have seen full grown healthy horses be bought at auctions for $40 so the monetary gain isn't always a huge one. And the horses aren't always physically unfit. It's just that the bottom fell out of the horse market, the price of hay, feed, and gas went up. It's sometimes just easier for people to make a fast buck than to wait around to try to find a good owner. Something that might help is a write off on their taxes for animals that are adopted out instead of slaughtered. Something like $100 write off for the animal would be probably more than they would have gotten per pound from a dog food company. It would also encourage them to do the more humane thing. \n\nIf they are in constant pain however, I have no problem with having them euthanized. Even if that euthanization occurs at a slaughterhouse, but there isn't anything humane about being loaded onto trailers sometimes standing in their own filth for days on end. It's over 2,000 miles just straight from NY to Monterrey Mexico which is I believe closer than most processing facilities. They cram in as many as they can to save money often making stops along the way at different auctions. During all this time for transport they don't take the animals out and allow them to move around. I've heard some don't even feed or water them. But for arguments sake lets say they filled their trailers completely in one stop in NY then that's still at least 36 hours of straight road time, not including stops for the drivers to sleep, eat, and crap. They arrive to facilities with little to no oversight into how they are treated so it doesn't surprise me that there is abuse. I feel we need to allow the processing plants here to reopen at least there was some oversight into the treatment of the animals in those plants. "

The daily feed bill for one horse of this size is ~$10/day. Each horse needs 2 acres to just live On. one horses vet care for a year is about 1,000$. A horse also needs their hooves (feet) taken care of every 6-8 weeks which on the east coast is 100$ for basic care, and big horses like these generally need shoes (60$/hoof). \n\nA rescue can look good on paper, but NYCLASS has never had to take care and get living situations for large amounts of horses.

"How about the fact that the paper that I am given is in exchange for my labors or goods? Or that it is accepted worldwide?\n\nWatch what happens to the willingness of organizations to accept bitcoin as payment when the bubble bursts.\n\nSome companies accept btc as payment because they believe in it as an alternative currency. They cherish the ideal of being free from government control, and like what it represents.\n\nOthers trust that it will appreciate. It's an investment for them to trade the dollars that they would get for btc to increase their investment.\n\nMuch of bitcoin's utility is found in illegal or purely speculative activity. A currency that appreciates in value is useless, as it is to your benefit to hold onto it as it increases in value rather than spending it. If you don't spend it, it's not a currency; it's a commodity."

"Our family go to Chattanooga fairly often and we'll hop on the horse drawn carriages from time to time. We talk with the drivers and they're usually pretty happy to talk about the horses. The horses are transported from a farm and apparently have a fairly reasonable work schedule. When working, their days are long, 8-10 hours, but they are given breaks throughout the day. As for the actual pulling, they said that even a fully laden carriage isn't hard to pull, especially on a flat paved road with those narrow wheels. One driver commented that even an human adult could pull it. If you've seen those strongman tricks with guys pulling a bus or a plane, you would understand how much easier a carriage might be. \n\nWe never got the impression the horses were abused in any way.

The reason a bicycle has a lower footprint than a car is not that humans are more efficient than internal combustion engines, but that a cyclist on a bike weighs about 1/20th of a driver and car, has a smaller cross-section and can't go as fast."

"I’m going to ignore the straw man quality of your argument. Ethically, yes, the majority opinion now is that they were wrong. That’s the nature of society: it changes. However, people can reach different logical conclusions to the same situation depending upon their own assumptions about what is important and what is not.\n\nBut let’s set that to the side because that distracts from the point I’ve been driving at: that time does not automatically discredit arguments by virtue of its linear progression. For example, Socrates’ argument regarding divinely-commanded morality in Euthyphro is as cogent and applicable today as it was when Plato wrote down the words. A more relatable example: the logical basis for private property, the social contract and tacit consent. They were all made centuries ago, but they are still valid logical arguments that form the basis for our modern system of laws and governance. Time doesn’t disqualify their validity. The laws on our books are merely a form of those logical arguments, as written and understood by those who make our laws."

Much of the city's infrastructure more pressing than potholes was crumbling, corruption was rife, crime was rampant. Any one of those issues were more pressing than potholes. But she sent out those pothole patrols and the goodwill she reaped almost *immediately* from the popular feedback put her in a much stronger position politically and allowed her to fight back against the inertia of a fractured and squabbling city council.\n\nI won't be as naive to say that the pothole patrols made her mayorship, but working up a string of small successes building up to a major issue is sort of a political playbook utilized everywhere."

"Don't know about Little Indias but the various larger Chinatowns of the US didn't always use to be \"economically prosperous\"; when they were first established, they were usually hives of poverty and overpopulation, where the informal economy (to put it kindly) thrived. \n\nBut the Chinese have been in the US for a very long time, which also helps new immigrants find their way in better, whereas Somali immigration is relatively new. Also, I would guess/imagine, Chinese immigrants coming in nowadays would usually come in on study or work visa that are often reserved to the higher educated/trained, whereas I suppose Somali immigrants are often refugees. And of course the Somalian state and society have been in such a state of disarray and disintegration for so long that people who come from there will lack a lot of background that modern middle-class Chinese immigrants have, and come with a lot of trauma and problems that modern Chinese immigrants don't have.\n\nBut yeah, the original Chinatowns, from the late-19th to the mid-20th century, were volatile places where crime syndicates and gangs held a lot of sway too, and poverty was high."

"I would like to see the commonly used logic applied to the argument. It would get around the current state of misleading buzz words being used to pass legislation. Do you think the plaintiff will argue for more or less scrutiny? And why wont the courts or the government on any level look at that fact that heavy firearms laws do not correlate with fewer gun crimes or deaths in the areas that have the most laws. When you really look at gun crimes nationwide the vast majority comes from small inner city areas. We also need to stop counting suicides in gun deaths. Firearm laws are not going to do a thing to stop it. Why are we not applying heavy scrutiny to the common truths of gun control. \n\nIts just ridiculous to me that we give these mystical powers to firearms when a bad person does something heinous, yet we do not go around regulating cars when a drunk driver kills someone.  \n\nI do not see why flash suppressors are so hated lol. I mean realistically were talking about a feature that in the civilian realm keeps you from going blind if you shoot in low light. A feature such as that I think should be looked at as a common sense type of feature, much like suppressors are in Europe. I do not know why anyone argues for grenade launchers either. The whole thing just gives the gun control side fuel to say see these gun nuts want to be able to shoot grenades! Bayonet lugs do not really need to be on modern sporting rifles. We are not going to at risk of being overrun. On the other hand I am gonna be really pissed if I have to saw the lug off my immaculate WWII M1 Garand!! "

"I haven't seen many people, even those who don't believe in climate change, argue against cleaner technology. The main disagreement is raising the price of \"dirty technology\" that is currently available to encourage a market change. It is actually very logical, raising the price on gasoline through taxation simply hurts the low-income commuters who have no access to public transit while the rich and much of the middle class can afford to move closer to public transit or buy the new technology. The cheering that comes from many environmentalists when gasoline goes up really does not win them any friends, because gas raising raises prices of goods so even those who aren't driving are affected.  \n\nFor reference, I am not a climate change denier, but my mother is and nothing will change that. However, the minute LED light bulbs became affordable, we got them, she even paid for them, once solar panels become affordable, we'll have them, the minute that cars that don't produce emission become affordable, we will get them. For now, that's not the case. Technology will catch up within 50 years, but it's just not possible to produce an emission-free car for the masses right now, allegedly there's not even enough material for this, the rare earth mineral problem may make matters even more complicated.

Please tell, me was it expense,revenue, or profit. Do you not agree that all companies (including yous) have this. Your business also has absolutely nothing to do with this, anyone can start a sole/joint proprietorship and not run it to the ground, a corporation is simple enough but on this scale something completely different.\n\nYou don't agree with me and you won't, but please at least take a basic microeconomics course and accounting course. If you already have even if you've taken multiple courses in this area take them again somewhere else because you don't seem to understand even the simplest of concepts.  Again \"labor\" is included in profit, profit is not revenue, from this statement I can tell you have not taken a single course in the business area, and yet you're arrogant enough to use words you do not know the meaning of and then get angry when someone corrects you on them.  Also look at the comments that responded to you and are agreement with mine. \n\nTotal revenue - total expenses (labor is already in there, look up what an expense is) = profit or loss."

For September, these drug-related denials were an astounding 35 percent of all otherwise eligible applicants, as shown in Table 1 on page 3\n\nWhen was the \"first quarter\" before September 2011?

Most people are leaving the bags outside their door kinda hoping they will be picked up - and mostly they have been, right now it´s  just an \"extra trime\" strike, so it s a lot better.\n\nBut they pick their strike dates very judiciously - in the past year they have gone on strike over Christmas (lots of garbage) and over St Anthony´s day in June which is the city holiday and a night of many parties and lots of garbage.

"Why do people think working animals will have a better life not doing anything?   The only reason these horses exist is to pull these carts.  They won't be pets, you can't turn them loose to run free.  It costs money to take care of horses and we saw what happened with the horse industry during the recession.  People lost their homes or couldn't afford to take care of them.  Due to the drought hay prices skyrocketed increasing the costs for feed.  Since we also had a ban on horse processing, the horses had zero value to anyone so they either starved or were turned loose in rural areas.  Rescue organizations were flooded with animals and they ended up destroying 100's of horses.  See http://www.amillionhorses.com/ for more info or just search google for abandoned horses."

Did it drop 48% and then never return to previous levels which suggests that the drug users simply stayed away? \n\nMy point is that simply looking at the failure rate as a measurement of success of the program is wrong. Because all that statistic tells you is the number of welfare recipients stupid enough to do drugs *and* apply for welfare. It does not tell you the number of welfare recipients who did or were doing drugs and were smart enough to not bother applying. The complete picture is needed to judge the success of the program. "

The ACA didnt mandate that all current policies must be cancelled and everyone must register again. If it states that, source it and Ill concede my point on this.\n\nI am simply trying to say that while the ACA changed some things, like requiring insurance companies to not turn down people with diseases and whatnot, the ACA did not force them to cancel you. The company cancelled you because now the company has to insure people that it could say no to prior. That and the company saw an opportunity to take more money as well. There are plenty of exemptions(one being that if the policy isnt affordable, you dont have to get it, with affordable defined as 9.5% of your monthly income)\n\n&gt;no reason to screw us all, including themselves out of a profitable long term relationship.\n\nThey saw how they could gain more of a profit. Simple as that. I am exempt from the requirement on multiple levels($120 is more than 9.5% of my current income, and I have healthcare through the VA, etc.)\n\ntl;dr The ACA did not force the insurance company to screw everyone over. Those decisions were made by the company. The policies cost more because now everyone has to be allowed to purchase the policy, and maybe some additional profit. "

Edibles are commonly $10.  Travel a bit though, and I can find the same prices here: some of the places charge $35/gram.  People pay that here for the usual reasons, like being able to say \"I got this at [insert name of fru-fru boutique weed store, with clowns and mimes entertaining customers in the pretentiously hippy-esque lounge, here].\n\nI'm very curious about what happens to prices in CO over the next few years; theoretically they should drop considerably.

"This is true. But as I said, I think the main problem with their act wasn't the simple fact that they killed animals. The main problem was that they killed the animals of someone else, which is vandalism. If the owner of the lambs chose to kill those lambs with a cinder block, instead of the traditional way of draining their blood, that would be a different story, but it would still be somewhat questionable, because it isn't practical at all. I have eaten lamb brain, and it's nice, but if you cause cerebral hemorrhage, that ruins it. This makes execution by cinder block wasteful. I don't think it's animal cruelty, because that lamb will die either way, and I don't think being bled out is any more pleasurable than getting knocked out with a blunt object.\n\nSociety considers some pleasures acceptable, and some not acceptable. Killing animals for food is considered acceptable, but pointlessly causing them suffering isn't. Get over it."

I don't think anyone from the area read this and thought 'oh, hate crime' because that would be extremely unusual. But I think it would be unusual because those kind of actions in general are very uncommon for the area, there is already too much of an established somalian population for anybody to think setting fire to a building would 'drive them out', and because it's cold as shit.

"I can chime in to add some clarity. I work with HolacracyOne, the company behind Holacracy. Your insights about how the system works are correct - kudos to you for looking into it and *not* rely on the news article :) \n\nHolacracy is not a \"flat structure\" at all, nor an \"everybody is equal\" kind of deal. However it is manager-less. In a way, it is also true that there is no hierarchy in the sense that there is no hierarchy of people. Instead, there is a holarchy (which is a type a hierarchy) of circles (i.e. teams) and roles. Unlike job descriptions, roles are defined according to the work, not according to the people available. People can fill several roles, even in different circles. \n\nSo although it's true that there is a holarchy of circles and roles, it doesn't map one-to-one to a hierarchy of people. You can see an example with HolacracyOne's structure here: https://glassfrog.holacracy.org/organizations/5\n\nEach circle is self-organizing and autonomous. If you click on a circle's details in the link above (e.g. Holacracy Deployment), you can see that it has a Purpose and Accountabilities. These elements are defined by the higher circle (e.g. GCC), and then the circle organizes as it sees fit to best express this purpose and these accountabilities. No role from the higher circle can come mess with it and tell it how to do its job (they can, however, propose modifying its purpose and its accountabilities). \n\nIt's challenging to explain Holacracy without any sort of framing, so I hope what I'm writing is making some sense! We give an introductory webinar on Jan 9, if you're ever interested in getting a big picture overview: http://holacracy.org/events\n\nOlivier"

"From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Assault_Weapons_Ban#Efforts_to_renew_the_ban):\n\n&gt; Shortly after the November 4, 2008 election, Change.gov, the website of the office of then President-elect Barack Obama, listed a detailed agenda for the forthcoming administration. The stated positions included \"making the expired federal Assault Weapons Ban permanent.\" This statement was originally published on Barack Obama's campaign website, BarackObama.com. The agenda statement later appeared on the administration's website, WhiteHouse.gov, with its wording intact.\n\n&gt; On February 25, 2009 newly sworn-in Attorney General Eric Holder repeated the Obama administration's desire to reinstate the federal assault weapons ban. The mention came in response to a question during a joint press conference with DEA Acting Administrator Michele Leonhart, discussing efforts to crack down on Mexican drug cartels. Attorney General Holder said: \"... there are just a few gun-related changes that we would like to make, and among them would be to reinstitute the ban on the sale of assault weapons.\"\n\n&gt; Senator Dianne Feinstein introduced a federal assault weapons ban bill in the U.S. Senate following the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. The bill had a provision to eliminate the sunset clause which was part of the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban, and would have been directed at firearms with detachable magazines and at least one single military feature. The GOP Congressional delegation from the State of Texas condemned Sen. Feinstein's bill, along with the NRA. On March 14, 2013, the Senate Judiciary Committee approved a version of the bill along party lines. On April 17, 2013, the Senate voted 60 to 40 against reinstating the federal assault weapons ban."

"Sorry man, but I lived this and it's all true.  I live in rural Oklahoma and saw this occur regularly over the past several years both first hand and in the media.  In high school I worked at a horse auction every weekend and own several horses myself.  Since the ban on slaughter, this auction has been shut down.  My wife and I have taken in unwanted and foundered horses at great expense.  My state also banned the sale of horses for slaughter.  Our governor just passed a bill allowing this again and we should see the value of these animals increase and a decrease in the amount of abused and starved animals.

(no riders)  \n\nAll bills and laws must have a SIMPLE summary. ( no more 2000 page laws that require a law degree to parse)\n\nAll Campaign funds should to go into a central account that is divided evenly between candidates. ( helps prevent unbalanced smear campaigns and buying the media )\n\nMajor media needs to be required to offer equal time. ( If you sell 5 minutes per hour of advertising to candidate #1, Candidate #2 needs to have the option to buy the same amount of time at the same price.)  \n\nAlternately, the district needs to pay for the advertising time on behalf of all candidates out of the common campaign fund. \n\nCampaign promises should be treated as a contract. ( Politician lies to get into office? He can be sued out of office as well as having charges/class action brought against him.)\n\n\nThose changes would allow for voters to ACTUALLY vote for their best candidate instead of being offered an illusion of only 2 choices.\n\nSadly, the politicians are in a self managing position which allows them to easily prevent these changes from ever being implemented.

"Aren't the bulk majority of the muggings in the Marcy-Holmes neighborhood? Which is on east bank. Other than the Carlson and Anderson robberies, I can't think of any of the recent crimes that have been there. and both of those happened in the middle of the day, so I don't know why you would think not walking around at night would matter. \n\nAnd honestly, it's a couple of college kids getting their phone and laptops stolen. If I was a criminal I'd also go to a place where the majority of people are walking around with a few hundred dollars of electronics on them at all times. The only times it's every gotten to be actually physical are the sexual assaults which both happened in Marcy, and that one kid who got knocked unconscious but that was 100% on east bank.\n\nWe live in a city. Yeah, people are going to get mugged. Particularly considering the fact that we are the PRIME people to rob. Compared to other cities (particularly Detroit and Chicago!), this is an unusually safe and clean city. I think there's what, 30 armed muggings of U of M students this semester. That's 7.5 a month. 7.5 out of THOUSANDS and THOUSANDS of people. That's a very low percentage.\n\nSource: another U of M student who thinks that, while I'm glad they're doing something to reduce crime, it's ridiculous to even imply that the area is a ghetto or a high crime area especially when the person brought up places like Detroit and Chicago.\n\nI wouldn't walk alone at night anywhere in any city if I could avoid it. Because it's a city and there tends to be more crimes in high population areas, because you know..more people to commit crimes. Also, I'm glad that you don't have to take night classes, but a good many of us do. Going to class doesn't make someone a fool."

"Double bachelors in CS and business from one of the top 50 business schools in the nation champ. Try again. You were attempting to obscure that greed is the main driver. You tried to hide it behind \"cost\" and offered that as some kind of rebut to my statement. You attempted to separate \"profit\" from ridiculous pay. Like the company is losing out by charging less and there is nothing they could do to lower cost. You did that. That is exactly what you did. It's one in the same. You really think a billion dollars is a stretch in the medical community? As somebody right down the street from a shiny new Hudson Alpha campus, let me tell you - you're full of shit. They could easily cut a billion off the top of the payroll and everybody would still be rich. You wanted to make some distinction and make an excuse for the behavior. An excuse doesn't exist. They could cut costs - off the payroll for starters - and lower their prices for people whose lives depend on this. I don't care how many free market zealot neck beards fresh out of college agree with you. You're still wrong. You want to know the fastest way I could run my business into the ground? I could loot my company assets as salary and bonuses, then turn around and try to raise costs on our clients to make up for the short. If my client's life depended on the product, and the government stood in the way of anybody else offering the same service, then that would probably work. I'm not in the medical industry and nobody dies if they don't get my services, so that won't work for me. I'm not saying anything about caps. I am saying the government protections should be reduced.

"Actually the value of marijuana is estimated to be hyperinflated by ~3600% do to the risk involved of being sold on a black market. Sure it's a bit more complicated to grow than people who say \"dude its called weed for a reason, it'll grow anywhere\", but it is still just a plant. It really doesn't cost all that much to produce. Considering medical marijuana has dropped to the point in that state where you can get an ounce for around 200, 100ish for a quarter isn't all that bad and about on par as street prices now. The state needs to issue more tracking tags to allow shops to have a larger supply as right now the demand is going to be kept artificially very high because they are limiting the growers to grow much less then they really need. Otherwise the supply and demand for \"legal\" marijuana will put its price higher then illegal weed, and you will have done nothing to eliminate the black market portion of marijuana sales. But it's the supply dictated by the amount of tags given out that will mandate this, not the tax alone."

"The only way to make money on this is through addiction? I can tell you that as a recovering alcoholic that I am keenly aware of the many people who have no problem drinking in a responsible manner.

Why make your own business if not to make more money than working for someone else (this doesn't have to be your main reason to start a business, but it sure as hell was factored into it)? I am greedy, so are you, and so is everyone else, you business making even the smallest profit is proof of that.\n\nTLDR: Expenses (like labor) are flexible.

"&gt;These are very different questions/controversies. \n\nI think they are aspects of the very same controversy.  Yes, there are distinct differences differences that you have pointed out.  There isn't going to be an all encompassing explanation of what we value in a human being because value itself is subjective and often mutually exclusive between groups of people.  \n\nJust think about abortion.  A huge portion of people don't care if you want to terminate a human zygote below a certain age while other do.  It even has the *capacity* for self observation, awareness, and willfully self direct their ongoing formation.  It has just not developed close enough to  yet to resemble a human for people to feel it matters.  Some people don't care if the thing doesn't have nerves or a consciousness yet, even if it *would have* soon.  The capacity is definitely there.  As we get further and further into the process, *more* people start to feel it has gained attributes deserving of rights.  More people are comfortable banning late term abortions than 2 week abortions because they feel more is lost in the former.  I know you don't want to describe it as I have, but I feel this whole discussion can be simplified down to what we consider a human deserving of *worth*.  The zygote is a biological human with all of the genetic makeup of a human just like the brain dead woman on her death bed.  There are people who have no problem terminating either of them.  One has further capacity, the other does not.  I use examples like these in discussions because it's easier to understand the grey area when I point out the extremes of a spectrum."

"The plaintiffs would argue for more scrutiny.  Basically, the level of scrutiny is the test the court applies to determine if law is constitutional.  If the government passed a law that specifically applied to a race of people, for example, it would get \"strict scrutiny.\"  Here, the court applied an intermediate level of scrutiny, which is pretty deferential to the legislature.  It apparently required the state to show that the law was designed to address an important government interest (public safety), and that whatever they did was substantially related to that.  So the question was not whether it would work, or whether it's a good law, but rather whether banning the \"assault weapons\" here was \"related\" to public safety. \n\nI do agree that the legislature's focus on long arms and supposedly \"military style\" features is really nonsensical.

"The entire basis of human understanding is built upon imperfect knowledge and our effort to sift through the bullshit, just like unwarranted speculation of a man being a child molester or allegations of your mother being a whore.  As I have said, perfect knowledge is neither reasonable nor necessary for making judgements.  If you want to argue that there wasn't enough information and you'd need a full investigation before passing a value judgement, I can respect that.  I cannot respect a request for *perfect* knowledge because it's not attainable, nor has it been necessary to advance our species to the point where we are at.  We can communicate via digital signals through fiber optic mediums and satellites.  Nobody yells \"whoa hold on, we don't have *perfect* knowledge of the behavior of subatomic particles\" that make up the electrons we're sending back and forth to communicate.  We use what we know to make reasonable judgements.\n\nThe guy had a valuable service, had to be intelligent to attain the ability of that service, and he had to devote a large amount of time and effort to be able to do it.  We don't know if he was a secret child molester, but it's a *douchebag* move to even bring it up without any evidence.  I brought up your mother being a whore because I knew it would get a rise out of you, and it would illustrate the absurdity and annoyance of having to respond to speculation without evidence."

HOWEVER Pt.2 - all of the natural gas buildings I've been to with interior gas leaks have occupants who forcefully state \"I smelled gas!\" or, \"I smelled rotten eggs!\", and yet none of the reporting I've read has attributed a gas odor prior to this explosion.

"You're logic is terrible. He's saying that once a person is good &amp;amp; settled is a good time to begin discussing giving. \n\nMaybe your logic works for how schmoes who \"give\" $5 to the Santa with the bell, but when someone spent 25 years working 80 hrs a week to make things happen, there's not a lot of time left to worry about anything but spending time with ones family when one can. Once they \"slow down\" and can assess how much they have vs. what they need/want, those people can end up being more generous than when they are young &amp;amp; worried about other things. \n\nAnd due to compounding, the TOTAL they will be able to give will be higher than if they had given a smidge when they were younger &amp;amp; less well off. \n\nThe only people in my profession who give, and give generously are old people. \n\nAnd if what you do works for you hey great, but don't discredit a billionaires' opinion on billionaires giving money. \n\n\nTl;dr He's not wrong, it's easier to give larger amounts when you are more comfortable/settled in life. \n\nEdit- my tone sounded \"mad\", didn't like it coming across that way. \n"

"Jesus this thread is rough. \n\nI'm a 20 year old white guy who lives two blocks from there. I go there all the time. My band plays at one of those restaraunts (*Red Sea*) every couple months. We pick a new ethnic place to eat every show so I've been to many many places around there and met plenty of people. I dont know everything about the area and I'm probably not 100% correct, but I'm *way* more qualified than most people posting here. \n\nIt's not a ghetto, and it's also not downtown. As others have said, it's the Cedar-Riverside neighborhood. Yeah everyone calls those colorful buildings the crack stacks, but *they're just as far away from the picture as the Triple Rock.* Maybe not quite, but close. It's not some isolated suburb.  \n\nThe people there are really nice. I've met some rude people there, just like anywhere, but overall it's friendly. A few doors down from this is a sweet little restaraunt that makes the best mango slushies.\n\n*Anyway,* my point here is that I've been on this block many times and it's not advertised as a Mosque anywhere,  nor is there distinct indication that it is a primarily ethnic neighborhood besides the people or maybe a *Halal!* sign on a meat shop. If someone was really racist and wanted to inflict damage as some are suggesting, trust me: this wouldn't be as obvious a target as the article alludes.  \n\nOn the other hand, some of those buildings are old and janky. I wouldn't doubt that the gas lines are well below code standards. \n\nAlso, its *Somalis.* \"Somalians\" isn't correct. If someone seriously used \"Americanians\" you wouldn't take then seriously. \n\n\n"

"You are either acting intentionally obtuse or are really just not reading the link that I provided at all. Please allow me to help. \n\nFrom the Wikipedia link I provided...\n\n\"The right to keep and bear arms was first recognized as a constitutional right under Article 10 of the Mexican Constitution of 1857.[7] However, as part of the Mexican Constitution of 1917, Article 10 was changed[8] where-by the right to keep and bear arms was given two separate definitions: the right to keep (derecho a poseer in Spanish) and the right to bear (derecho a portar in Spanish).[9] The new version of Article 10 specified that citizens were entitled to keep arms (own them) but may only bear them (carry them) among the population in accordance to police regulation.[10] This modification to Article 10 also introduced the so-called ...[arms] for exclusive use of the [military]... (in Spanish: ...de uso exclusivo del Ejército...), dictating that the law would stipulate which weapons were reserved for the armed forces, including law enforcement agencies, for being considered weapons of war.\n\n\"**In 1971, Article 10 of the present Constitution was reformed[11] to limit the right to keep arms within the home only (in Spanish: ...derecho a poseer armas en su domicilio...) and reserved the right to bear arms outside the home only to those explicitly authorized by law (i.e. police, military, armed security officers).**\"\n\nMasters do not allow slaves to own guns.

"I was offended because I hate the stereotype. I hate that people assume because you use marijuana that you are jobless, unproductive, trash. It's not true. I know it's not true and I do my best to show people that it isn't true. My initial response probably wasn't the best way to get that across, however, those words only perpetuate that stereotype. "

"Not directly, no. And they shouldn't. But when times change, courts should adapt. The will of the people is a pretty good indicator of the times, and should factor heavily in the courts decision (whether that decision is for or against the public's will).\n\nMy point was not that what the majority wants is always the right decision, it was that old laws shouldn't be upheld now just because they were upheld previously."

"\nChoosing the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th highest, without saying so is pretty weak.  It's like you skipped the absolute highest but then went with the next 3.   That's cherry picking of the highest order.\n\nA police officer pulling out a gun and shooting someone is not a random occurrence that just happens at some frequency like being hit by lightning.   They presumably shoot based on some threat.   If police were threatened at some constant per-capita level then your analysis would be OK,  but the threat level doesn't stay the same from year to year.  This should be easy to understand.\n\nThe easiest proxies for threat level are to look at the number of officers killed (down to lowest level since 1887) or to look at the rate of violent crime,  which is down to about 1/3rd of what it was from the 70s-mid 90s.    The \"Freakanomics\" hypothesis is that it dropped due to accessibility of abortions that started in the 70s.\n\nThere are other numbers out there that might show a different situation,  but,  I haven't seen them.\n\n\n\n"

It's all about families and clans and everybody else is an outsider.\n\nThe locals get a host of people completely foreign to them, with no desire of any kind to be a Minnesotan, rather just a Somali in Minnesota, and then they start a lot of gangs and export terrorist fighters to the Middle East. \n\nIt's not \"being a dick\" to point out this isn't working.\n\n\n"
