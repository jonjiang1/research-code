"That is right and wrong at the same time. At a shop they will always tell you to ride whatever they sell. Whereas at least on here you will find people who ride almost everything, for example I sell Jamis and Specialized at work (with some other niche brands mixed in) and I have worked on nearly every brand; But I am also sponsored by and ride for Fuji and have personally owned and ridden Trek, Pake, Giant, and a bunch of other brands."

"If the whole rear wheel won't turn (can't roll the bike), that means there's something wrong with the main wheel bearings. Probably some water got inside the bearings and froze them solid.  \nIf this is the case, It's best to do a hub overhaul (if it's a loose-bearing-style hub.) Most shops charge $20-30 to do this. They will disassemble, clean, repack and readjust the bearing. You can also do it yourself with a few special tools.  \nWith fresh grease inside it should keep water out. It's a good idea to overhaul hubs once a year or two for bikes used regularly or in wet climates. Good luck!"

"i just started riding (note: i raced BMX for several years as kid so I ride bike somewhat oddly - not used to road riding - i have elbows out and push hard) in April 2013 after getting anemia straight with iron infusions ... it's as if i had all the energy in the world now ... was doing close to 90miles/week ... though on fairly flat trails. Since temps dropped below 70degrees (i'm a wimp) i've started taking spin for first time EVER (actually, that's a lie, i did it once like 15yrs ago but walked out of the class 15min in because it was too hard). I've been slamming it. Love it, dreaming of warmer temps and stronger body outside soon. I have a specialized crosstour (?) and love it, just got a new saddle for Christmas and cannot wait to get real biking shoes (seriously, what brand should i get - geezus there are soo many, i feel creepy just staring at everyone's feet in spin class trying to figure out what brand shoe they're wearing). Sadly though,  found out I must have a pretty invasive surgery this week with long (6-8wks no bike) recovery ... took my last spin class last night. Now I live vicariously through you all until I recover and get back on bike in late Feb/March. I do hope to read/learn enough from you all to get some drop bars for my bike by March (40th birthday!!) as a gift to self for persevering through it all. :)     (it's NYE and staying in lying low to be ready for surgery but i am slightly buzzed - excuse typos)\n\nedit - +TLDR\n\nTL;DR - i fucking started riding my bike this year - now i cannot - i'm lurking on you all so i can slam it once fully recovered. Don't let me down and tell me what shoes/drop bars i should get. LMAO"

"... and got rid of the front brake."
"she did that so smoothly. I'm getting better but it's still not as smooth as that for me.\n"
"I would skip the one with a front fork, it will do almost nothing and will weigh a  lot.   \n\nAt this price point it will be probably best to ride both and see which one you like best.   Also, get the bike fitted before you leave the store.   And buy a good U lock with cable.    \n\nThe trek has a better rear derailleur than the cannodale.

"Hey, Happy New Year! Best wishes for your goals."
"Hey there. I work at a Trek Dealer, so I can help you out with the Trek and the Verve. The Cannondale I don't know a whole lot about unfortunately. \n\n\nThe Verve: This is a bike more on the side of recreation. You're going to be in a fairly comfortable, upright position on this guy, similar to a cruiser but not quite as relaxed. You've got a little bit of suspension on the front end (50mm), which would be nice if you plan on taking a slightly bumpier route and want the absorption. You've got a pretty basic 21-speed drivetrain with twist shifters. The drivetrain setup is about as low-end as it gets on any big-name brand, but it's not awful either. The Verve is going to be the most comfort oriented and casual bike out of the three.\n\n\nThe FX: The 7.2 is probably my favorite out of the three. It's classified as a fitness hybrid, so you're going to be in a slightly more aggressive position while riding this bike. It's going to perform better on the road and be faster than the Verve. The groupset is a 24 speed setup with push/pull shifters, which is definitely a step up from the Verve. You also have the option on the 7.2 to get disc brakes for 50 bucks more, which I would definitely recommend. They're a little more efficient and reliable than the V-Brakes in this case. Overall, this is going to be the fastest bike of the three in my opinion. It doesn't have front suspension, but if you plan on sticking mainly with asphalt, I really don't think it'll be that big of a difference at all. \n\n\nThe Cannondale: This bike seems similar to the FX. It's got a similar groupset/drivetrain, and the geometry is closer to that of the FX than that of the Verve. I have not ridden or sold this bike to anyone, so I can't say much more about it. If I were you, I'd ride this bike and the F and see how they feel, because geometry and fit is going to be the largest deciding factor with these two I think. I'm not sure if you can get this bike with disc brakes, but if you can I would. \n\nI hope that helps. The bikes are all similar, so I understand why you would be torn between them. If it were my choice, I would go with the FX because I like how the bike feels and rides. You should go with what rides and feels the best to you. Try not to let 50-100 dollars in price influence your choice heavily. Go with what feels the best and what makes you the happiest, because everyone deserves to be happy on a bike. Good luck, and ride safe!"
"OH you must!! Local bike group is called The Scorchers and apparently it has to do with early cycling. I'd love to read a bit on women related to that term."
"To be honest, I've only owned a mountain bike for, like...nine months, now.  I was a cyclocross and road racer long before then.  There's a local 6-hour MTB series I had participated in once on a 'cross bike, and since I'm on a shop team I got a good deal on the SS I have now and ended up winning and getting podium in a couple 6-hour races this year.  Endurance mountain biking is just...the most incredible and fun thing on a bike ever.  I can't configure words to sufficiently describe how wonderful it is being there.  I did compete in the Mohican 100 earlier this year, but I had no idea what I was getting into.  While it was fun, I mostly just got the nutrition and gear ratio (single speed problems) know-how I need to do better next year.\n\nAlso, buy a Salsa mountain bike.  It's the best bike-related money you will ever, ever spend."

"I guess it depends on your drive. I know for me, if I don't get the hours in I will not meet my race goals, so I put in the hours no matter what (as long as I can that is, no mechanical issues, no injuries, etc)."
"No doubt. A fine bike with shit tyres. Essential upgrade here."
"Shimano currently makes durace 10spd downtube sifters that are not terribly expensive. That would get you upgraded to 10spd..[Vuelta](http://www.nashbar.com/bikes/Product_10053_10052_507094_-1___202478) those minus the stickers would probably look good as well.. Ive been rocking a pair for bout two years now and they have held up nicely."
"Oh god, kill it and put it out of its misery."
"Cycle paths are great for people commuting or out for leisure riding, but he matching Lycra sorts will have a bad time on paths. If we're honest they aren't exactly path friendly, big groups and at speed don't belong on paths with children and recreational riders. \n\nI often ride the road rather than the bike path, I don't want to travel slowly to be safe and I will not inflict the risk of my speed on those on the path, it isn't fair to them. Also what is fine for slower riding is not okay at pace on a road bike, a lot of paths I see pose risks to me on my bike so I'd rather not. Where possible I will use a path, I don't want to use road space if a good path has been built for me, but sometimes it just isn't a good idea. \n\nHopefully that helps. Happy new year, ride safe. "
"Yeah no way I'm touching a snake if I see one when I'm out riding, there are plants that kill you down here. "
"Great all around tires.  I race on open Corsica as they are faster but wear super fast and I have to run at 130 to feel good. \n\n4000s I have raced on and they are great. Hook up well in wet. I get 7-8000 k on a set. Not much more to ask for\n"
"That would have some impact but I am more talking about the road surface will flex the fork forward, back and upward. Normally that load point of that force is placed on the bearing race on the fork. It's designed to handle that repeated stress. This fork will now see that load on the side walls of the steerer tube. The steerer tube is not designed for direct load placed against it. Because of that it would likely crack and then fail. "
"I've tried telling people to move on to the right side as I passed them, only to get told to go fuck myself etc. Knobheads gonna knobhead, they don't want your advice even if it might help them as you're just a bike wanker. Try not to hit them and try not to worry mate. "

Doing a frame is really fussy with regard to measuring and cutting and then gets downright silly with cold setting and reefing on the tubing. You use great big pipes, vises, and blocks of wood (or whatever's handy) to get everything re-aligned since the welding or brazing process warps the hell out of your joints.

"Not much above walking speed.\n\nWe've tried to figure out why she hit her head so much harder than you'd expect. One possibility is that being on a bike is very different from walking.\n\nIf you're walking along and you trip, you don't tend to fall like a plank. And you tend to throw out your hands. I'm suspecting that this didn't happen when she fell. Probably kept her hands on the bars and tried to steer out of the fall.\n\nImagine holding a watermelon at shoulder level and dropping it on to the pavement.\n\nLooking at the helmet, the impact seems to have been to the temple.

"This looks nice. Make sure you either swap out those pedals for platforms or get the matching shoes off the owner. Never used clipless myself but I imagine that if you've also never done downtube shifting it might be a bit much to get used to all at once.\n\nGiven the level of customization I'm seeing here (relatively new saddle, clipless pedals, and ... well, *unorthodox*, but well-executed bar setup), it's clear that the previous owner liked this bike, knew what he was doing, and therefore probably kept pretty good care of it.\n\nLike others (and yourself) have said, you will almost definitely want to raise the brake levers. I guess the other guy really, really liked riding in the drops. If you don't have much money, you'll probably want to do almost all your bike maintenance yourself; it's a pretty easy fix and a good way to start getting your hands dirty. Whatever you do, DON'T just rotate the bars up. They're pretty much at the right angle as is. You will probably want to move the levers until the clamps that hold them to the bar are just above the end of where the bar tape is now.\n\nAs far as downtube shifting goes, it takes some getting used to, especially if you grew up on a MTB with indexed grip shifters, but it's really not so hard to get used to. For me the biggest thing was avoiding the temptation to try and look down to confirm I'd shifted into the right gear while moving. You kinda just have to learn what the levers look like when they're in each gear, and just sorta do the whole thing by feel. Shouldn't take too long to get used to, though, maybe a couple hours' practice over a couple days."

"Donated it to Bikeworks.  http://bikeworks.org/\n\nThey work with kids to teach them wrenching (and they can earn a bike).  They run a shop with good prices for work and used bikes.  They gave a bike to a brain-injured guy who volunteered at the library, after his bike was stolen. \n\nThey are cool. \n\nSelling my dear old bike would have felt like some kind of betrayal.  Donating it was less painful, doing something good and in a way thanking Bikeworks for helping the library guy. \n\nEddit: grammerz"

"I have had bad experiences with the Forte (Performance bike's house brand) tubes, though could've just been a bad batch, but I bought about a dozen of them and almost all of them slowly lost air and went flat overnight. I just returned them and ordered some similarly priced Kendas and have no issues with any of them (I fix a lot of friends bike and random strangers on the trails, and keep a bunch on hand).\n\nLike I said, it's possible that it was just a bad batch, but that makes you question their quality control if a dozen or more slipped through."
"If you get lucky with the necessary items on craigslist/ebay restoring could be possible for $300 or less. \n\nI picked up mint downtube shifters, a  NOS freewheel cluster, rear derailleur (new shimano tiagra), and mint tricolor shimano 600 double pivot calipers for around $90. Once I get the correct chain, my single speed will be upgraded to a geared bike for only $100! \n\nYou'll need to get a different rear wheel which will set you back some, but this is definitely doable for $200-300 if you're alright with not having matching wheels. The components you'll be buying won't be the best (used), but they'll work as long as you're patient and get good deals. It won't be a race worthy, but it'll be a fine bicycle. \n\nThink about what you want to do with the bike, how aesthetically nice you want it to look, your budget, and then decide. \n\nFor instance, once I'm done rebuilding my bike it'll be working great with some nice components here and there. However, it won't look fantastic. I'm alright with that, though I wish I could drop $500 on it and make it real purdy. "

As the previous paragraph says, the stuff is nearly pure protein. If you look protein up in a dictonary you'll find it's a class of nutrient.\n\n&gt;The same with “High Fructose Corn Syrup,” another ingredient in many energy bars. It is corn processed until all that remains is pure carbohydrate and again very little nutritional value.\n\nAgain, carbohydrates _are_ nutrients. They are essential in endurance sport.

"Yeah I went out New Years Day AM about 7am so it was still dark.\n\nI'm pretty sure there were at least a couple of 'still pissed from the night before's' out driving early. Possible even 'not gone to bed yet's' as well.\n\nRoads were pretty empty though so it was worth it imo.\n\nOne guy did head straight for me on a collision course at one of these road furniture things we have in the UK to try and slow traffic by turning 2 lanes into one at the entrance to a village (but they don't slow it - they just force 60mph cars onto the wrong side of the road racing towards you to beat you to the gap. Which is exactly what this guy was doing but he misjudged it so much I had to stop and dive into the curb to avoid being hit. So, if he wasn't drunk he was one terrible driver.\n\nThe others were people who tailgated at 8am, so daylight by this time, on an empty straight road - a sure sign imo of someone being too careful, which is the opposite of drunken bravado when driving - people who are over compensating when worse for wear by trying to avoid overtaking or other moves they might get wrong.\n\nI'd just gone out to cycle up and down my street to test a new cleat position and ended up doing 40km."
"i agree.  i have had good luck with my kid on a push bike.  (google: kids push bike or Strider balance bike).  I have seen people take a bike like your son has, remove the training wheels, pedals and cranks.  that way its a push bike till they get balance.  Later you can add the cranks back in."

"The weight issue was largely due to massive carbon reinforcement on his disc equipped Colnagos. Trek has had this bike in development for years and it's likely that the weight penalty between the canti and disc model is quite minimal compared to his Colnagos in the same form."

"I don't know the weight difference off the top of my head, but I know the canti version has a full carbon fork and steerer. I'm not sure if the disc version has a carbon steerer or not, but it's definitely beefier, although definitely not in the same league as his Colnagos."

"How often do you run into fellow world traveler's while touring? Are there general \"routes\" that people have tracked out to be more efficient that people generally take and meet up on- or is it just a \"hey, you also look like you have a bike stocked up for the long haul, where are you going?\" situation?"
"Came here to say 'insert' but since most of your decision here is about cost I'm wondering if you just epoxied a pedal in there? There's probably enough thread there combined with some glue to hold it together?"
"I'd done a month long tour and lost feeling in my fingers for weeks afterwards. When I decided to ride around the world I knew I needed a better solution. Reading journals on CGOAB introduced me to trikes, and there is a big trike shop in my state so I was able to drive an hour or so away to test ride a couple. It's great for long slow slogs up mountains because you can gear down and spin at whatever speed you need without tipping over. You can even stop for a break. Coasting down the far side you go faster than any regular bike. You also don't notice most headwinds. It's awkward taking it on planes, trains, or automobiles but no worse than a regular bike with a trailer. "
"Shimano's initial road disc brakeset for consumers added 300g. That was before full release. The weight penalty doesn't just come from the brakeset, but the reinforcement on the frame as well. For example, the canti version of the Trek Boone is a full carbon fork with carbon steerer. The disc model comes with an aluminum steerer with a carbon fork reinforced in certain areas with alloy.\n\nEdit: When referencing his first race with a disc equipped Colnago \"The difference [in weight] is about two bottles of water, and it's not all in the brakes,\" Nys said. \"It's an adapted frame which is strengthened. It's too much. Too much to run up a climb with that bike on your back.\" -Sven Nys"
"There are definitely routes that are more popular but it's also a question of popularity and season. On the west coast of the US you'll end up camping with dozens of cycle tourists every night along the route. In the Outback in Australia the Stewart highway is the main route north and south, but because few people ride it I heard about plenty of riders from locals but never saw anyone else. "

"With that aresenal of springs, I bet that seat is like sitting on a motorboatin' angel's face.  Kid probably has better style and less saddle sores than anyone I know."
"I see the bike as a reasonable, viable, and accessible mode of transportation. I don't really title people on a bike, much in the same way I don't title people in cars \"motorists\" or the like. Unless we're conducting some sort of road use survey, I don't see a need for these titles.\n\ntldr; I'm just a dude on a bike."
"[There is a t-shirt on her Topatoco shop](http://www.topatoco.com/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&amp;Store_Code=TO&amp;Product_Code=BEAT-VELOCIPEDE-SLATE&amp;Category_Code=BEAT), but yes, this needs to be a full kit."
"This bike is in my 2014 bike plan."
"What kind of ride doesn't allow for patch kits? Why bring co2 at all if you have a pump? It's just throwing money away."
"what a sad state that the sport has come to when not just the pros dope but guys who are just doing it for fun"
"That's good to hear. Currently debating TRP Spyre or the TRP HYRD on my current build. Not sure if the HYRDs are worth the extra 120$. "
"main benefits of buying your kid a LBS bike, resale value for when he outgrows it that and it doesn't weigh almost (or more) than half the kids weight. "
"I went from CX-75 brakes to the TRP Hy/Rd and was not that impressed until I swapped out my cables and housing to compressionless Yokozuna. Then I was blown away at how well they worked. Just FYI. OP- Congrats on the new ride!"
"TRP is the brake brand HyRd is the model. The HyRd is a cable actuated hydraulic disc brake. "

"Spyre were recalled. I'm not sure if they're back on the market yet. "
"Yup. They aren't abbreviations, just brand names. The HyRd system allows you to combine the versatility and easy availability of cable brake levers with the smooth modulation of hydraulic disc brakes. This allows the use of shifters/brakes with no hydraulic equivalent. For example, I can use a standard mechanical 105 gruppo with cable brakes, and then connect the cables to the HyRds, where the cable drives a piston in a hydraulic cylinder on the brake, [like so](http://www.trpbrakes.com/category.php?productid=1198&amp;catid=206&amp;subcat=0).\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/IW8simF.gif"
"Well, now that's an amazing bargain!"
"My Secret Santa got me the same thing!"
"Looks like an amazing journey man!\n\nI've always wanted to do something like this, and have been thinking of taking some time soon, Just one question? Where do you stay? How do you plan? Just pour over maps or are these resources with other peoples advice ect?\n\nCheers"
"Sold my car, commute to work on my single speed in hilly Cincinnati. "
"I saw the recall. They are already shipping the corrected units to customers. "
"lol right? What a fucking dork. That's not a bike, it's an abomination. I hope this shit gets downvoted to hell."
"Yeah, the reviews seemed great. Only problem was the noise level, from what I read. But it's not like my mag trainer is whisper quiet either"
"Is that an old school GT Talera? "
"Err ... what?"
"No."
"If its a real aerojoke he really could upgrade the hell out of this bike for that wheel. Hell, if i saw a aerospoke for a couple hundred id probably buy it..."
"A-men. Traditional bend deep-drop bars are where it's at."
"I said the same thing about my friends bike. He stripped down a Bianchi road bike to a fixed gear. He told me after I saw the picture that it was really run down and couldn't do much else with it.\n\nIf the previous owner actually got just the frame second hand I am all for this conversion. Breathing new life into a old frame that was gathering dust. "
"If the back wheel is a real aerospoke you can restore the hell out of that bike by selling the back wheel. All in all it looks like a nice bike, just nees some TLC. Especially for free."
"I spent about 2 years planning the trip, and 5 years saving the money for it.  In the US I stayed at campgrounds or free campsites in city parks (Kansas and Missouri allow it along the Transamerica).  In Australia I camped, or stayed at hostels.  Mostly hostels once I found out they were charging equivalent prices and had them all over the place.  In the Outback I often just camped on the side of the road.  Far enough away from the road to avoid crazy drunk driver crashes, and often behind some natural barrier to avoid the curious.  In Asia hotels were from $5-$15 so I just stayed there, especially since camping isn't as big a thing.  Some people I talked to had luck asking for permission to camp in people's yards, but I really appreciated the running water, wifi, and privacy that a room afforded me at the end of a day.  Europe was back to camping again, but as in most larger cities I would get a hotel room so I could explore without worrying about my stuff I ended up staying in a lot of hotels in Europe.\n\nMy planning started with me brainstorming a giant list of all the cool things I'd heard about in the world that I wanted to see.  Then I made a basic plot of a route that would take me past most of them.  Then I started reading about the areas I would be going through in travel books, traveler journals, weather reports, and anything else I could find.  I started putting together a rough estimation of distances between places, figured out how long it would take me to get from place to place, looked at visa requirements, border crossings, elevation maps, and so on in order to get an even more detailed idea of where I needed to go.  Cross-referencing climate with travel dates let me shift my schedule around so I could avoid winter throughout the whole trip, flying to Australia in the northern hemisphere's fall, and crossing over the equator to the north as the seasons changed again, heading north with the spring.  All this turned into a giant spreadsheet with daily mileage estimates, rest days, tourism days and so forth.  I plugged in estimates on prices and used that as a budget to plan for how much I needed to save.  \n\nWhile I was doing all this planning I also started doing more and more tours in the US.  Lots of overnight camping, and once or twice a year a week or two long tour.  Around Lake Michigan, Seattle to San Francisco, RAGBRAI, the KATY trail, the Natchez Trace Parkway.  Lots of rides to test out gear, find what worked for me, and most importantly of all, test my enjoyment of spending long days on a bike and nights in a tent.  I put on thousands of miles doing that, and in doing so was able to be confident in my gear, my own abilities, and my knowledge of what I was capable of.  Quite a long way from my very first tour.  On that one I actually carried a spare blanket because my sleeping bag wasn't warm enough at night, and I had to walk my bike up lots of hills.  Now I know what it feels like to spend hours riding to the top of a mountain pass, and minutes coasting back down the far side.\n\nIt's easy enough to just toss some gear together and hop on your bike.  If you're really interested in it, start doing some overnight camping trips with your bike.  In less than 24 hours you can get a good idea of how prepared you are for it.  Also, check out AdventureCycling.org if you're in the US.  They've got excellent maps and the routes are popular enough there's a great chance of meeting other riders out on the road.  "
"That bike looks hot!"
"Damn, that Japanese guy just looks so fucking happy. Great smile!"
"There are mirrors on most of the corners so they have an idea if something is coming, and they can probably see further down the road than the camera lets on. That said, they are using the road to its fullest extent."
"I think it's a late 90s GT Palomar. Got it off craigslist and converted it to a SS winter commuter. "
"You are remarkably calm. I commend you. I don't know how the UK legal system works at this level but I'd probably be prepared to get arrested at this point if I had video of the \"high speed collision\". They were just saying shit because they probably knew the officers have to act on both statements because it's just \"he said/she said\" and they don't have the authority to make evidence based judgements on scene. A detective or sergeant might.\n\nHe's basically saying: I can arrest both of you and a judge/lawyers will sort it out or you can both leave on your own accord because this decision is above my paygrade.\n\n"
"Or you get a crocodile and a proper bike, you then chase them with the crocodile. That's how I was taught to ride a bike and develop an irrational fear of Crocodiles. "
"\"As I said, there are far bigger dangers than cops in bike lanes.  Occasionally these dangers are fatal.  Eric would not still be alive if NYPD vehicles stayed out of bike lanes\"  what?"
"It depends on the child"
"Nice captions- \"The Wright's made their own bikes before moving up in the world.\"\nHa! I see what you did there...\n\nGreat photos. Congrats on what looks like a successful and amazing tour!"
"Those are some fascinating bikes! Thanks for sharing. The picture of the KT trail brings back some memories of riding it with some friends about 10 years ago. It's interesting to see dropped handle bars on some of the really old bikes like the Wright model. I wouldn't have guessed anyone was biking fast enough for that to matter back then but clearly these guys were building for speed! "
"Since I work in healthcare an arrest would spell doom for my employment and since I have \"no recourse to public funds\" by being foreign I need to work.\n\nI dunno if calm is the right words...maybe so confused by the stupidity that it felt surreal. As you noticed from the rest of the video you can't see squat ."
"I would say a rational fear of crocodiles. "
"It'd hold. I've got spare pedals doing nothing, op probably has too."
"CROCODILES!? WHERE?"
"&gt; The general consensus from talking to older rider riders is that cycling was ALWAYS so much better when they were young; Plenty of races, quality riders and \"real\" bikes.\n\nThat's just sorta human nature.  Everything sucks compared to when we were younger.\n\n"
"Building wheels is the easy part, truing and tensioning is the hard part. I've built loads of wheels now, can knock out a set in a couple of hours."
"I hope you get downvoted to hell. Oh wait. You already are."
"Why are you asking everyone if they rode a TT bike?"
"Thanks for the reply (and happy new year).  From your description, the mitts sound like some solid snowmobiling things. I'll try to borrow something similar from friends before shelling out to see if that will work for me.\n\nI'm a bit leery of the lobster mitts because of losing the team heating aspect of having all my fingers together.\n\nI also got some hot shots/single use hand warmer things from relatives in Ottawa that think -13 is cold. I'm going to try these out in my current mitts if it ever warms up from -30 here."
"Yeah. It's fucking stupid. All you can do is ride on."
"Rode 26 miles down PCH without a helmet. Never again. "
"Had a very pleasant ride to a restaurant and Second City show last night. It was snowing very hard here in Chicago and the streets were bad, but drivers and pedestrians alike seemed incredibly patient. We left the show a little early and were actually on our bikes when the midnight hour struck, it was *extremely* calm on the roads. Thanks for being patient and polite, Chicago drivers. Last night could have been a real disaster."
"I believe this is the only study of the benefits of balance bikes: http://www.prweb.com/releases/2012/11/prweb10178397.htm\n\nNot sure how impartial it was.\n\nI agree with /u/grantrules that it depends on the child. \n\nI learnt on training wheels but feel I would've learnt faster on a balance bike because I wasn't scared of falling as a child."
"My father rolled my sorry ass down a long gravel driveway, on a green bike with no working brakes, into a barn filled with hay. Repeatedly.\n\nDoes not sound plausible. Is reality."
"Bashguard. You don't need it, if your chain is coming off then your front derailleur isn't adjusted properly."
"Fantastic bike! You won't be disappointed. Also, if you need a rack, Thule makes one that will work without braze ons."
"I assume the chain goes beyond the big chainring up front when shifting into the higher (harder) gear with that piece (bashguard / chainguard) broken off?\n\nIf so the problem is not the lack of the piece, but rather that your front dérailleur's outer limit screw is set too slack and allows the front dérailleur to travel too far outboard.\n "
"Generally kids (and adults!) seem to learn faster on a balance bike, if you use training wheels/stabilisers then the kid doesn't learn to balance on their own.\n\nYou don't actually need to pedal to balance a bike. Take your feet off the pedals and see."
"Cool trip. I really dig the family bike in the second to last photo. \n\nWhat was your biggest \"oh shit\" moment of the tour? "
"That's awesome!  2013 was my first year riding also.  I finally just got fitted on my bike, and am planning to do my first ride from LA to SD.  SF to LA impressive!"
"It depends, but in more cases your friend is right, and you're wrong.\n\nAlso: pedaling, not peddling."
"Roids, EPO, Speed, and Viagra? I ain't even mad...that's amazing!"
"[This](http://ridewithgps.com/routes/2754100) was the route they rode that day. Video is on the descent from the second, smaller hill."
"LOL these bikes crack me up... there's very few places I'd wanna leave something like that locked up. What's up with that massive gap between the brake bridge and the fender? And what kind of urban and/or touring bike doesn't have any rack mounts? Looks nice and slick that's for sure but it could be a lot more practical for the price, which I'm guessing has gotta be over 2000 bucks... I think the geometry is more like a track bike than anything else. The company also sells axes(???) so I think they're not really all that serious about thinking their bikes design through and more concerned about the looks and the photography. "
"As a bodge, it's a temporary fix at best. Also, OP more than likely doesn't have suitable epoxy just lying around so he'd have to buy some. That money could instead have been put towards a new crank."
"This.\n\nYou need to tweak your front derailleur. Shift into the smallest ring in the back and the biggest ring up front. Find the pair of screws on your front derailleur. If you're lucky, they'll be labelled H and L. *Tighten* the H screw until the inner surface of the outside plate is ~1mm from the chain. If the screws aren't labelled, pick one and give it half a turn. If it doesn't move the derailleur, give the other one half a turn. Keep alternating until you figure out which screw is the correct one, keeping track of how many half turns you've done.  When you figure out which scew is the correct one, go back and loosen the other one the correct number of half turns to put it back where it was. Then tighten the correct screw until the derailleur is in the right place as described above.\n\nShift into your smallest ring up front and your largest in back.  Adjust the L screw until the inside surface of the inner plate of the derailleur is ~1mm from the edge of the chain.  Tightening it will move it out (away from the tube it's mounted to), loosening it will move it in.\n\nThis only needs to be done once. It will stay set up correctly until something is changed on the bike.  If you're having further shifting problems up front, *do not* mess with the limit screws..the problem at that point is tension on the shift cable."
"I don't really think it's alarmist. I think the point I was trying to make as the OP was that these carbs and proteins are so processed that the risks outweigh the benefits. It's like refined sugar. Your body reacts better to sugar that is in its natural matrix (fruit, honey, etc). But when it is refined out, it becomes almost like cocaine. It is way too much for your body to handle. I think the carbs and proteins in these bars are the same way. You probably poop more of it out that you actually use. A steak and some beer would probably be much more effective and you don't need to eat as many."
"Worth something only if you love it. I would just toss it. "
"a century a month!"
"Looks like a lot of fun.  Enjoy your adventures!"
"its pretty nice, i just hope you are aware of the issues early carbon frames like this had.\n\ni hope you didn't pay too much as it is an older bike. \n\nJust be sure to inspect all the joints frequently, and listen for any creaking."
"Katy Trail on a 'bent trike. \n\nDid you get any rash or even burns from this? That trail is crushed limestone. The dust mixed with sweat is very alkaline. It's like rubbing lye on yourself. "
"Most people find balance bikes the way to go. While you are right, balancing while pedaling is an important cycling skill, you learn none of that while using training wheels. With a balance binge you have a smooth transition from feet supporting you to long coasting sections without foot contact."
"Thanks for the PSA, i guess. If I had a nickel for every bike that was stolen because it was locked using a cable lock...."
"Oh lord, not the fatties!"
"I committed to a ride across the United States in June 2014 earlier this year. I'll have my first real 'new bike day' here in a few days after just owning previously owned bicycles my whole life. There's a Giant Defy 2 with my name on it and I couldn't be more excited to start training."
"Fun fact: This was THE FIRST* mass-produced carbon bike on the market, and Specialized contracted Giant (formerly manufacturing for Schwinn until they went bankrupt the first time) to make this frame for them. It's got a cool story behind it. \n\nLike /u/zootam said, it's important to pay attention to those joints because galvanic corrosion sometimes gets to the aluminum lugs. Some telltale signs:\n\n* Cracking lacquer on the carbon\n\n* corrosion/discoloration on the aluminum\n\n* inexplicable creaking noises-make sure to rule out all other possibilities first\n\nNice bike OP!\n\n[*One of](http://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/1u6385/what_do_you_guys_think_of_my_first_road_bike/cef5dus)"
"That's the point, they aren't doing it for fun. Just assholes ruining the fun for others."
"It is not. Calcium Carbonate is not particularly soluble in water and less so in sweat. Even a fully saturated solution will max out at pH 11 which is no where near lye and is not dangerous."
"Balance bike."
"What was your route? "
"In Italy I was lazy, and put off some maintenance on my brakes, thinking I could do it in the evening.  Both brakes needed replacement, and one was pretty much useless.  Then I ended up on this road: http://goo.gl/lMbUxq which was a steep winding ride down into a valley. Amazing views, but I was sweating hoping my only brake didn't give out.\n\n\nEarlier in the trip I was in the Outback of Australia and due to a slight miscalculation I ran out of water about 10 miles shy of the next water source.  10 miles doesn't sound like much but it basically meant that I had an hour of riding with no shade with temps hovering around 85 or 90 degrees.  I ended up begging some water from passing tourists, and one family that had forgotten to refuel before leaving town was even nice enough to bring me a bottle of Pepsi and a candy bar after the swung back to the gas station.  It wasn't a deadly mistake, but it sure was an uncomfortable one.  \n"
"OP's response is really in depth but you might be interested in [/r/bicycletouring](http://www.reddit.com/r/bicycletouring) as well. "
"I know right? What a cool guy. His bike has seen some things I bet!"
"Sweet ride.  I love the brakes. Pls repost after you ride and test them out for a while.  My next roadie will have discs.  I like the fact we are seeing more and more discs...."
"Thanks for the advice guys, I picked it up for dirt cheap from a pawn shop that didn't really know what it was worth, if anything I got a good deal on just the components. I inspected it pretty closely and all of the lugs look solid. It's already pretty dialed in but I'm gonna pull it apart and rebuild/clean everything in the next couple weeks, hopefully I don't find anything too devastating."
"I've ridden the length of the Katy trail 3 times, and I've never had any issue like that.  Crushed limestone is a great surface to bike on compared to dirt or gravel, and I'd be thrilled if more unpaved routes used it.  It's especially nice during wet periods.  I've ridden in the rain with it and not had to worry about ruts or soft spots, which definitely isn't the case for dirt trails."
"Up vote for us dudes-on-bikes"
" \"At one race last year, one middle-aged rider got into a fight with a 15-year-old boy.\" Wow."
"Where do you put your stuff and bike when you're in those museums and whatnot?  I have no idea where I'd put it that I wouldn't worry if it got stolen."
"I started in Wisconsin, went down the Mississippi to St. Louis, west along the Transamerica to Pueblo where I took the Western Express route to Burning Man.  Broke south to cross over the mountains at Yosemite, then to San Francisco.  Flew to Sydney, where I followed the coast (except for one jog in to Canberra) to Adelaide.  North to Darwin.  Flew to Singapore.  Bounced up through Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, and China into Hong Kong.  I was burned out on Asia at that point, and in addition to that I had some visa issues that made flying out from Hong Kong seem like the best idea.  So a flight from HK to Rome and then up Italy to France/Monaco along the Mediterranean, and then a C shaped path around France up to Belgium and Netherlands.  Then I took a train through the Eurotunnel to London and flew from there to Washington DC.  From there it was a hop skip and a jump back to Wisconsin where I got home just before winter started up.  About 11,000 miles of riding in all."

"When I'm in a city that's big enough to have a decent museum I usually grab a hotel room for a night or two, making it a combination rest day/tourism day.  Then I use public transport or walk to see what I want.  I've got a collection of NFC subway cards from all over the place now. :)  Sometimes I'm willing to leave my bike with all the gear locked up out front, in view of the museum staff.  You play it by ear.  Most people aren't going to screw with a touring bike, because it usually looks pretty beat up and dirty by the time you get anywhere.  I keep anything valuable or irreplaceable (electronics and such) in my trunk bag which comes off easily and turns into a shoulder bag.  Everything else is just camping gear and clothes.  Easy enough to replace.  That being said, I was lucky.  I only had one bit of gear disappear mysteriously, and it was a water bottle which might have just come loose by accident."
"I picked this bike about two years ago and I've been using it to glide around town. It's a pretty smooth ride. It was in great condition when I got it and it's still running great. Could use some new tape though. "

"If you even suspect that the frame has an issue, just swap all the parts on to another frame from the same era. That Campy seat post, Cinelli bars, Gran Compe brakes, and Shimano 600 group are all great stuff.\n\nI noticed that your front brake quick release is open (up). And the inner tubes are the wrong type, the valve stems are way too long."
"Even those guys wouldn't dare to ride on Wilshire Blvd. in Los Angeles :)\n\nI've taken the lane a bazillion times. I've taken the lane on a 2-lane highway and got honked into oblivion, but there was not only no bike line, but there was a SIGN that said BIKES MAY USE FULL LANE, and had a picture of exactly what I was doing. lol\n\nBut yeah, even the police cyclists don't ride in the street on Wilshire"

"Everybody honked continuously in Vietnam.  It drove me nuts.  You could even hear it at night in a hotel room.  Riding with a taxi, one hand was for steering and the other was for non-stop tapping of the horn.  If I did it again I'd skip Vietnam.  It sounds harsh, but while it's a beautiful country and has lots to offer I just couldn't deal with the constant noise.\n\nAs I mentioned previously, campgrounds were surprisingly expensive in Australia, and hostels offered better amenities for the same price.  \n\nThe roads in southeast Asia nearly all had (moto)bike lanes on the side which actually made it nicer to ride there than in southern Europe, which had very narrow roads with no shoulders.  You wouldn't expect that, but I guess not having a thousand years of baggage to deal with when designing roads really helps.\n\nGetting my visa for Thailand was a serious pain.  They require proof of solvency and I didn't have a printout of a bank statement.  They wouldn't accept an ATM receipt and demanded that I flash a wad of cash before they'd grant the visa.  It was more than I could pull out of the nearest ATM in one day, and since it was late in the day before a Thai national holiday, I would have been delayed several days if I couldn't get my application in that day. Fortunately the clerk filling out the paperwork took pity on me and filed the paperwork while her supervisor had her back turned.  And before anyone asks, yes you get a month in Thailand as an American without a visa, but that's only when flying in.  When arriving by ground you're limited to 2 weeks without a visa.  No where near enough for the time I wanted to spend there.\n\nEurope has really wacky hours for stores.  Buying food on Sunday was nearly impossible, and the hours of restaurants varied depending on the day of the week and the town you were in.  Some places didn't open until 5pm and stayed open late, while others were closing up shop at 5.  Since it varied so much I basically had to eat anytime I found a place that was open since I couldn't rely on anything being available.  Sundays and Mondays were especially bad.  This wasn't the case near tourist locations, and restaurants and stores there stayed open all day long like you would expect to see in America.  International fast food places also kept normal business hours, so if you're willing to eat fast food you can actually get a meal at 3 in the afternoon.\n\nSpeaking of food, chicken in Asia was annoying.  Tasty and fresh, but they prefer the meat to be mixed up with small bone fragments there.  Some sort of cultural difference, which was interesting, but a few times I thought I was going to lose a tooth due to it.\n\nUtah saves money on highways by not installing guard rails on twisty mountain roads.  So watch out on those fast descents if you take the Western Express."
"Hahaha, a lot of your pictures were from the Galileo Museum in Florence! I was just there!"
"Why be suspicious?\nFor 5-10km those bikes and speeds are totally fine.\nIt's a rare thing when I actually have to ride farther than 10km in the city. Applies for many other cities as well.\nI ride a road bike and a mtb. But if cycling was just a means to an end I would ride dutch type and be totally cool with it.\n\nAlso, what's the hurry?\nI like riding so if it lasts a bit longer so be it. And riding till sweaty is for the hobby part of cycling but for day to day stuff I would rather not shower several times a day."
"It has a C&amp;C connector on the frame, and the whole thing breaks down into manageable chunks.  It (mostly) fits into two bicycle boxes.  I'd pick them up at a local bike shop where I was flying out, pack everything up, and take a cab to the airport.  I've been charged anything from nothing to $400 for taking it on a plane.  Once I was quoted a few hundred bucks, but ended up being overweight.  After I'd redistributed things I went back to the desk and got a new clerk who didn't charge me anything.  Another time I was checked in with no charge, but then at a connecting flight they hit me up for a fee since it was a different airline.  Lots of weirdness, but I'd planned on expenses like that, and on a 14 month trip a few hundred bucks extra isn't a huge amount."
"That's what i'm thinking, and the tubes have a slow leak so those will be replaced soon. I am in the market for a new saddle if anyone has any suggestions.."

"Back in my day it was all about the stabilisers. Advantage being you don't need a separate bike. These days balance bikes are the thing. "
"Not really. The risks increase by the type of riding (road cycling or freeride vs. the dutch commuter).\n\nAt least in several places in Europe normal day to day cycling is really safe with or without a helmet. In many places in the U.S. cycling seems to be very risky regardless of precautions.\n\nIt's a culture thing mainly."

"I left home July 13, 2012, and returned September 25, 2013"
"From my experience, balance bikes are the way to go. Pedaling is actually the easy part of biking, and finding a sense of balance is the tricky part. Training wheels usually lead to people focusing on pedaling and rocking from side to side, where balance bikes force you to focus on balancing and your movement is controlled with something you're already familiar with. Kids also seem less nervous on balance bikes be cause they can easily control speed and balance with their feet."
"You don't pedal it.  It's basically a cart when it's fully loaded.  I saw a few present day farmers with crops loaded up like that, and they'd sometimes have a bamboo pole strapped onto the handlebars and another on the seat post sticking off to the side.  That way they could have a giant pile of stuff on the bike and still be able to hold it upright and steer while standing off to the side.  Once you'd dropped off your load you could ride it back home again.  "
"Close to Portland, Oregon."
"Even with adult learners I've found the best method is using the \"balance bike\".  With an adult (or older child/teenager), taking the pedals off and lowering the seat so that the rider can sit and put both feet on the ground is the way to go.\n\nThe act of balancing the bike is the same whether you are coasting or pedaling. Becoming confident with balancing on a bike is the key. Once the rider feels comfortable pushing themselves along and coasting in a straight line move up to gentle turns. Stay away from hills, unless the slope is *really* gentle. The feeling that the bike is getting away from them will scare off new riders. \n\nIt depends on the individual, but most folks will \"get it\" pretty quickly, and before long will be practically running atop the bike and coasting long distances (usually with a big grin plastered on their mugs). At this point put the pedals back on. The transition from pushing with the feet to pedaling the bike will be effortless. \n\nI see it too often with kids (5-9 years old usually), where they are riding along with training wheels and are essentially leaning on the training wheels and riding along tilted over to one side. This does absolutely nothing to teach one how to ride a bike. They're not learning to balance, they're depending on the training wheels to keep them upright! And for the kids you see ripping about on the bikes with training wheels (as in, they probably don't *need* them on the bike but parents or themselves believe they are necessary) they will never learn how to properly turn a bike. You can't lean a bike with training wheels properly. \n\nTL;DR - It's all about the act of balancing the bike, being confident that rolling along atop two wheels is natural. The pedaling is secondary. "

"It's on the low end of the price range for that bike, not totally ridiculous. Could be it's stolen, or that the owner doesn't know much about how prices depreciate in bikes, or maybe they just wanna offload it quick because they need the money.\n\nIf you're truly concerned, check the serial number of the bike (it's usually stamped on the bottom of the bottom bracket shell), then run it by your local police department's stolen bikes registry.\n\nAnyways, for that price it would be a great starter bike. Tiagra shifts well and holds up well. The triple in the front will give you lots of gearing  options,which you'll want as you start to develop power in your legs. Go check it out, and if the seller doesn't give off immediate sketchy vibes, I'd say go for it and then run the serial number (or check the serial number while you're there).\n\nOne last thing, make sure it fits! This is the most important thing, actually. Are you around 6 feet tall? Hope so, otherwise this might not be the bike for you"

"You can carry a steak and a beer in your jersey if you want to, but pretty much every person who lifts or bikes will eat a protein bar or drink a protein shake at some point. Protein shakes do wonders for sore muscles and are much easier and effective than eating a steak. \n\nThere is a time and a place for both, but comparing pure refined protein to pure refined sugar is ignorant. You don't need sugar, you need protein."

"#6 Good Guy Bus! That guy needs an award!\n\nHit and run is the ultimate sign of selfishness and disrespect. The whole \"I'm too busy/important to deal with that right now, and besides, he's just a bike!\" mentality makes me angry to my core."
"Could be a little problem or a slightly bigger one. Either way it's best to have a bike shop have a look because it's not going to fix itself. If you wanna go it on your own, the likely culprits are these (in increasing order of badness):\n\n- There's something stuck in your drivetrain, maybe a shoelace, some rope, whatever. Check the entire chainline, the chainwheels at the front, and the cassette at the back for obstructions.\n\n- Your derailleur(s) is no longer aligned properly due to impact or cable stretch. Set your bike up in such a way that you can look at how the rear derailleur sits below the cassette, now switch through a few gears. In each case, the pulleys of the derailleur should be aligned straight with each other and directly below a cog on the cassette. If this is not the case, your derailleur hanger could be bent or the cable needs to be tensioned. You can find guides to dealing with these problems [here](http://sheldonbrown.com/derailer-adjustment.html)\n\n- Your chain and sprockets may be worn out. As you ride your bike, abrasion slowly wears down the pins in your chain so that the distance between links increases, some people call this chain stretch. As this happens, the chain no longer meshes properly with the cogs of the cassette and they start to wear down into little ramps untilthe chain can slip right off. Unfortunately the only cure to this is to replace the chain and cassette (and possibly chainwheels up front as well). Have your bike shop check for this one."

"I'm generally a pretty introverted person.  After a week on the road I'm willing to talk to just about anyone though.  And any touring cyclist will attest to the fact that you need to be able to.  Everyone wants to hear about the trip and it makes starting conversations pretty damned easy.  It was very rare that I would run into people that didn't speak English.  One memorable occasion was at a Vietnamese hotel I stayed at.  The receptionist was interested in what I had picked up at the grocery store for dinner, but she didn't speak English.  I introduced her to the foreign delicacy of Ritz Crackers with peanut butter.  She seemed to like them, but didn't think her son would so he just had a cracker without peanut butter.  It's a fond memory of communicating with gestures and food.\n\nAt some points I could have done with a little more isolation.  Thailand was so full of people that I could pull over to the side of the road in the middle of nowhere to do a bit of bike maintenance and within 5 minutes I'd have a crowd of people standing around and watching. That got a little old, since I always felt like I had to keep an eye on my stuff when random people were crowding around.  One on one people are usually honest enough, but when you get the anonymity of a crowd things can get weird.\n\nI kept up to date with my friends back home with Facebook, email, and text messages.  It was nice to get back to Europe after Asia though, where I could actually puzzle out signs with my high school French and native English."

"No problem!\n1. The top tube is the horizontal tube that runs from the seat tube to the head tube (it's the one on top). You can correct for a short top tube to some extent with a longer stem.\n\n2. The standover height will be a serious concern, it's pretty miserable to ride a bike that is too tall. It's hard to mount and dismount, it's tricky standing on one foot at a light, and it will tend to feel unstable.\n\n3. Some of those dimensions seem a little whack.. At your height I'd say 58cm is at the top end of what's appropriate, with your long upper body it may be good to go with the larger size. 54-56cm would be ideal. I wouldn't get too worried about this printout. With your dimensions you'd probably need a custom frame to match what they're talking about. Ideally you should be able get a good saddle to pedal distance (leg fully extended at bottom of pedal stroke) with 15-20cm of seatpost showing. That's about the best guide I can give for a CL buy\n\nHope that helps, and good luck!"

"Your local bicycle shop.(LBS)\n\nGo in and talk to one of the people that works there and tell them exactly what you just asked us. Hopefully they should be able to point you in the direction of a bicycle for recreational riding. \n\nTake a couple of bikes for a test ride, and see what feels the best and is most comfortable to you.

"Start with a price range and a kind of riding you want to do. So you know, decent new bicycles these days are not cheap. A cheap bicycle can turn biking into a chore, so it's really worth your time to make a good initial investment. Here's a rough breakdown of the price categories you're looking at for new bikes.\n\nLess than 500: forget about it. Mostly department store trash. Best to start looking on Craigslist or saving up\n\n500-750: Some decent entry-level hybrids and commuters can occur here, especially if you keep an eye out for sales\n\n750-1000: Generally decent entry-level bikes which will perform well and last you many years\n\n1000-1500: Many good entry-level bikes. At this point you can start looking into decent road bikes/touring/cyclocross bikes. These bikes will perform well (good shifting and braking) generally be more specialized to a task, and will last a long time.\n\n1500+: Getting out of entry-level and into the nicer stuff. Must of the changes in this price range won't be too meaningful to a beginner. \n\nWhen I started getting into cycling I was surprised by the prices, but you really do get what you pay for, with huge returns on investment up to the first 1500. \n\nAnyways, some good places to look are always your local bike shops. Try to find one with friendly people who will take the time to talk to you without trying to sell you something right away. Ideally try to find a shop that does custom bikes, rather than off-the shelf racers. They're more likely to be interested in what you want and to give you honest advice.\n\nSome of my favorite bands which offer very solid bikes at reasonable prices are [surly](http://surlybikes.com/), [All City](http://allcitycycles.com/), and [soma](http://www.somafab.com/)"

"It is a decent deal. I was eyeing that thing for a while. I got him down to $250.\n\nDefinitely not stolen. It is an old entry level bike. In chicago market not worth more than $250, so $250 is pretty reasonable."
"Definitely, the bottom of the bars should be flat or tilted slightly back. But it also looks like the brake levers are a bit too high up. The ends of the levers should be in a line with the bottom of the bars. If he makes both adjustments, it should be a lot more comfortable."
"$20-50 in its current condition at best\n\nNot worth restoring if you are trying to sell it."
"It's a cannondale, probably an sr500, from 1987 or 88 if I had to guess. Came with Shimano 105 components. Good stuff.\n\nAssuming it's in decent condition it's a great bike, and a real steal at that price. In Vancouver it would easily get two or three times that. "
"I booked my flight out of San Francisco in advance, since I needed to be at Burning Man and then Yosemite for specific dates I was willing to commit to a date to leave the country.  I hadn't originally planned to fly out of HK, so I bought that one with very little notice.  Flying from London to Washington I wasn't willing to commit to a date until I was a few weeks away from London just so I could be reasonably sure I'd arrive in time to make my flight.\n\nI didn't have any issues with visibility.  Nobody has trouble seeing the lines on the side of the road, and I'm significantly taller than they are.  I've literally ridden thousands of miles both with and without a flag as well.  The only difference I've noticed is that when I don't have a flag everyone I talk to tells me I need a flag.\n\nCyclists need to carry mechanical gear for repairs along the way, which accounts for some of it.  Long distance tourists especially.  Clothing accounts for another chunk since we'll go from mountain passes to deserts and need to handle a wide array of climates, and need enough clothes to go for a few days without washing it (often very sweaty days).  Also, since we're rolling on wheels there's not as much push to minimize everything.  Instead of making do with a tarp we'll often splurge on a two person tent.  Instead of camping alone in a forest we might be camping out in an unused ball park.  I once even spent the night on the front lawn of the city hall.  Having a little privacy for ablutions and clothes changes makes the added bulk and weight worthwhile.  Touring cyclists are also a pretty weird bunch.  Everyone has their own personalized necessities.  I ran into one guy hauling an old 70's style folding aluminum lawn chair with him over a mountain since he really wanted a nice chair to sit on every night in camp.  The Japanese guy is a special case.  He's effectively living off his bike.  After 10 years he's not just a tourist anymore.  All that gear is most likely everything he owns.  When you think about it that way it's not as strange to see so much.  It's also easy to over pack on a bike.  There's a joke among bike tourists that everyone sends home a box after the first week on the road.  Even with a dozen tours under my belt I mailed home a box at the start of this trip.  Not a big box, but I still did it.\n"
"Lovely. If the bars feel uncomfortable, you might want to try rotating them a bit, so that the lower part of them is more parallel to the ground"
"It looks like a good deal to me. I would take a close look at the frame and wheels. As long as it's straight and it fits, I would go for it. The ad says it needs tires, be sure to consider that in your budget/offer. "
"Do not get aksiums. They are not an upgrade. The best lightweight wheels for the money are vuelta corsa lite for $250 shipped. They are better than ksyriums and cheaper. \n\nAs for group set, 105s or SRAM apex are both very good choices. "
"Your in the area? Have you seen this bike in person then?"
"you got a better deal than I got on my 2014 CAAD10 105. Shit."
"Awesome!  I appreciate the help.  \n\nPrices do seem expensive but I am expecting that.  I was originally thinking around $500 but I have about a $1000 budget to work with.  I was just doing some reading and Hybrids seem to be what I want to look at."
"handlebar angle looks too aggressive for your hoods to do you any good, roll them back and reseat your brake levers.  sweet frame, piece of history."
"It's the same as about 2 water bottles according to him and it's too much! I like the no disc but where is the electric shifting?"
"It looked like he was on di2 when they showed the bike on the start in Baal today.  I wonder if they have a mech bike built as a backup and photo prop."
"I say neither. Running behind as the child learns to balance should only take a day or two. Training wheels often stay on for months and don't really teach any riding skills. I wouldn't buy a balance bike for the couple of days it should take to learn to balance."
"Me and my underwear have noticed this. Do you see the plastic thing on the seat tube? It's a small fitting for a MTB style mudguard. It's actually removable and you can carry it in a backpack."
"Cool, thanks very much for the info! I guess if they are happy to carry the extra gear than that's fine! Me, I still think I'd have a *lot* less than that 10-year guy! But yeah, I'm an ultra-minimalist at home too :)"

"Bolt on dewi (DUI) bars! "

Hoping to get away next summer, so that gives me a good bit of time to do some preparation. Thanks again! "
"Brilliant, Just subbed it! Thanks!"
"Yes, I suspect it might be harder to find very small frames too. Most manufactures do make 62cm or similar frames, they are just sold in lower quantities."
"My wife initially was looking at hybrids. I had her test ride a road bike just for fun. She loved it and couldn't see any point in a hybrid after that. If she wants comfort she uses the top of the bars or the hoods. After a few weeks on the road bike she decided to train for a tri. Now, she has tri bars on it.\nSummary: Depending on your future possibilities, you may want to consider trying a road bike."
"Can't with those levers. I'd definitely shorten your cable housing though."
"The position where the cable comes out of the brake lever, would make running it under the tape slightly awkward."
"if you want a brand new saddle, go with a fizik arione.\n\nyou can probably find some deals on your local craigslist for some fizik stuff or some solid older selle san marco or selle italia saddles just like this one has."
"Totally! Hybrids are nice because they're pretty comfy and there's a minimal learning curve, they work on a variety of terrains and are reasonably efficient. That said, don't be too intimidated by bikes with drop bars (the kind that curve down). They're not just for road racers, they add a lot of options for hand positions so they can be very comfy and they don't take long to get used to. Bikes in this category are often road bikes, cyclocross bikes (very fun, fast bikes, which can be ridden hard off-road), and touring bikes. \n\nI find that the best bang for your buck in terms of versatility and fun is to search craigslist for a good used cyclocross bike. Modern cross bikes haven't been around that long so you're unlikely to get stuck with an old clunker. They're also fast, fun, and nigh-indestructible. Some good ones to look out for in this range used are the Kona Jake or the Fuji Cross. Also, be sure to get one that fits! [This](http://www.ebicycles.com/bicycle-tools/frame-sizer) should serve as a rough guide for size.\n\nGood luck, and happy hunting!\n"

"I learned on training wheels.  My dad installed them very high.  They were about two inches off the ground and I could lean either direction several degrees.  This taught me how to balance and pedal without worrying about falling over."

"I managed a bike shop for a year (last year incidentally). Mostly the frames we purchased (not a lot thankfully since that meant building a bike to some lunatics specs) were either very large or small frames which were hard to come by, as opposed to off shelf bicycles which were mostly median sized (48-56 id say)."
"Hey, I have one of those!\n\nStan's Arch EX rims (and 9mm/10mm through axle hubs), 1x10, wide riser bars and an 80mm stem and it's a completely different animal. Completely slays berms, rock gardens and the occasional jump. Fantastic geometry."
"I'm not cool, so I just left the seat post reflector on and set that on top of the collar and wham, exactly where I wanted it. I think a metallic sharpie would work but I'd hate for it to wear off and not have it perfect, like you said "
"Looks like it- that part of the rim is parallel to the centerline of the wheel, rather than being shaped (does that description make any sense?)  It looks like | |  at the edge, rather than \\ / like it is on the aero portion.  The stickers are placed exactly underneath that section, too.  It also definitely feels machined!  I imagine that once you wore the anodizing off, it'd be fine."
"Oh, good point!  I wish I had some better photos for them, though..."
"Not surprised, as those are the people who would benefit most from building up their own bike.\n\nThat said, when I was talking about buying frames I was really referring to what's on the second hand market; which obviously can have of come from a  complete bike or just bought on it's own."
"Good deal on some awesome looking wheels. "

"Yup, it's the freehub pawls.\n\nMy friend had a wheel go completely, so he put it on Pinkbike for £10 as an 'Anti-fixie joke wheel'."

"I've scratched a groove into the alloy of the seatpost, but it still takes quite a lot of trial and error to get it exact. "
"Ride 6800. It's seriously impressive. I'd take 6800 over 9070 any day of the week."
"I saw one of these go for 600$ on my local CL. What'd you pay out of curiosity? (obviously 600$ is pretty high)"
"I think that's what I'm gonna do. Plus weld a stand for some small speakers on the back fender and cruise around bumping my jams"
"Stealth camping is what cycle tourists call camping on the side of the road without permission. You find someplace out of the way, cover anything reflective, don't have a fire, and leave the place better than when you arrived. The idea is that if you don't get caught it's not a big deal. Generally the worst that happens if you're caught is that you're told to move along. You also hear stories of police telling people not to camp where they're at because there's a better place somewhere else. Once I even heard of someone waking up to find a note on their tent inviting them in for breakfast at a nearby house. Obviously every place is different, but there are always folks riding all the way across the US without spending a dime on shelter. Personally I'd rather spend a little cash here and there in exchange for convenience, but everyone has their own preferred way of traveling. "
"I didn't say I didn't eat it did I? And jello, that's disgusting even if it wasn't made of boiled pig skin and bones. "
"I'll definitely make some adjustments, thanks for pointing that out.\n"
"Haha yes that too, I went for a really nice frame as a priority and worked down from there with the intention of replacing some parts early this year"
"Just because he had no conventional brakes doesn't mean that's what caused their death."
"The shop had it priced at $350. I actually traded a .22 rifle for it which was only worth about $200."
"In my city at least fixies are still popular, just it seems so are cyclocross bikes too. It rains a  lot in my city, so the prospect of having less parts to clean an maintain is appealing to many."
"I like how that guy just stood there until the moose got up to him, then all slick and casual like slipped over to the other side of the rail.  "
"The appeal of the brakeless fixies is twofold. \n\n 1. They are about as simple as a bike can be. very little maintenance.\n 2. From a riding point of view I guess not having bikes puts you \"in tune\" with your bike, if you want to go slower you have to alter your cadence."

"Thank you!  It did sound very freeTEMPO-ish, which was why the song caught my interest. "

Then you can get them pedaling with training wheels so they understand how that motion works. But start with the balance bike."
"I sell most of them on craigslist or eBay to fund new bikes. "

"Oh man that's something sweet... I'd love an early carbon bike myself... what's the ride like?"

"You're preaching to the choir here on that one"
"Australian drivers are very impatient. They will put a cyclists life at risk, just to save a few seconds off their drive. Most cycling accidents in Australia are a hit from behind, because drivers are too impatient to wait a few seconds to overtake safely. Australian Truck drivers are often the best drivers on the road, as the understand the need to wait a few seconds, until it is safe to overtake. They know that if they hit or cause a near miss to a cyclist, their career is over, and therefore do not take risks like other drivers."
"Damn, you got a good deal. The shop I was working was selling your bike for 1350 POUNDS. Nice one man!"
"Rumble strips? how are cyclists meant to overtake each other?"
"Healed my damned rotator cuff tear and was able to ride 3 miles without stopping.\n\n(grrrrr)\n\nEdit: and learned you can't eat like a bike commuter while driving your car to work every day.  I'm now 60 lbs overweight. "
"Yeah!  Go man, go!!!"
"damn that's some self-control this guy's showing.. \"just two *giant* animals, no biggie. just leaning here on the rails, nothing to bother..\"\n\n"
