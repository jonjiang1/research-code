"One of the purpose of bots is to \"visit\" sites to increase their page views. There is one malware currently going around that appears to visit different websites in the back ground.

"This is not the first old infection that I have seen. I came across Worm:Win32/Gamarue.i (I am not sure whether I got the spelling and variant right). The microsoft article on it is from 2001.

Some people seems to be reusing the old codes.\n\nI guess the arrests that have been happening has reduced the usual malwares."

I hear about different ones occasionally and I always thought it was just a set of tools that were a systems' core or something?"
"&gt; You can easily mute sounds from specific processes. I suspect it wouldn't be hard to send over a portable browser, mute it, and play some videos in the background.\n\nOn the infected computer, it was a rootkit, so the process was hidden so it can't be individually muted. The malware creator could have muted the sound, but he/she didn't. You could also use the existing browser and run it hidden through the rootkit. If you just need pageviews, you don't even need a browser. You can request the page using specific user agents even without a browser.\n\n&gt; Also, what about ad-redirecting mods?

"Consider the audience reading the application. It will not likely be a computer scientist unless you are writing a letter to get directly into a netsec degree program. If it is for a general application to get into college, consider using neutral terms for your skill set. I wouldn't say I'm a white hat hacker; rather, I would say that I have done security testing for web administrators and describe what the benefits are to organizations you have helped. It will be impressive and will get the point across to someone who may not know the lingo. "

"~DOXING~\nDoxing is a technique of tracing someone or gather information about an individual using sources on the internet. Its name is derived from “Documents” or “Docx”. Doxing method is based purely on the ability of the hacker to recognize valuable information about his target and use this information to his benefit. It is also based around the idea that, “The more you know about your target, the easier it will be to find his or her flaws”\n\nExample:\nWell yeah, he is saying he is doxing me and he talked about one of my youtube channels (he's never talked to me before)\n\n(Credit goes to Urban Dictionary) :)"
"swatting is just a despicable thing to do to someone. It wastes money, it wastes time, it frightens people, and it abuses services setup to help people."
"Yeah, spycraft would probably be the right way to put it.  The reason I'm asking is because I would like to have actual record and proof of everything and in certain situations, I couldn't openly have a camera out. Obviously I'm familiar with the James Bond tools like hidden cameras, which would be very useful, but they also carry the risk of being uncovered fairly easily. So I guess things like running the computer's mic without anything being noticed.\n\nI know the best answer would be to start from the ground up and learn the basics of security, which I'm working on now, but since I only have ~1 year, I don't have the freedom to really dive into the field and learn everything properly.  I'm currently familiarizing myself with Kali linux and picked up a book on Metasploit, so I guess I'm just asking for other recommendations along the lines of those two that people think would be useful.  For all I know, there are 'detective' packages out there with a collection of tools I'm looking for. \n\nI'd also like to point out that currently, I'm not familiar with all the national laws of the country, but from what I've been able to gather, they don't have extensive rules in this area. I would like to try and keep my work in the legal area since it gives a fair amount of leeway. But obviously all of that is on me."
