"Nice. I've been doing cardio at the end for the last couple of days now. \n\nTypically when I do cardio first, my pulse is elevated and I feel like I have more energy when I stop and hit the machine floor. Hitting the floor at the beginning has been an interesting feeling. It feels raw like I'm not \"prepared\" for the exertion at first, but as I work from machine to machine my pulse raises and that feeling drops off. \n\nBy the time I get to the elliptical and treadmill, I've done my core and that seems to help me keep myself erect which helps keep my state of mind in the right place so I'm not sulking. If today is an upper day, them I have the added benefit of the upper reinforcement. Feels like I'm more in control while running and less like something I just want to get over with. \n\nI think my overall routine is quicker as well. I could take an hour and a half to two hours before but with this arrangement it take about an hour.. give or take. I think doing the cardio first takes away immediate energy and leaves me moving slower while on the floor. \n\nIn any case, it's been a nice change of routine and feels different which feels good. Thanks for the simple switchup advice. "

Granted, there are more than a few other guys in his weight class who are even stronger than him, but make no mistake: 180lbs reasonably lean and 5'7 is absolutely jacked.\n\n"

"I definitely see what you are saying, but for example put Phil and George Leeman side by side shirt off without any knowledge of who the two are. I think most people (including myself) would pick Phil strictly due to leanness, and I might even think George looked fat and lazy. We all know Leeman is a beast when you see him lift and when he was shredded, he looked absolutely enormous. Leanness can be extremely deceptive when it comes to strength. "
"I wanted to add to your post. \n\nNOTE: the below info is my opinion only. Also, I get my supplements for free, which is part of the reason why I take some things that I say you probably don't need. \n\nMost supplements are bs. Do you need bcaa's? Chances are you're getting (enough of) them from your protein/diet. That being said, if I haven't eaten and go work out, I take them (re:fasted). Does it work? Well, it makes my water taste good. Again, I take them because I get them free.  But even then, I don't really workout fasted often \n\nPre workouts will vary greatly. Some people react way differently than others. My personal favorite was original formula jack3d (dmaa was fun). Most preform outs have beta-alanine which can cause a \"pringly\" sensation (known as parenthesia). Niacin can cause niacin flush.  Caffeine/sugars both cause jitters. Some people DO NOT like these side affects. personally, I find a cup of coffee (re:caffeine pills) go a LONG way. \n\nAs far as protein goes, I like cheap whey (Isolate).  I get mine from costco - I like Optimun Nutrition because theirs has generally blended the best/tasted the best *for me*. Is there a difference between isolate/concentrate/casein/etc? Not really. Some people have digestive issues (I get major gas when I take concentrate). \n\nThe big thing, like the guy above me said, is eat at a surplus. Hope this helps some. \n\nEdit: creatine: get creatine monohydrate. Take 5g a day errday and don't worry about it ever again."

"I've made quite a few observations having just overcome this SAME thing myself while trying to shove down 4000 calories a day....\n\nFirst off --- I've found timing, water consumption, and \"choice of food\" has helped me a ton.... you don't have to eat a HUGE ass meal to meet macros and stay in the \"healthy food\" category. I take a cup of coffee in the morning (black) and chug it down, which seems to get my metabolism jump started pretty damn good. \n\n\nI eat a huge breakfast (1000 calories/ 50g's+ protein/ 50+ carbs), then for a snack I'll hit around 500 calories (guacamole, peanut butter, some  greek yogurt), then lunch is less calories but high protein (turkey sandwich and a \"shake\" which is really just a scoop mixed in 4oz's of water), protein bar 2 hrs before workout, then post workout \"shake\" and a fucking MANLY ass dinner....\n\n\nJust, my point is, maybe rethink what all you are eating and rethink the \"cost-vs-value\" and rethink when you take in super filling meals. I will only drink a gainer shake as a before workout meal, directly after one, or right before bed. \n\n\nPerhaps some of that made sense?\n\nAnyway - Last bit - I started treating eating itself as a workout! \"1 more! 1 MORE!!! 1 MORE BITE\" Ya know, psych myself up.

Sure enough, my left elbow is the bad one, and the one I make underhand during deadlifts.\n\n2) During curls, DO NOT curl the hands and forearms up. Keep a straight line from wrists right through hands.\n\nOn the other hand, your issue may be totally unrelated to all this, but was hoping I might share some of my recent findings..\n\n"

"Do lots of heavy deadlifts/barbell rows. The bigger your lats/back get the less of a problem your wide hips will be.\n\nAlso, a picture of your torso/hips would help.

"When I was skinny I had the hourglass torso as well.  You need to gain a bunch of muscle so that your stomach and back are proportional to your hips."

"This article proposes very interesting ideas. I like the comparison between religion and gym going. In the middle of the article the author presents engaging thoughts about reasons behind gym going, ex. g. \"horrendous perfectionism\" and \"gym bunnies.\" However, at the end the author sounds like he/she has no idea what he/she is writing about. I am myself a regular gym goer and the conclusions made by the author I disagree with. For instance, I quote \"gyms are numbingly bad for your mind.\" That really is not the case and depends on the person. I quote again \"There is some evidence to support the view that working out, and other forms of body-anxiety, may be sicknesses of affluence—driven by unreasonable and unachievable expectations about where the rowing machine can take you.\" \"Some\" is a very ambiguous word. This article shall not be taken seriously for it calumniates working out and going to the gym. It is an opinion of a single person who seems  to have an unpleasant experience with fitness. Nevertheless, this article is worth reading once for its interesting reasoning and ideas."

Yet there was plenty of guys lifting less weight and making low grunt sounds and the occasional bitch hiss, which bothered no one. That's why I'm thinking there could be a volume or style issue that could be ticking off people in your gym. In either case, training hard does require consistent grunts or screaming.\n\nYou wouldn't want to be stuck on a bus next to a guy screaming into his cell phone the entire ride, but if he was only talking on the phone that would be expected. Your screaming is probably outside of acceptable levels.\n\n\n\n"

When cutting I go for bulk food with lower calories as feel fuller. Brocolli is a good example. Broccoli dont exactly taste fantastic, edible but no desert.\n\nI saw a vid on youtube cant remember who it was (Wendler?) and they say unless you going to compete be a bit more leniant.

"&gt; That is why the SL program doesn't do them very often and has them at the end of the workout\n\nthat is **a** reason, but the real reason is because the squat is the more technically demanding lift and it is already being done heavy 3x per week. noob or not you can't easily train squat and deadlift both heavy with that frequency."
"**case** - two weeks prior to a show, a female competitor goes on an extreme cut (white fish &amp; greens only) with cardio everyday...post competition doesn't feel well, etc [haha, no shit]\n\n**refeeding syndrome** - you refeed your body with vast amounts of carbs which causes \"many problems\"...your body is not used to releasing lots of insulin, and then it suddenly does...after two days of refeeding, your serum mineral/electrolyte levels get depleted during the carb refeed which cause \"severe problems\" throughout your body (he discusses this concept ad nauseam)...treatment of refeeding syndrome: step 1, avoid severe dieting to begin with (cut with as many cals and carbs as possible), step 2 go to a hospital for proper treatment \n"
"I have like 10 stretch mark tight together on my lower back, about 4-5 inches long each, they look like I've been hit really deep with a whip or something.\n\nI've had them for about 5 years now (since I was 16 or 17 I believe), they sort of came out of nowhere as far as I'm able to tell (my weight was stagnant during that period). They used to bother me since I first got a remark about them in the locker room and didn't really have any idea why I had those things on me, but today if anyone notices them I either tell them I got them while battling a lion, or that I got them from your mom while balls deep (depending on the situation), and it's honestly so far off my mind."

(Grilled chicken breast w/o bun, veggies, salad etc). Ground beef (hamburger) w/o bun, steak. There are lots of options. \n\nI gotta tell you, it's a heck of a lot easier trying to figure this all out when it's just the two of you. Just wait till you have kids. The exhaustion &amp; limitless supply of snacks (fruit snacks, crackers etc) is beyond tempting. You can't give chicken &amp; rice to your kids day after day (well, I suppose you could but...) \n\nOh well. I'm rambling. It would not be cool of you to say \"if you this, then that..\" To me, that seems like you are giving your wife an ultimatum. That...just won't end up well for either of you."

That is a pretty strong endorsement.\n\nRumours of who GH15 is are always going to be around but it shouldn't matter who the guy is. He puts out good information and people following his principals make fantastic progress.\n\nThe guy doesn't have an agenda and just wants to spread the truth. He actively fights against narcotics and those who sell lies and take advantage of those who don't know any better. The guy has done lots for bodybuilding and also has done lots for dog charities. The hate for him tends to come from that and misinformation and rumours spread, drug dealers and con artists don't like being robbed of their profits."

"From the BNF:\nSide-effects of the SSRIs include gastro-intestinal effects (dose-related and fairly common—include nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, abdominal\npain, diarrhoea, constipation), anorexia with weight loss (increased appetite and weight gain also reported) and hypersensitivity reactions including rash (consider discontinuation—may be sign of impending\nserious systemic reaction, possibly associated with vasculitis),\nurticaria, angioedema, anaphylaxis, arthralgia, myalgia and photosensitivity; other side-effects include dry mouth, nervousness, anxiety, headache, insomnia, tremor, dizziness, asthenia, hallucinations, drowsiness, convulsions, galactorrhoea, sexual dysfunction, urinary retention, sweating, hypomania or mania, movement disorders and\ndyskinesias, visual disturbances, hyponatraemia, and bleeding disorders including ecchymoses and purpura. Suicidal behaviour has been linked with antidepressants. Angle-closure glaucoma may very rarely be precipitated by treatment with SSRIs.\n\nHope that answers your question for you. The BNF is the British National Formulary so the big book of drugs in the UK, its a medical reference book used by Dr's, pharmacists etc. I would like to add this version is a few years old though I doubt any real change has occurred in terms of discovered sides."

"I'm sitting at my computer shirtless, and I only wore gym shorts all day. No shame."
"No. My understanding is a raised heel will put you at a mechanical disadvantage for a dead lift, which is why a lot of people dead lift barefoot. I personally use Vibrams for dead lifts.\n\nWeightlifting shoes are great for squats (including all variations), clean &amp; jerk, and snatch. I've read comments from people saying they use them for standing overhead press as well. I guess they really like the stability of the shoe for that exercise."
