" Essentially there is no difference between what is called a \"blog\" or an e-commerce site. Both are websites and its just the content that makes them a blog or e-commerce site. \n\n I would not change this at all. People know the site, you are making money from it and changing it would be detrimental to your business.\n\n The content can be changed to your hearts content, no need for a new name."

"Owner/operator/employee/^andeverythingelse of a (premium) janitorial service for 5 years now. \n\n* You want general liability insurance.\n* My contracts are month to month (automatically rolling over), some businesses do year long. Decide for yourself how long of period you want your contract to cover.\n* Figure out how you are going to invoice and keep track of $$$^^1\n* Between the two of you, who is responsible for what?^^2\n* Who are you marketing to and how are you going to market? I prefer commercial office spaces of that are either VERY dirty (construction/warehouse) or VERY clean (engineering firm).\n* Where are you purchasing your supplies. Costco has good prices, and you *can* buy in bulk, however why spend X amount of $ for Costco's fancy TP when you can go to Waxie (or some other distributor) and get simple 2-ply (but still friendly to the butthole) TP. \n* **I can NOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH** ALL supplies that your client wants you to buy or that you have to buy to service them **MUST BE** invoiced separately. Sure, markup on the price a little, but keep your SUPPLIES from your HOURS WORKED separate.^^3\n\nI'm sure I have more, but brain power is running away from me.\n\n\n1) I would strongly suggest getting an accountant right on the get go. Of course this depends on how much $$$ you have to start up, but getting someone reliable, knowledgeable, and specialized for all things accountant and taxes will help you out incredibly. Shop around for a good accountant though, I made that mistake and it was..exhausting. I send my account my bank statements every 3 months, she send me my quarterly tax paperwork for me to sign and write a check to the big Gov. My accountant also set up my quickbooks invoicing so it can be mostly automated. \n\n2) I would also strongly suggest you incorporate (s-corp) or atleast LLC. Either way get some protection up between yourselves and yourselves and your personal property. \n\n3) All my contracts I have just given a monthly estimate on what it takes to clean, manage supplies, and go and purchase supplies. That is retardation. Although I still make a profit, it makes no sense for my clients to not have to pay specifically for their TP, paper towels, and soap. \n\nAnyhow, that's it. Good luck."

"I'm surprised you don't want to get worker's comp.  Employees are generally pretty incompetent even when it comes to simple things such as not cutting themselves.  You really don't want to end up with the medical bills these people can get themselves into."
"I have no employees.\n\nEdit: I have no employees, SO and I taken advantage of legal loopholes so we make good money. We might hire in 2014 or a later date. Until then no need for worker's comp."
"Oh I see, yeah I have lots of employees :(.  I mean they're good people and generally they're pretty good, but holy crap, sometimes I just, I don't know.  The worst is they're harming themselves, I mean it's like I buy you guys safety equipment, USE IT FOR GOD SAKE."

"In the same industry? I have circled the drain on hiring for a while now, and we are just coming up to being able to afford an employee, but I want to know the approximate cost to hire an employee. "
"Dude, I started a cleaning business over a year ago, along with 20 other fellow Redditors. Head over to /r/EntrepreneurRideAlong  You'll be amazed by the information there. "
"Heh, no restaurant.  So it's quite impossible for me to not have employees.  While having an employee is great, I warn you it is also a huge burden.  Even at minimum wage, with everything you need to cover you're realistically looking at $15/hr per employee.  It's actually worse if you only have one employee since having workers comp is more expensive with only one person.  :("

"Trello and Asana are great tools."
"Great answer, RoyAwesomesStepDad!"
"Meh. \n\nMost companies have a culture of inconsistent contradictions. Same with brand messaging: Flailing about aimlessly. \n\nIf one company in one thousand gets the integration between branding and culture, they are not letting anyone in on it. The ability to do anything -- at all -- about culture might as well be rocket science. \n\nConsequently many companies have a culture of internal and external propaganda designed to mask the actual culture. Really they should quiz any manager using this term on how precisely you execute any of these fine sounding points, anybody who hasn't an answer gets fired. \n\nMost companies don't have cultures so much as syndromes of related, self-reinforcing dysfunctions. Just as most companies do not have functional brands, just a thing that fills in a blank space in the corner of correspondence. \n\nThat is one way to staunch the dominant culture of superficial nonsense, addition to meaningless buzzwords that are not actionable, and abject faddism in corporate America today. "
"What are the benefits?"
"[deleted]"
"Create a culture. After that it is easy enough to reward people who exemplify it and pointedly ignore people when they go against it or disregard it. If you want to be really active about it then you can actually cultivate your workforce to match it.\n\nThis starts with something as simple as a mission statement. If you don't have one then start thinking about it. There has to be a reason, other than money, that you do what you do. Figure out that reason and then make sure everyone understands it and agrees with it, exemplifies it.\n\nIt sounds hokey maybe but I can guarantee it works. It's true that people just need jobs and they'll work purely for money but it's also true that people want to be a part of something bigger and you can make your workforce happier and more productive if you give them something bigger to work towards.\n\nUnrelated to the above, employee performance and satisfaction goes up when employees feel like their contributions are valuable and valued. Share some of your decision making process with them, perhaps in meetings, and invite their feedback. Maybe you want to add some benefit but you aren't sure what you can afford or what they would most desire - 401k matching or year-end bonuses or some sort of healthcare assistance perhaps. So just tell them that; tell them you want to help them out, you aren't sure how best to do it, and you'd like ideas. Make it clear the final decision is still yours of course; it's a business decision after all. Or perhaps you have a problematic customer, they pay well but make the staff miserable. Sit down with your people and have a frank discussion about whether or not to fire the client - what kind of misery will we put up with, on behalf of the team, for this revenue? Give them real numbers and be prepared to hear things you didn't expect and can use.\n\nI use both of these and am certain they contribute to better performance and lower turnover. In my business my talent is key to my deliverable and expensive to replace so it is especially valuable to me to know how to make them happy."
"Make them plan out what they want to accomplish in the next year.\n\nThen review.\n\nRepeat."
"That would be a good idea, I would also recommend the same and it's the surest way."
"I would make sure you build value in your business, i.e. If you sell your business you can sell your business relationships too.\n\nMany of our VARs are small and they often do not thing about their exit strategy."
"I disagree, have a look at WinWeb, we have anything you'll need to run you business online and your back-office, all nicely integrated.\n\nData Fragmentation = Business Fragmentation.\n\nYou will end up in a situation where you don't know where your data is and if it is correct."
"What frequency have you found the reviews to be best?"
"I think that an annual cycle of \"Plan out your goals/Review progress\" with a monthly \"touching base\" agenda item during regular weekly status meetings works as well as anything.   That way, it doesn't get put aside for 11 months and then get short-shrift as people try to catch-up/game the process.."
"By the time review rolls around if anything is a surprise then you are doing ti wrong.  When employees are not performing to your expectations, you have to handle it asap and correct.  If they are over performing, then you should rewarding even when not review time is around.  \n\nThat's it.  Either over performing or not performing to expectations.  You need to instill the culture you expect and inspect often."
"That is so old style of office work which results in total BS."
"I'm kind of curious what type of business you are running to require these things. No negativity, I'm legitimately curious! Thanks!"
"As a former minimum wage employee who moved into lower management before quitting, I can tell you your gesture was great. A company party and gift cards would've made my day! Even 10 on amazon can get you some cool stuff from china. Good job! Next year consider a secret Santa too. It gets the employees more involved with one another! \n\nI can only hope the business I'm opening can have some type of culture to warrant bonuses and a party!"
"I feel like everyone here is giving you negativity. You are entering a market you know is bad, and I respect that... I do have a little positive advice for you, however... You want to be a non profit, and raise awareness for a disease you have, and are therefor (assuming) passionate about.... Do you know who appreciates non profits raising awareness for a cause?\n\nOther non profits. \n\nI was a manager at one of the worlds largest YMCAs and I can't tell you how often small time entrepreneurs would be allowed, at no cost, to set up a stand for one or two weeks in the patio area with stuff for sale to raise awareness and support. They'll even promote you via mass emails. People who willingly pay extra to work out at a non profit organization are more willing to support your cause. Also, seniors who are now generally wealthy from being an entrepreneur may see something in you and offer you additional support and connections.\n\nTake that idea and run with it. Create some flyers and information boards and start running to your local y or farmers market director. \n\nStay classy. "

"Why podcast, just youtube! I would rather watch and listen than just listen. "
"If you're going to have a mission statement, make sure it's not divorced from reality and is something people can really get behind. At the company I work for (I have a small business on the side) there is a mission statement that is contrary to my goals (it states the company's goal is to benefit a group of people I'm not in) and a list of \"core values\" that nobody, especially not management, bothers to try to live up to. If you're going to have stuff like that and blatantly ignore it, it makes things worse than if you had nothing at all because it makes management look hypocritical (do as I say, not as I do)."
