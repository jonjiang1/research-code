"Repetition of a word is a form of mindfulness.  It is a form of samatha similar to mindfulness of the breath.\n\nThe principle is to focus on 1 object (in this case, a mantra) to anchor the mind down to 1 place to prevent it from being pulled here and there by scattered thoughts.  It prevents the mind's energy from being dissipated in different directions out into our 6 senses.\n\nIn the [Chappana Sutta](http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn35/sn35.206.than.html), the Buddha explained it as if we caught 6 different animals and tied each animal to a central knot.  The animals would each want to go in whatever direction they wanted - the net result is it will go in the direction of the strongest animal.\n\nOur minds are the same - they'll want to go in the direction of the strongest sense pleasure or away from the strongest sense unpleasantness.\n\nBut if instead, we tie the animals to a stake in the middle, each of those animals will try to run off initially, but in the end, they'll lay down where they are.\n\nHaving something to anchor the mind in this way is similar and prevents your energy from being dissipated out."

"The seventh precept (which is part of the Eight Precepts) is not to be observed except for uposatha days, IIRC, so it's not that Buddhist laypeople can't sing or dance (in regular days only the Five Precepts are observed). I'm sure you know this already, but some may not, so I'm just putting it out there. Also, CMIIW.\n\nIMO the key is in the word \"entertainment\". To try to sever clinging and at the same time indulge in \"entertainment\" isn't very congruent.."
"&gt; What can be said about it other than that it is a tremendously sad thing, really? And what value comes from stating that?\n\nI think there is a great deal of value in that. Clearly it doesnt take away the sadness or the pain, but it does help us develop a more sane relationship with it. In the same way that noting the unsatisfying quality of impermanent phenomenon doesnt make things any more satisfying, but does, over time, help to improve our relationship with it. Among other things, just talking about this straightforwardly helps to take away the stigma, so family doesnt have to bear this kind of thing so alone. (Not that I think his family are particularly affected by anything we do here, but in general, developing a new way of relating to this helps others who will be in similar circumstances.) Of course if his family were actually asking for privacy, I would certainly think that is appropriate, but I dont see any evidence that they care at all. The fact is that this information was originally shared publicly by one of his friends."
"For me, the big question is whether the person will be receptive to what I have to say. Most often, people just get defensive and learn nothing. In those cases, its better to just let it pass over. But in the few cases where you can help someone by saying something which will be temporarily discomforting for them... sure, go for it."
"I am not trying to judge his integrity, in fact I have no reason to doubt it, and Im quite sorry if I gave that impression, but as for speculating on his agenda, I dont consider that speculation really: it emerges fairly clearly if you observe the general themes and thrust of his discussion, and he was more or less explicit about it at certain points. And I consider it a completely appropriate subject since it gives my sense of what this person's work (here) was about, just as I would expect anyone commemorating me to give some sense of how I approached life."
"&gt;There were exactly zero gratuitous insults.\n\n\"Zero insults\" isn't exactly the same thing as being considerate and tactful, though.\n\n&gt;Should I have apologized and/or dropped it or pushed on?\n\nIf you really did what you thought **they** needed to hear, why is this still a question?"

"It's because your mind gets absorbed into the sensory realm - the realm of the senses (in this case, auditory pleasure and visual pleasure), which is only gives us a finite amount of happiness.  Once they go, we spend our lives seeking them again and again - because we don't know any better.\n\nBy letting go of it on observance days, it can give us a glimpse of something better, more peaceful and sublime than the sensory realm."
"&gt;he did take his own life\n\nI apologize ahead of time if you were a close personal friend or relative, I'm just a very silent lurker and absorber of knowledge, but when his passing was announced, the person who posted the information (and knew how he died) requested that the family's privacy be respected in regards to this info. Perhaps maybe this is not the best wording or way of introducing this topic, I feel it kind of makes a spectacle of a beloved Buddhitor who this sub has only recently lost... It's certainly an interesting topic to be examined, but I am concerned that those closest to the deceased may find it in poor taste. "

"No, you're just a wiener. "
"I am in no way one to speak of the precepts in a concrete way; I have literally broken one of the five precepts recently. But the way I understand the precepts through the suttas and abstractly, they are not stop signs inherently. If you can reap the dhamma in any way, it is of benefit. It just happens to benefit you better when you follow the five precepts. Truth is truth; of course, we shouldn't be destructive to find the \"truth\" but there are many doors that open to it, we just have to understand what makes us understand and what doesn't, and most (if not all of the time,) breaking the precepts doesn't help. If it doesn't distract from the way to understanding and your understanding of what to do, keep listening or singing the chant... it can aid you; if it doesn't, don't do it. Our experience will align with the Dhamma if we are living wholly.\n\nOn a personal level, I find the Dhamma in some of the music I listen to. The band Cynic is the band that introduced me to Buddhism to begin with; their sophomore effort, \"Traced in Air\" is full of Buddhist overtones. To be honest, if it weren't for Cynic's and Paul Masvidal's (their guitarist) echoing of the Dhamma, I might not be understanding it in the way I do now. "
"May the new year bring new insights and new causes for happiness for all living beings! Sadhu! "
"In Mahayana it's quite acceptable - from the Lotus Sutra for example:\n\n&gt;&gt; The Buddha said to the rākṣasīs: “Splendid! Splendid! ... How much more merit is there in protecting those who perfectly preserve and revere the sutra in various ways; such as by offering ﬂowers, perfumes, necklaces, fragrant ointments, scented powders, burning incense, banners, canopies, and **music**!. \"\n\n"

"It's not dubious when taken for what it is. The study concerns experience, and while we have machines that can map what is going on physically in the body and brain, we don't have any machines that can map the actual experiences of those stimuli. So we're stuck with self-reporting, which isn't perfect but is still considered a scientifically valid method of collecting data. And assuming the study was done in a sufficiently rigorous way, it can be assumed accurate within that scope, and indeed shows that there is some degree of consistency across our physical experiences of emotion."
"It has some qualities of a sangha, but it's not simply because a) it's not guided by monks, and b) this forum represents several traditions which contradict one another, which makes it a difficult environment to learn in for most people. \n\nThere are some online sanghas though, which are often complemented by phone (or skype) conversations with teachers and set times for practice. For Mahayana there is the [Plum Village Online Monastery](https://www.facebook.com/plumvillage), and additional resources at [Plumline](http://plumline.org/). The [Boundless Light Online Sangha](http://boundlesslight.webs.com/) is another that I have heard mentioned in the past, which leans towards Pure Land practice and offers a refuge taking ceremony via skype.\n"

"The precept is useful as to prevent your mind from being stimulated. Says you are watching a great movie or listening to a beatifull and emotionally provoking songs. Later in the day, you will still occasionally thinking about them. It will also provoke you into desiring things so it will interfere with the meditation practice but let's say if you put them into good use, it could become a tool to practice. Something like testing your practice. "
"For me, rebirth is being torn apart when I'm dead and the atoms that used to make me, will make new beings and new parts of old ones."
"I think agnostics are all about that.

Equally, they have no firm agenda about a complete absence of gods or afterlife experiences like some atheists."

"I do agree with you. It was never confirmed that my friend committed suicide, but knowing him and his history and the fact that he ostensibly posted a sort-of suicide note online made it apparent. I feel like knowing the cause of death can be helpful in several instances, and the outpouring of grief even among a small internet community indicates how much an individual can effect the lives of others. All of these things are valuable to the people left to contend with the aftermath of loss, no matter the proximity to the deceased.\n\nI suppose my objection is one that is informed by grief, so it could (and perhaps should) be taken with a grain of salt. My main point is that there's very little to be done, after the fact, so the best way to operate is with utmost respect to the privacy of the surviving loved ones. That requires a lot of presumption on the part of others, but I still feel it's due.\n"

Through practice (not illustrated here), we slowly unwind the ball, foot by foot, inch by inch, until that 'thing' we thought was a solid, substantial self, is gone. It's causes and constituents are still there, but now we see clearly what it is and it no longer has its mysterious power over us. we are free."

"This sounds like ancient Greek understandings of the brain to me. Back when Hippocrates believed that you couldn't perform surgery on the body because the body was sacred. They also believed the heart was a cooling agent for the brain and the seat of sensations are in the brain. \n\nThere's a reason why neuroscience currently leads the world in helping us understand how the brain works over psychology and ancient pseudo neuroscience. Better tools give us better and more accurate results. Why rely on a study like this when there are plenty more studies in existence that hint at stronger theories on how sensations and the brain works?"

"Buddhism is not a prescription - but practices such as the Burmese school of sati sampanjanna are...  One must combine moral conduct, insight, and concentration, at all levels, to undo the web of suffering - but even arahants still have karmic residue to endure.\n\ntl;dr - it's complicated"
"Buddhism, outside of the Bodhisattva ideal, is pretty selfish in the sense that it is far more concerned with your enlightenment than the enlightenment of others. There's plenty of really solid essays on how Buddhism appears selfish in a western model for this exact reason.\n\nAnd the blog post is seriously dumb because of the statement I posted alone. My post may have been sarcastic, but that view literally does equate a supervillain out to destroy the world with a Bodhisattva, since in theory they'd end *everyone's* suffering permanently.\n\nI mean there's also the fact that both eternalism and annihilationism have literally been viewed and referred to as heresies before and every single school of Buddhism rejects them.\n\nTrying to make Dharma be something it isn't because you're uncomfortable with actually believing anything beyond dressed-up altruism is grossly misguided, and that's clearly what the author was saying is fine here. The interpretation of the Dharma was left to one group and one group only, and that's the Sanghas. \n\nSangha, despite the beliefs of many, isn't Sanskrit for \"bloggers\"."
"You don't have to take rebirth literally.  Just focus on chaos theory, and that everything in the universe is interconnected.  Keep in mind there are more variations for a chess game than atoms in the universe.\n\nWhat we do causes other things to happen.  The complexity of the universe, as a system, is just completely immeasurable.  If you take karma to be this relationship we are to the universe, you don't need to believe someone is literally reborn.\n\nYou are not independent.  Your actions ripple deep into society, and society impacts you just the same.  \n\nThere is a lot of new age stuff on 'intention' and I try at all costs to avoid that.  But there is intention in that, whatever goal we have in mind, our actions will try to reach this goal.\n\nThis whole process is often unconscious, for example someone wants to be rich, so throughout their life things that have to do with money will peak their interest.   Eventually their world-view is framed around money, and sure enough they make some.  In that way intentions &gt; interests &gt; motivations &gt; actions &gt; results.  But new-age people like to skip the steps in between intentions and results.\n\nYou can see in this way intentions guide our actions.  So it is not nearly our actions that ripple in a chaotic manner through the universe, because the cause of these actions can be intention.  \n\nYou can redefine rebirth a little bit taking in some of these concepts.  If people are all so interconnected, then the world-view of one person will alter another's.  If one person has achieved a high level in Buddhism, then when he dies, hopefully his sphere of influence will have enabled another person to reach this level even higher.  This might be vaguely what they were thinking of in ancient times."
"How is that not annihilationism though?"
"&gt;  instead of me just listening to all her problems. \n\nListening and being there for someone does not alleviate an individual from needing to take personal responsibility for their emotions, actions, reactions, etc.  \n\nYOU can't and should not be the person that helps her move forward.  She and professional help can do that, but you have to be kind and compassionate to your own needs as well, which involve having clear emotional, and sometimes even physical boundaries. \n\nHope you find peace in your situation."
"I read a book once, \"Boundaries: When to say yes, when to say no.\"  Most of the book is probably lost to me, but there were two ideas that stuck with me years later.\n\n1. If what we are doing in an attempt to *help* is not *actually* helping.  Then we're NOT helping. We may have the best of intentions, or we may be selfishly motivated, but the fact of the matter is that if what we do doesn't make any difference, then it doesn't matter how good our intentions - they are worthless.\n\n2. If what we do for a loved one no longer feels loving, stop.  We are partners, we are not parents, so when we begin to feel pained, hurt, manipulated and resentful because we are trying to do good for another person, help them, etc... we are not contributing to their lives **we are robbing them** of the thing that we truly and uniquely have to offer them - love and compassion. "
"Just be sure not to get too tangled up in disbelief. "
"Because this study isn't about mechanism, it's about subjective experience, to which our only means of access is self-reporting, which is broadly relied upon for qualitative research by the modern scientific community.

As a result I don't have any other proofs other than I was there listening to him.\n\nThe abhidharma is a later addition to the dharma, and it isn't from the Buddha's mouth himself, so I see no problemin taking some things interpretively, and others more literally. This distinction between literal understandings and interpretive ones is accepted in Tibetan Buddhism, and thus because Mount Meru doesn't exists as espoused, it must either be taken interpretively or it exists in some other way."

"When we take care of ourselves, we are not abandoning the ones we love. Though distance is often the immediate result, in learning to set the boundaries which matter for ourselves, others learn that they can trust us. In taking space for ourselves, we give them space to be themselves, to grow and to change. Boundaries are not severance packages: they are self-knowledge and self-containment. imho, when we take care of ourselves we are able to take care of others and not before.\n\nI'm sorry this feels like a difficult time for you both. Nobody can set a boundary for you but you. I can't tell you the right thing to do, but I can say that a relationship in which communication is absent or avoided has little hope of clear boundaries. Best wishes."
"That's not what codependence means.  From the Wikipedia article\n\n&gt; Codependency is defined as a psychological condition or a relationship in which a person is controlled or manipulated by another who is affected with a pathological condition (typically narcissism or drug addiction); and in broader terms, it refers to the dependence on the needs of, or control of, another.\n\nGenerally speaking, it is an emotionally damaging condition."
"Fair enough. Im sorry to hear about your friend. I've never had to deal with a situation quite like that."
"Consider though that the Buddha said in his final words that he left it to the Sangha to decide if they would continue to observe the minor precepts.  This suggests that while some precepts, such as the precept against harming life, are directly harmful to oneself, the majority of the precepts were adopted because they were hinderances or could lead to harm.  I believe here that the Buddha suggests that some of these should be looked at again by the Sangha to decide just how harmful they actually are."

"Chipping in with a relevant quote (think I got it from you):\n\nBhikkhu Bodhi's translation of the Samyutta Nikaya, *The Connected Discourses of the Buddha* includes a partial excerpt from the [Saratthappakasini](http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bullitt/fieldguide.html#atthakatha) as follows:\n\n&gt;Spk: The living of the holy life (brahmacariyavasa) is the living of the noble path. One who holds the view \"the soul and the body are the same\" (tam jivam tam sariram) holds that the soul and the body are annihilated together (at death). For one who holds this, the annihilationist view follows, for he holds that \"a being is annihilated.\" Now this noble path arises to stop and eradicate the round of existence. **But on the annihilationist view the round ceases even without the development of the path, and thus the development of the path becomes purposeless**.\n"
"You know, the monk Ajahn Brahm has a really good story about this, from his book *\"Who Ordered This Truckload of Dung?\"* Page 112, entitled \"Being a Dustbin\":\n\n&gt;Part of my job is listening to people's problems. Often, when I hear the complex, sticky mess that some people get themselves into, my sympathy for them makes me depressed as well. To help a person out of a pit, I must sometimes enter the pit myself to reach for their hand--but I always remember to bring the ladder. After the session I am bright as always. My counseling work leaves no echoes, because of the way I was trained.\n\n&gt;Ajahn Chah said that monks must be dustbins. Monks, and senior monks especially, have to sit in their monastery, listen to people's problems, and accept all their rubbish. Marital problems, difficulties with teenage children, rows with relations, financial problems--we hear the lot. I don't know why. What does a celibate monk know about marital problems? We left the world to get away from all that rubbish. But out of compassion we sit and listen, share our peace, and receive all the rubbish.\n\n&gt;There was an extra, essential piece of advice that Ajahn Chah would give. He told us to be like a dustbin *with a hole in the bottom!* We were to receive all the rubbish, but keep none.\n\n&gt;Therefore an effective friend, or counselor, is like a dustbin with no bottom, and is never too full to listen to another problem.\n\nI hope this helps! Here's the [book](http://www.wisdompubs.org/book/who-ordered-truckload-dung) if you want to support him :) Good luck!"
"How canon is that story? Seems to go against the doctrine of rebirth (or is rebirth not canon in Zen?)."
"In your perspective, what reason is there to engage on the Noble Path, given that life is so short, and nothing continues after that could achieve nirvana?"
"What is your practice? Do you meditate regularly?"
"Big sadhu to everyone."
"This view is resoundingly rebuked in primary and secondary Buddhist texts."
"Probably not, but it's hard to use very few words to describe Buddhism. Perhaps \"The goal is to end suffering and escape the cycle of death and rebirth.\""
"This.\n\nMusic had to be a social thing back then. You had to go out. People would party and get drunk. This is obviously not a good environment for a monk. And lay practitioners would understand more easily why it could lead to poor practice. \n\nPretty sure no one expected us to be able to conjure music into the air using paper cones. "
"It could easily be read as he doesn't know what his next birth will be, and given the historical context of Zen that's how I'd read it."
"The same reason as always, to help end suffering for all things.  The length of life makes absolutely no difference.\n\nWhat do you mean nothing continues after achieving nirvana? "
"&gt; The same reason as always, to help end suffering for all things.\n\nIf there is no sort of continuity of individuality, then one cannot make this claim. As it has been pointed elsewhere, you seem to be arguing for the annihilation doctrine:\n\nBhikkhu Bodhi's translation of the Samyutta Nikaya, *The Connected Discourses of the Buddha* includes a partial excerpt from the [Saratthappakasini](http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bullitt/fieldguide.html#atthakatha) as follows:\n\n&gt;Spk: The living of the holy life (brahmacariyavasa) is the living of the noble path. One who holds the view \"the soul and the body are the same\" (tam jivam tam sariram) holds that the soul and the body are annihilated together (at death). For one who holds this, the annihilationist view follows, for he holds that \"a being is annihilated.\" Now this noble path arises to stop and eradicate the round of existence. **But on the annihilationist view the round ceases even without the development of the path, and thus the development of the path becomes purposeless**.\n"

"My teacher says he took over 10 years to get to full lotus.

"Here are the Buddhas criteria for right speech: \n\n[1] \"Do I speak at the right time, or not?\n\n[2] \"Do I speak of facts, or not?\n\n[3] \"Do I speak gently or harshly?\n\n[4] \"Do I speak profitable words or not?\n\n[5] \"Do I speak with a kindly heart, or inwardly malicious?\n\n[Source and more on Right Speech](http://www.accesstoinsight.org/ptf/dhamma/sacca/sacca4/samma-vaca/)\n"
"This is exactly what I was looking for. Thank you so much. I will be mindful of my limitations in the present while preparing my flexibility as well. No knee surgery for this disciple."
"yes I've read those... but what is the right time?  Can right speech be something that leaves the listener as unhappy or more unhappy than they were?"
"Same as the other guy said. Just take your time with it. I sit full lotus but that's only after a good ten years or so of sitting. There are some stretches you can do that may help but don't hurt yourself. "
"Sure! "
"From Thich Nhat Hanh's book, \"No Death, No Fear\":\n\n&gt;&gt; At this very moment we are being born and we are dying. We are being reborn not in one single form but in many forms. I would like you to imagine a firecracker. When you light a firework it does not go down in a vertical direction. It goes out in many dimensions, and the sparks go out in all directions. So do not think that you go in only one direction. You are like fireworks. You go out into your children, your friends, your society and the whole world.\n\n&gt;&gt; In the morning when I do sitting meditation, to my left and to my right are monks. I have been reborn in them by sitting with them. If you look carefully you will see me in them. I am not waiting to be reborn after I die. I am being reborn in this moment, and I want to be reborn in a good direction. I want to hand on to my lay and monastic friends the most beautiful and happy things in my life so that they can have a good rebirth for me and for themselves.\n"
"&gt; If there is no sort of continuity of individuality, then one cannot make this claim.\n\nWhat do you mean by individuality?  'What' is reborn should be unasked, because you are trying to give a name to something which has no use having a name.\n\nAsk instead, why is something reborn?  And individuality plays no part, causality does.\n\nHolding the view that the body and soul are the same, requests definition of soul.  If you define soul as our relation to the universe, than no it does not die in the same way the body does.  While any sense of 'individuality' will perish, the effects you have on the universe will continue to ripple in your legacy."
"AFAIK it's a common relationship (mars v. venus) thing. Women talk about their feelings to connect/share, while men only communicate with purpose; your husband thinks your sharing your feelings means there's a problem.\n\nI think bringing this difference to his attention would do more good than curbing this particular behavior. But then again this is a relationship advice, not a Buddhism advice, so you can ignore this :D"
"Zen does not deny rebirth, and Soto Zen's founder, Dogen, explains the correct view of rebirth in his essay, Bendowa.  So....\n\n&gt;This heretical view (~Brahminism) says: In our body there is a spiritual knowledge. Through the knowledge we recognize like and dislike, right and wrong, pain and titillation, and suffering and pleasure. This spiritual knowledge, when the body deteriorates, is released here and is born anew elsewhere. Therefore, though it seems to die here, it is born there. It never dies; it continues eternally. This is the heretical view. If you absorb this and think it is Buddhism, it is more foolish than holding roof tiles and pebbles and thinking they are the golden treasures. This foolish delusion is shameful. It is beyond serious consideration. \n\nAnd....\n\n&gt;In Buddhism you have to know this: the body and mind are one; essence and form are one. Make no mistake- this is known also in India and China. In a teaching that talks about eternity, all things become eternal. Don't separate body and mind. In a teaching that talks about cessation, all things are ceasing. Don't separate essence and form. Why do you say that the body ceases while the mind is eternal? Isn't this against the right law? You must realize that life-death itself is nirvana. We cannot talk about nirvana without life-death. You think erroneously that this is the Buddha wisdom free from life and death. Your mind, which understands and perceives, arises and perishes; it is not eternal. Understands this thoroughly: the unity of body and mind is always upheld in Buddhism.\n\nFrom:\nhttp://www.zenki.com/index.php?lang=en&amp;page=bendo01\n"
"Can you give me an example of the last time you complained about something?"
"&gt; I feel as though since I'm not helping him any, I should focus on my own journey. That by finding peace of my own completely, perhaps I can be a light to him.\n\nI think this is certainly the right approach. True love isn't to tether your entire self to your loved one, it is to be the strength when your loved one is weak. And vice versa. Your relationship should be like a mini Sangha - you support one another to finding relief from suffering and finding lasting joy in life together. If a Sangha fell apart when one monk had a bad day, what use would the Sangha be?"
"I agree that the question of 'what' is reborn is not a useful one. The trouble is, in one of your earlier comments, you tried to provide an answer to that question by claiming that it is the \"sphere of influence\" cultivated in a single lifetime of a person that enables his rebirth in the impact it has on the lives of others. I don't think this view can be justified on the basis of the Buddha's teachings, and as it tries to define 'what' is reborn, it is a futile effort. The Buddha taught of rebirth as a continuity of process - the conditions that give rise to becoming from moment to moment in a single lifetime don't cease with the physical death of the body; they continue to serve as the \"requisite condition\" for birth: \n\n&gt;\"Not a valid question,\" the Blessed One said. \"I don't say 'clings.' If I were to say 'clings,' then 'Who clings?' would be a valid question. But I don't say that. When I don't say that, the valid question is 'From what as a requisite condition comes clinging?' And the valid answer is, 'From craving as a requisite condition comes clinging. From clinging as a requisite condition comes becoming. From becoming as a requisite condition comes birth. From birth as a requisite condition, then aging &amp; death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair come into play. Such is the origination of this entire mass of stress &amp; suffering.\n\n&gt;\"Now from the remainderless fading &amp; cessation of the six sense media comes the cessation of contact. From the cessation of contact comes the cessation of feeling. From the cessation of feeling comes the cessation of craving. From the cessation of craving comes the cessation of clinging/sustenance. From the cessation of clinging/sustenance comes the cessation of becoming. From the cessation of becoming comes the cessation of birth. From the cessation of birth, then aging &amp; death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair all cease. Such is the cessation of this entire mass of stress &amp; suffering.\""
"Closer to Upāsaka and Upāsikā then sangha, and probably not even that because anyone on reddit can post"
"You may find that sometimes we fool ourselves using passive aggressive behavior. We may state one thing and believe it yet our actions, tone of voice and so on may indicate exactly the opposite. In general it is much easier to fool ourselves than it is to fool other people. What you would have to do is see if you are actually being honest about how you think you are feeling? Does feeling negatively make you a bad person? If you believe it does then you are more likely to suppress the feelings, and lots of suppressed feelings lead to being an inauthentic person. "
"All your questions are variations on \"why do people take refuge\" and I've already answered that.\n\nPeople take the Refuges because they've decided to become a Buddhist.  It's really no more complicated than that.  You're saying you've taken the Buddha as your teacher, the Dharma as your guide and are formally joining the Sangha."

You've only provided formal recitations. We all know the recitations, and thanks for reminding us of them. \n\nWhat is refuge, and why do people seek it?\n\nthanks -"

What are they?\n\nI think the answer to that question is self-evident.\n\n&gt; you haven't answered what refuge is.\n\nNo, you haven't comprehended what I've already written, or have just chosen to ignore it as \"recitations\".\n\n&gt; What is refuge?\n\nLook in a dictionary."
"I'm not the person you were responding to before. \n\nI agree with you that you can be agnostic about or even reject rebirth but the obligations of Buddhist ethics towards helping relieve the suffering of others would still stand (but then again, if one rejects the traditional teachings on rebirth and holds that suffering ends merely with death, then killing with the intent of ending the suffering of others could become justifiable). "
"To some extent this requires personal judgement. Without knowing all the details of the situation it's really hard to give an absolute answer.\n\nI take right time to take into account the following (not an exhaustive list): Do you have a close enough relationship that the conversation is helpful? What were the previous words spoken? Is this person going through some difficult situation right now that would make this conversation better suited to another time? How is the person communicating emotionally right now?\n\nThe most important thing is you know the criteria of the Buddha so you can continually evaluate if you are meeting them. Another important question to ask is: what is your intention for saying what you are saying? Again something to continually reflect on-- the continual reflection is more important than if any one conversation was right or wrong."
"I don't belittle anything. Glib recitations without meaning, however, do indeed belittle the life of faith.\n\nThose answers are not self-evident, particularly to those confined to glib recitation.\n\nYou haven't written more than a glib recitation.\n\nI have seen the dictionary. Not sure if you have. It might help you get beyond glib recitation.\n\nI'm guessing we're done here, if all you have to offer are glib recitations we've all read. Best wishes for a Happy New Year to you. "
"I don't think they are the same at all. If Christianity comes from the bible then it is not based on peace, same goes for Islam and Judaism. Look at their writings not what people have cherry picked.  Not all roads lead to the same place. Buddhism asks and answers much different questions than monotheistic violent religions."
"Atheist here.  I have no firm agenda of nothingness after death.  However, given the lack of evidence to the contrary this seems most likely.  I think most atheists are open to the idea that there might be something after death (rebirth, heaven, etc. ). But these fantastic claims are easily dismissed with no evidence to support them."
"The problem that Buddhism concerns itself with isn't whether consciousness continues after the death of the brain, but rather than question of \"whose consciousness is it anyway?\". Every moment we identify with this thing we call a self, which includes our consciousness. Yet with reasoning you cannot pinpoint this self, its edges are blurry and its substance nowhere to be found. So what we identify with cannot actually be the true us. We have to broaden our view, look around us, look to others, to get closer to our true identity. This is the very basis of compassion, and of rebirth. If our self cannot be pinpointed, then how can our death be pinpointed? How can our birth be pinpointed? \n\nThe problem is with true identity, and letting go of false identity. Once we do that, rebirth becomes clear to us.\n"
"That's fine if that's what you believe, but it's a bit of a dick move to come into a Buddhist sub and say that part of the refuge vows are easily dismissed. The question was is it important to Buddhists, not atheists."

"Zen doesn't need an \"online home\"."
"It's not even about being willing too be wrong. Even if your opinion is  that rebirth is true or false most people who hold one of those views hold it only as an opinion. Few are dogmatic enough to insist there is absolute truth in their words. At best we are arguing over which metaphor is slightly more \"true\" than another. But we are dealing with concepts that  go beyond intellectual understanding to such an extent that even the best possible metaphor may be so \"wrong\" as to not be worth having.\n\nIn short people need to grow a pair and at least have an opinion. The option to not have an opinion on having an opinion it ridiculously dull from not just an intellectual level but an emotional one too."

The suffering of living things is completely tangled, to the point that it is best sometimes to just say 'suffering' without an individual to possess it.  \n\nPeople are all a result of this tangled web of interactions which includes suffering, and because of this, no one person more special than another.\n\nIf we are completely dependent on each other, and I am no more special than you, this is reason enough to never harm you."
"I would not go so far as saying that it is rebirth...Yes, we are all changing and everything around us effects that change, but we are not being reborn, in either literal or spiritual sense.

We live now on through ideas and how we effect others.\n\nIt effected me because I can effect the thinking and ideology of thousands of people via the internet...\"I\" can still effect them long after I am dead. You can see this through Karl Marx, Isaac Newton and Gautama Buddha...All their ideas still live on, even though they have been dead for a long time...\n\n\nBut if you truly live in the moment, then I can understand why Thich Nhat Hanh sees it this way...This moment \"you are you\" and the next \"you are someone else\". You may look exactly the same, but on the smallest time scale you have changed just a tiny bit...And every 7 years or so, almost all your atoms and cells have been replaced by others."

"I am the result of millions upon millions of stars and other life forms dying and their atoms eventually coming together for a very short time to create me. Only once will this particular combination of atoms be tried and after that, they are redistributed again. This happens to all beings, all planets and all stars.

"&gt; I feel as though since I'm not helping him any, I should focus on my own journey. That by finding peace of my own completely, perhaps I can be a light to him.\n\nYou cannot change anyone.  You can only change yourself.  Yeah, people say very weird things and we as Buddhists often have to accept that the person speaking is deluded.  But we also see their suffering, and want to find the best method to deal with it.  \n\nI recommend you practice 'right speech', and speak from your heart simply and honestly.  Don't be attached to results. When he realizes that his anger and depression are not affecting you, he will have discover that they don't work...  It's very possible to stay together, but a relationship should let you realize your own dreams without excessive restrictions.  In other words - yes, go your own way (for now).\n\nMy father was a diabetic and always ate the wrong foods.  My mother freaked out each time.  I told my mom to just let him have his way.  As soon as she stopped complaining and following him around, he quit eating the wrong foods - because he became responsible for his own actions."
"It is probably a learned behavior, or perhaps a bad habit, that you just want to become more mindful about.  Maybe something to sit with in your meditation practice?  I would suggest that many things are owing to some combination of sadness, anger, and fear, and you may want to get in touch with those threads. "
"Which is a wonderful and beautiful thought, and not at all what was meant by \"rebirth\" as a core definition at any point in the history of Buddhism."
"You should explain to your husband what you mean when you say such and such so he realizes not to take it too seriously.\n\nAs for curbing the behavior itself, all behaviors have reasons.  Based on what you write it appears stress management is your reason.  So it means you need a substitute way to manage stress.  In managing stress I suggest that there are two approaches that should be taken.  Short-term and long-term.  Short-term is something you can do immediately to lower stress.  That something can be meditation.  If you're too amped up for sitting meditation (you can sit on a chair, btw), you can go for a walk and do walking meditation.  But that's only short-term.  Long-term one effective approach is to engage in analytical contemplation of stress, its causes, its conditioning factors, and contemplation of stress cessation.  You learn to understand stress on a new level by contemplating it and looking into it deeper than usual, thus gaining a more profound insight.  Then also contemplate what Buddha has suggested as the causes and conditions leading to the cessation of stress and see if those apply in your life.  It's OK if they don't apply.  Don't be too dogmatic in trying to always conform to Buddha's conclusions, but just work with the Dharma topics and Buddha's insights into stress.  And you don't have to agree with something to work with that same something and gain benefit."
"Because it is a relatively new discovery. And I am pretty sure Dalai Lama said something about that Buddhism was ready to change if science proved anything about it to be wrong..."
"And science hasn't proved rebirth wrong, no physical evidence isn't positive proof.

"You're not very well informed on the topic of pure vision.  This topic is discussed at length in all kinds of Buddhist sources, but I'll just give you a [Pali Canon search](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22purified+and+surpassing+the+human%22+site%3Aaccesstoinsight.org) as a starter."
"I would suggest, instead of vocalizing your stress, to simply meditate on it and remind yourself of the non-reality of it all. "
"Zen is just too fluid to be constrained by words. It's just easier to have it be physical than digital."
"Not trying to be a dick, sorry. It's just that in the context of the discussion your comment seems a bit like a Christian chiming in and saying \"of course there's no rebirth, we are judged by God and go to Heaven/Hell\", it's a different worldview than Buddhism, so of course the interpretation is different. "
"From what I understand, even though the lives of sentient beings are interdependent and interconnected, they are still separate processes (in a sense, this separation is needed for there to be inter- relationships), separate (but again, interdependent and interconnected) continuities of causes and conditions. The process of 'you' will experience the fruition of karma arising from 'your' intentions and actions, and not another. But others will still be impacted, in different ways, by your actions because of interconnectedness. \n\nIf the death and break-up of the body alone ends this process, and the suffering inherent to it, then you're not harming or contributing to, but relieving that suffering by enabling death. And you would only suffer the karma arising from that action until your own death, upon which it's extinguished. This is one of the reasons I believe the traditional understanding of rebirth is crucial to holding together Buddhist ethics with its doctrines on the nature of existence. The traditional notion of rebirth, as I understand it (and obviously, please correct me if I'm wrong), is simply that the causes and conditions that precipitate becoming from moment to moment in this life don't cease with the death and break-up of the body; they continue to act as the requisite condition for birth (referencing the sutta I quoted earlier). \n\n\n\n"
"You could try keeping a pen with you and marking a tally on your hand every time you catch yourself complaining. It's not about how many tallies you mark each day, it's just about training yourself to eradicate this harmful behavior and thereby undercut the afflicted mental states from which this behavior springs. Harmlessness is 1 of the 3 Right Intentions of the Noble Eightfold Path, and the endeavor to remove evil, unwholesome states of mind is 1 of the 4 Right Efforts. Also complaining wouldn't qualify as Right Speech unless what you say is true, beneficial, and fitting given the circumstances."
"&gt;Few are dogmatic enough to insist there is absolute truth in their words\n\nLike Buddha when he taught about rebirth?"
"Not even a semi-intellectual post but then it's a blog, and all blogs are just rants seeking attention. I regret reading them every time.\n\nIf you've ever trained in a Zen temple, you don't have \"intellectual discussions\" with your fellow monks or your teacher. Your teacher gives you a koan, you think about it **on your own** for a certain period of time, and you give your answer to your teacher. If you are wrong, rinse and repeat. There is no sharing of thoughts and ideas, there is nothing to be gained by anything outside of your own mind. The entire purpose of Zen is to point all questions directly to your self, to your \"true nature\", and the teacher exists because he is someone who has seen his true nature and thus has the ability to guide you in your practice.\n\nThe reason why Zen can't find an online home is because the inherent nature of the above mentioned practice contradicts an online presence. There is simply not a single reason in having a Zen forum or subreddit where fools try to analyze and discuss or worse, imitate Chinese masters without having a clue what they're doing (or even worse, are under the delusion of having a clue what they're doing), koans and are instead often misused as a form of trolling.\n\nIf you really want to practice Zen, making a vow to not speak a word for a month under any circumstances will gain you more ground in your practice than reading koan books for a decade."
"&gt; Few are dogmatic enough to insist there is absolute truth in their words.\n\nWell, the Buddha was crystal clear on this subject.\n\n&gt; \"Here, the Tathagata understands as it actually is the possible as possible and the impossible as impossible. And that is a Tathagata's power that the Tathagata has, by virtue of which he claims the herd-leader's place, roars his lion's roar in the assemblies, and sets rolling the Wheel of Brahma.\n\n&gt; \"Again, the Tathagata understands as it actually is the results of actions undertaken, past, future and present, with possibilities and with causes. That too is a Tathagata's power...\n\n&gt; \"Again, the Tathagata understands as it actually is the ways leading to all destinations. That too is a Tathagata's power...\n\n&gt; ...\n\n&gt; \"Again, the Tathagata recollects his manifold past lives, that is, one birth, two births, three births, four births, five births, ten births, twenty births, thirty births, forty births, fifty births, a hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births, many aeons of world-contraction, many aeons of world-expansion, many aeons of world-contraction and expansion: 'There I was so named, of such a clan, with such an appearance, such was my nutriment, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my life-term; and passing away from there, I reappeared elsewhere; and there too I was so named, of such a clan, with such an appearance, such was my nutriment, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my life-term; and passing away from there, I reappeared here.' Thus with their aspects and particulars he recollects his manifold past lives.

"I understand that Michael was not a Buddhist. He said this October 20, 2011:\n\n&gt;I’m not a Buddhist, much less a Gelugpa, although I am (broadly speaking) sympathetic to the Prasaṅgika interpretation of Madhyamaka that the Gelug tradition espouses.\n\nSource: http://speculativenonbuddhism.com/2011/10/13/fanged-dialogue/"
"The term \"level\" does not seem quite on target, as I doubt the process is that linear.  That said, I could imagine an AI that would serve the place of a \"zen master\" and guide students on the path.  I expect that degree of sophistication for an AI is dozens, or even hundreds, of years away.  "
"Probably not a good idea to ask this question of an online community like this, because the only person who can give you a fully appropriate answer is somebody who can actually do what you're talking about: and that person would be an arahant or bodhisattva who has the proper karmic disposition to be able to teach many kinds of people. I mean, I could refer you to stuff in the Pali Canon, but that's material that was expounded by a Buddha and then codified by arahants. In terms of the really subtle Dhamma that is involved in the paths and fruitions, the teacher should not only be arahant/bodhisattva, but also endowed with telepathic abilities.\n\nEdit: That said, I'd be happy to refer you to material written by a now-deceased arahant monk from the modern period, where he discusses the higher levels of practice associated with nonreturning and arahantship, if you're interested."

"Those are important questions, and they deserve extended and careful treatment. Thanissaro Bhikku, a pre-eminent Theravada monk, has written a significant essay/short book on the subject of taking and committing oneself to the refuge vows, its history and salience as a religious practice. You can read it here, if you'd like: http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/refuge.html\n\nEdit: I think only reading the introduction section might be sufficient to get good answers to those questions.

"On p. 25, will finish it for sure, excellent read &amp; thanks a lot."
"Actually yeah, this is precisely why I can't consider myself a Buddhist. I find a great deal of value in many Buddhist teachings, but I don't believe in reincarnation. So to me, it really does seem like you can just kill yourself and reach nirvana in an instant--and that killing others liberates them too. I am not suicidal nor homicidal haha, but I see how that would work in principle at least. :)"
"What I meant is if Buddhism is ready to reject something, it could also be ready to adopt something."
"Thanks for posting.\n\nFirstly, I would like to cite a poem which is relevant to you, by Mahmood Jahmal;\n\n\n&gt;Autumn leaves are falling all around,\n\n&gt;And more of them there are than can be numbered,\n\n&gt;A thousand times lovers die,\n\n&gt;The fire leaves their lips,\n\n&gt;And so many loves go with the treacherous flow of time,\n\n&gt;So many partings there are we can never count,\n\n&gt;Even as we meet,\n\n&gt;We have already parted,\n\n&gt;Even as I die Ananda,\n\n&gt;I hear the sprouting buds of early spring,\n\n&gt;Like the raining leaves beyond our numbering,\n\n&gt;Are the Truths that lie under the sky,\n\n&gt;I bring only a few by which I feel we can understand our suffering,\n\n&gt;So mournful you are, Ananda that you see not\n\n&gt;That death is only a part of all that lives\n\n&gt;And what I speak may soon be all forgotten,\n\n&gt;So go and preach what you believe,\n\n&gt;And gather all your mind can grasp,\n\n&gt;From the Truths raining down like leaves from the silent heavens,\n\n&gt;And remember that which all my teachings lead towards:\n\n&gt;Be You Lamps Unto Yourselves\n\n\n\nThis passage beautifully illustrates the cycle of life, its inevitability, vulnerabilities and the core lesson that you have already touched upon.\n\n\nAt the risk of sounding cliched and corny, the best time to let go in a romantic relationship, or any relationship, is at the start, where you already you accept that holding on to your dear, will bring you the greatest pain/joy. We don't want to ride the wave, love. We want to lessen its pulls, because we know that it is fleeting and temporary. All said and done, this is easier said. But the discipline you learn from the mirror that is your relationship will guide you until the end, even when your husband has withered away. You must let go! But you must also love without any strings.\n\n\nYou have already seen the problem\n\n&gt;&gt;I realized lately that I feel a bit codependent in that my happiness has become more and more reliant on his own happiness. \n\nYou already see the solution\n\n&gt;&gt;That by finding peace of my own completely, perhaps I can be a light to him. \n\n\nYou already know that we are beings of emotion, washing and seceding like a shore; the intelligent, (consequently depressed), mind knows this but the wise one acts on this truth. The way is to find a strength within you that will radiate throughout. You can love, cry, feel all the same; but you must first accept that this man was, is, and can never be yours and that ultimately his path is his own accord.\n\nI do hope you find and overcome this obstacle. It's amazing how much we learn about ourselves through others. I hope that you strive to find that strength, the unspoken confidence, the condition-free love, that you can share with others. \n\nPeace!"
"I doubt Buddhism is ready to accept the idea that Buddha was full of shit."
"Please explain why reducing the suffering of others and learning to live a joyous and contented life is \"purposeless\"?"

"I basically agree. I witnessed a very short dharma talk from the head of the Cheontae (Korean revival of Tiantai) school in which he simply instructed the listeners to chant a mantra (kwansaeeumbosal), and gave no other advice. Afterward, a nun explained that they use the mantra as a form of meditation for single-pointedness of mind, i.e., essentially, samatha.\n\nWhich isn't to say that in other traditions mantras don't have very different rationales - they do."
"Good points. You're absolutely right"
"Excellent.\n\nMantras are good for those who think a lot.  The mind likes to think and so, we're intentionally giving it 1 thing only to think about, over and over again.  What this does is to help us let go of conceptual scattered thoughts so that we can see beyond it.\n\nThe proof is in the pudding.  There's this ehi passiko - come and see for yourself - so people will only understand it once they try it and develop some skill with it.  As Ajahn Mun said - all you need is 15-20 minutes a day initially.\n\nThis method is so deceptively simple - hence I wanted to share it.  Yet illiterate, uneducated people can find success with it.  That shows you the power of it to help you to see beyond intellectual thought."
"Don't make \"level\"."
"Ok. I'm done trying to explain this to you. You do not want to see things from another persons point of view. So goodbye and may we never meet again."
"Well I did say few; not none. Plus the whole process of rebirth and what is rebirthed is pretty unclear. Unclear because it has to be. The actual process whatever that may be is obviously beyond our comprehension. Perhaps any comprehension that is possible within the confines of the reality we currently find ourselves in. Therefore the best we can do is describe it in very inadequate terms, pure experience is the only way isn't it?"
"It's not that your point of view is different, it's that you're in /r/Buddhism trying to explain that Buddha was wrong and ignorant and how we should just adapt to the times. "
"Well, if you're Buddhist and accept Buddha was enlightened then you can pretty safely rely on his word, but it's a valid point that none of us have gnosis of rebirth. The process and what is rebirth ex has been the subject of much discussion throughout Buddhist history, but there hasn't ever been a conclusion of \"nothing\". Usually it's mindstream vs. basal consciousness. "

"What's wrong with the materialist mindset?\n\nWhatever magical experience you happen to have is far more likely to be a hallucination or some mental artifact of meditation than a refutation of the materialist model of the universe. "
"Perhaps you can try to stay mindful of when you are complaining, and every time you complain, say something that you are grateful about as well.\n\nThe best would be to do them on the same subject, like a \"silver linings\" exercise, such as \"this soup is too cold... but the flavor is delicious!\" \n\nIf you can't manage that, just day something unrelated of you are grateful for when you catch yourself complaining. \"This shirt is itchy. By the way, thanks for the back rub you gave me yesterday!\""
"You must have so much knowledge on the path, why not share your knowledge with him.  Help him out, let him know that getting angry and ragey is only hampering him, you, and the relationship.  Stay constructive and understanding.  And finally, you are great, remember that :)"

"My apologies for the wall of text. I suppose this spoke to me, having experienced trauma in my past and having developed a \"rescuing\" interpersonal style that emerges (big time) in a romantic relationship.\n\n\nI'm trying to read between the lines because it almost seems like you're holding back, trying not to be too critical of your husband (out of respect), or as if there's something selfish about your needs. I understand that your heart is heavy with uncertainty but—and I say this with compassion (I hope)—why do you feel guilty? You're trying to address a fracture in your relationship with your husband, which I'm assuming he feels as well. That's courageous. You're not doing anything wrong, you're doing right for yourself and you're trying to do what's right for him and the relationship.\n\n\nAnd yet... if that doesn't quite resolve the guilty feeling, I get that too. You're trying to reconcile your very different processes in dealing with trauma (was it a shared trauma?), and there's turbulence in trying to bridge that gap. When your path seems to be leading away from your partner's path, when your stories seem to be diverging, you're going to question yourself (which could lead to shame) and you're going to question your partner (which could lead to guilt).\n\n\n&gt;I feel as though since I'm not helping him any, I should focus on my own journey.  That by finding peace of my own completely, perhaps I can be a light to him.\n\n\nI would respectfully disagree (slightly disagree) with my fellow redditor who gave the example of Ajahn Chah's teacher-student advice. In my opinion, a marriage isn't akin to a teacher-student relationship, especially when the teacher is a celibate monk. I quoted you above for the same reason. Your intentions are obviously good but you can't be his teacher, or his light. As admirable as that may sound, I don't believe it really honors either of you. It puts you in a horribly burdensome position and (not to make you feel guilty!) is somewhat patronizing to him and his process. The Buddha said, \"Be a light unto yourself\" not \"be a really bright light so other people will see it and realize how good it is.\" More than likely you will end up resentful of your savior role, and he will resent needing to be saved.\n\n\nSo, all of this is just the lead up to this heartfelt advice, I think you should seek couple's therapy. I know it might seem like a drastic step, but the fact of the matter is this sounds like a crisis (at least, a crisis in the making). You *can't* \"overcome\" this, nor should you, *not on your own*. This can't be your project, it has to be both of you working together, preferably with the help of a good counselor. He has to know that, even if it doesn't include meditation and buddhism, you still respect his path. Having said that, he also has to know you can't go on like this. You feel isolated and scared and overwhelmed, and you feel the way he's processing (or not processing) his past is damaging the relationship you've both built together and both cherish so much. You need him to be your partner and, especially where trauma, depression, and rage are concerned, I think you both need/deserve a wise therapist to help you reunite as a functional partnership.\n\n\nFinal thought: If you're like me, you might feel shame at the prospect of seeking help, as if it's a failure of some kind. It's funny that I'm still tempted to think, \"My parents never needed couple's therapy!\" Oh right, but my parents got divorced after decades of rage and unhappiness which eventually morphed into abuse. Riiiight, *that's* what happens when there's past trauma that gets buried and can't be looked at.\n\n\nAt least that's my humble opinion. I hope it's helpful. I wish you, and him, and (that third conditioned being) your relationship all the best."

"What if it was observed by the Tathagata?"
"&gt; I would say agnosticism is fine depending on the sincerity and openness about being wrong\n\nI would add, agnosticism is perfectly fine as long as you don't say that the Buddha himself was an agnostic on rebirth."
"&gt; I think agnostics are all about that. They just refuse to get tangled up in any firm beliefs about spirituality and fully embrace that they have no idea what life really is or what may be it's natural progression beyond death. \n\nThis hasn't been my experience in interacting on the Internet.  Most of the time I find people doubting rebirth is when they hold materialistic beliefs about the nature of reality (everything subsists on matter).  They think the brain produces the mind and so with the dissolution of the brain, the individual mindstream is cut off.  Thus no rebirth, and no different realms either and when Buddha remembered his past lives he was either lying or sincere but deluded.  It doesn't seem to bother any of these folks that the Buddha was aware of this view and has rejected this view (called Ucchedavada in Buddhism).\n\nThis is very far from \"refuse to get tangled up in any firm beliefs\" because in my experience materialism is an *exceptionally* firm belief for many people.  It's beyond doubt for many.  It's not subject to serious questioning for many and if you dare try, people will think you're kooky for trying such an \"insane\" thing."

You can fill water into bottles, and many kinds of zen and related topics have found a large number of online homes.\n\nHere is a tl;dr for this blog post: \"I want people on the internet to talk about aspects of zen that I like, in ways that I like, within the Bhuddist context I like, and offer me stuff that I like (wisdom and insight) in the process. If they don't do that, they are suffering from certain maladies...\"\n\nI don't think this one wins me over."
