"&gt; There's no way I can eat an entire pound of beef for dinner and that doesn't seem very healthy to me. \n\nSure you can.  At least you can try...  See how far you can get.\n\n&gt; My problem isn't staying full until my next meal, it's making sure my blood sugar doesn't drop and I don't feel faint. \n\nThat's why you eat a large, slowly digesting, low GI meal like a pound of beef.  It creates a very stable serum glucose level.\n\n&gt; I'd be much more comfortable eating small meals throughout the day\n\nDo you want to be comfortable eating or not pass out from hypoglycemia?  Your call...\n\n&gt; gargantuan meals\n\nGranted I'm a competitive eater that can eat 5+ lbs in a single sitting I don't consider a pound of food to be \"gargantuan\"."
"Seems like you fell for the idea of Satori, bought into the marketing trap!\n\nYeah, I've heard Vegans call Avocados high in protein...and pork bacon is low in fat..."
"google"
"Just because you've never seen \"evidence\" that suggests that an individual can obtain a certain body weight and body fat percentage doesn't mean that it can't happen.\n\nWhere's your evidence to suggest excessive protein intake provides faster muscle growth?"
"Um, you're placing the burden of proof on me...  Why don't you produce a study that says otherwise.  In fact how about this...  Show me just one person who says they gained muscle mass eating 1g of protein per kg of body weight and is over 180 lbs at single digit body fat.  I can produce a lot of people with that body composition who will tell you otherwise...  So just show me one person...\n\nMy original point stands and you proved it.  It's the bean poles who say you don't have to eat a lot of protein to gain mass, but you know what...  I tend not to take advice on how to save money from people who are broke..."
"Makes sense, no need to apologize. The lifts I posted were my reps for 5x5 (because I haven't tested my maxes in a long time), but I know they're still low.\n\nWhat do you mean though about my body not being able to use that much protein? I have no background in nutrition or anything, I've just never heard anyone say that before so I'm curious about it.\n\nThanks for your help!"
"Thanks for the advice and for sending me the article! I actually bought some greek yogurt earlier today, and I'll get some kashi and almond milk next time I go shopping."
"Former meat cutter here:  We used to use the rule of thumb that if beef were wrapped in butcher paper and put in the freezer immediately, then you can expect it to last a year. Poultry under the same conditions can be expected to last up to 2 years. \n\nYou have to know that the freezer doesn't completely keep the meat from spoiling. Think about it like there is an amount of bacteria on the meat and when it reaches a critical mass, then the meat is spoiled. Well, a freezer does not completely stop the bacteria, it just slows it waaaaaay down. \n\nAnother thing you need to consider is that just because you can expect something that long, it doesn't mean you should. If your freezer thaws out refreezes, would you know? It is a good idea to put a small ziplock bag of icecubes in your freezer, and if they thaw out, they will refreeze as a chunk of ice instead of cubes. If you ever open your freezer and see a chunk instead of cubes, then you know that the stuff in your freezer is most likely spoiled."
"Basically the stronger you get, the more muscle fibers you are able to recruit during your lifts. More fibers equals more tearing, which means more repairing has to be done, and as such more protein. At such an early stage, your nervous system and muscles haven't reached a high enough level of efficiency to actually put that amount of protein to work. That's all. Does that make sense?"
"The burden of proof is on you to back up your claim. All I'm saying is that you only need ~1.0 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight to get muscle gains. Since you are claiming that more protein is required, you must provide proof to explain why more protein is required. You haven't done that and you won't be able to because protein requirements are simply not any higher than that for humans.\n\nedit: here's a study that shows that increasing daily protein intake from 1.35 grams per kg of body weight to 2.62 grams per kg of body weight has no impact on muscle growth in weight training.\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1400008"
"&gt; The burden of proof is on you to back up your claim. \n\nNo it's not it's on you too.  Your claim has no proof either.  You're saying something without any scientific proof.  At least I have clinical evidence.\n\n&gt; Since you are claiming that more protein is required, you must provide proof to explain why more protein is required\n\nLet me reword this...  Since you are claiming that you don't need as much protein, you must provide proof to explain why increased protein consumption isn't necessary.\n\n&gt; You haven't done that and you won't be able to because protein requirements are simply not any higher than that for humans.\n\nYou're a bean pole.  The people who recommend small protein intake are bean poles.  The people who are very muscular eat more protein.  If it looks like a duck, and it quacks like a duck, it's probably a duck."
"Looks like 6 months to a year, depending on the type, according to the CDC's [Storage Times for the Refrigerator and Freezer](http://www.foodsafety.gov/keep/charts/storagetimes.html). They are an excellent resource for consumer food safety information.\n\nP.S. Responsibly raised meat is not just better for you and the planet, it also tastes better! You'll be glad you made the switch, even if it means eating a little less meat overall due to the cost. Don't forget to check into local farmers markets for the really good stuff."
"The ice cube in a bag thing is absolutely genius advice. Seriously. I've never heard of that before. As a Texan with a meat freezer on the side of my house, thank you!\n\nediting to add: you wrote \"former meat cutter\" and then your username is.. well.. lol"
"You don't have \"clinical evidence.\" Personal anecdote =/= clinical evidence. I'm glad you're able to go to the gym and lift weights and increase your body size in a healthy manner. That does not in any way prove that protein requirements are higher than I've stated.\n\nIncreased protein consumption is not necessary for muscle growth. Excess protein in the diet beyond what is used for maintaining homeostasis is all converted to carbohydrate-like small molecular weight carbon sources that will either be broken down further for energy immediately, or used for fatty acid synthesis ultimately producing triacylglycerides that are stored as body fat. The body has a built-in mechanism for handling excessive protein intake.\n\nAnyway, you can stop with the personal attacks, you don't know anything about me and it's entirely uncalled for."
"You still can't even provide the name of a single person who is over 180 lbs and single digit body fat that recommends that low of protein consumption.\n\n&gt; You don't have \"clinical evidence.\" Personal anecdote =/= clinical evidence.\n\nNo it's clinical...  You can ask the myriad of professional experts and trainers such as Dr John Berardi, Charles Poliquin, Christian Thibaudeau, Jim Wendler, who will all tell you when gaining muscle mass that you need more than 1g of protein per kilogram of body weight for the best gains.  By the way all these guys fit the over 180 lbs and single digit body fat requirement...\n\n&gt; That does not in any way prove that protein requirements are higher than I've stated.\n\nYou haven't proven they're as low as what you're saying either.  You're the pot calling the kettle black here...\n\n&gt; Anyway, you can stop with the personal attacks, you don't know anything about me and it's entirely uncalled for.\n\nWhat the bean pole comments?  You said you were thin and not muscular = bean pole.  It's evidence that your recommendations are too low.  Like I said I don't take investment advice from people who are broke..."
"This personally doesn't affect me, but my it happens to my dad. When he drinks coffee for a few days, his hands start to get really dry and crack up. It's honestly very odd, but all he does to counteract it is he sleeps with shea butter on his hands. Hope this somehow helps."
"What do you put in your coffee? I drink mine black, no ill effects here. Some people have breakouts when they eat a lot of sugar or dairy. Maybe it isn't the coffee but the stuff added to it. "
"Maybe you are right. I always have drinked a lot of skim milk. I have heard that it is bad for your skin mainly because it contains a cocktail of hormones, but it has some key benefits for bodybuilding which is why I drink it. For 90 calories, you get 9 grams of proteins. It is also quick to drink, cheap, and contains calcium/vitamin D (someting most other food sources don't contain).\n\nBut I always have been drinking skim milk.  \n\nI also always drink my coffee black with nothing. I'm suspecting that it's causing me this (the breakouts) because it somehow changes the acidity level in my guts. Well this is what I have read."
"Your break outs could be caused by dehydrated skin. Caffeine in itself isn't dehydrating, but coffee is a diuretic which can compromise your fluid balance. For skincare questions I HIGHLY recommend [r/skincareaddiction](http://www.reddit.com/r/skincareaddiction)! Look at their FAQ which has more info about dehydrated skin and how to treat it. This may not be the cause of your break outs but hopefully this subreddit will help you get to the bottom of it.\n\n[Sourcy](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19774754) [mcsource](http://www.livestrong.com/article/497932-the-effects-of-coffee-on-hydration-levels/) [source](http://www.coffeeandhealth.org/media-centre/fluid-balance/)\n"
"hi, I am taking the online didactic program in nutrition through U of Alabama. It is just great- doing courses online requires a ton of self-motivation and organizational skills, BUT it is super flexible for those of us that need to work, take care of children, etc during studies. I would definitely recommend it. The course cost for online courses is the same as in-state fees at U of A... meaning, you only pay what Alabama residents pay. This may seem like the standard, but it's not. Other online nutrition programs typically charge out-of-state fees even if courses are online, so unless you are a state resident you can expect to pay up to double per course. For me, $1500 per course was unaffordable. Also, you can write your exams via ProctorU, which is supported by U of Alabama's Blackboard learning website. This basically means paying about $15 for some person at the ProctorU centre to proctor your exams via webcam without ever having to leave your home. It's great. After your coursework is completed, you would apply for a practicum in your home state, then write your exams to become a registered dietician. Hope that helps, good luck:)"
"Try 2%.  Skim milk is supposed to be worse for acne than other types of milk."
"/r/keto. Ketosis provides many of the metabolic \"advantages\" of starvation (reduced hunger, ketones as brain fuel, improved fatty acid mobilization from fat cells, etc) while preventing the loss of muscle that *will* occur on a starvation diet. Vegetable are helpful, but not required. You can get all your nutritional needs met if you are selective in your meat consumption, but, even if she isn't selective, she is still going to be *much* better off with a straight meat diet than starving."
"Thanks a lot, still trying to do my research"
"The requirement to be an RD is what will keep me out of the field. I am in complete agreement with [Dieticians for Professionak Integrity](http://integritydietitians.org/) that the AND has become ~~corrupted~~misguided by the [companies that sponsor it](http://www.eatright.org/corporatesponsors/), resulting in dietary advice that isn't making people more healthy and may, in fact, make them much less healthy."
"I'm not an expert, but as far as I understand juicing gives you an opportunity to consume a lot of nutrients via a glass of beverage. \nConsuming raw fruits and vegetables is a sure beneficial for you, but if you have no appetite for 5 carrots, a beet, a few stalks of celery, a couple of apples and a ginger at the same time, then juice is a way to go. \n(My son is 18 months old and he can't handle some greens and vegetables yet, but he loves so much all the juices I make for him. It's the only way for him to consume this food and the fact that he liked it makes me very happy).\n\nI think that a healthy balance between juiced, blended and whole produce is the best way to go. \nI juice daily, I eat a huge bowl of salad for lunch and fruits in between, I do like a glass of smoothie too and I feel bad, whenever I don't have an access to one of above (that's why I got a small travel blender)."
