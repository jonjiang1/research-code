"&gt; My stash is a memento of all my travels: an alpaca farm in Asheville NC, the time I got to visit a spinning mill, the trip my boyfriend took to Italy.\n\nSee if he'd done up a description like that he could have sold that yarn for a *fortune* on Etsy"
"I saw that. Unfortunately I didn't have the money to plunk it down and he was hesitant to sell it in pieces. It's some good stuff by the looks of it."
"Thanks! I found that box with the straw in our cellar, my parents must have received it as a gift box a couple of years ago. ;)"
"$500!?!?!? What the what?!!?"
"oh god what is this? New group to follow &gt;.&gt;"
"That was my thought, too! Or maybe they hide drugs in it during shipping..."
"I totally need one of these. It looks great. "
"I'm gonna have to seek them out. I'm staying a crochet and chardonnay group with some of the girls at work, this sounds right up their alley. "
"Thank you so much for this! I need to knit my friend something and this is perfect! "
"Maybe she forgot to switch the currency from USD to Zimbabwe dollars?  Million dollar loaf of bread anyone?"
"Ahah it reads like yarn erotica!"
"Haha, it seems intimidating at first, but it gets easier, I promise!\n\nOn another note, non-knitters I've met tend to be pretty amazed by the number of needles when you knit with DPNs. I made my boyfriend a hat for Christmas this year, and he wouldn't stop telling people about the number of needles (five!) I used to make his hat at our last holiday party (while he was proudly wearing it, of course)."
"I have a demon cat that looks just like that. I love her dearly. Even if she is evil and plotting my demise."
"It's lovely you should totally share those charts on ravelry"
"nice!  beats having them in random mason jars, or tardis coffee mugs around the house.  did you make it?"
"I googled double knitting in seed stitch and all I found was double seed stitch which is the same as the moss stitch. \n\nI have asked a Ravelry friend of mine who is a master knitter and co-chair of the judging committee for TKGA on the master program if it is possible.\n\nIt seems to me by the nature of the stitch pattern that it is not possible to be truly double knit."
"Thanks! Now I can finally be done with my fuzzy scarf!"
"People tell me all the time that it looks like I'm knitting with a porcupine when I'm on DPNs... Especially with a sock!"
"I'm a right-handed person that knits in either continental and Eastern style depending on my mood; that means I tension my yarn using my left hand. I used to be an English-style knitter (where tension is controlled using the right hand), but I made the switch when I figured out that knitting continental style was so much faster. The issue I had when I first made the switch was keeping even tension, but kept on practicing until I was satisfied with my gauge.\n\nAs for Eastern knitting, when you purl, you mount twisted stitches. That means, when you come back to the same stitches in the next row, you have to knit (or purl) through the back loop to untwist the stitch (this happens in both knitting flat and in the round). This can cause issues with charts, increasing/decreasing, among other things if you don't account for the twisting."
"I'm left handed but like most things in life adapted to a right handed world.  I knit continental style but instead of having the right hand needle do most of the work, I have my left index finger (with the yarn wrapped around it) move towards the right needle.  I think if you are starting out it is easier in the long run to learn to knit \"righty\".  \n\nI used to hang out at my LYS and sit with a wide range of knitters.  It seemed to me that everyone's knitting technique was unique.  Some were close and some completely different.  Find what works for you."
"Interesting! I didn't know that there were right-handed styles that could run into the same problem as lefties who knit left to right. Thanks for sharing!"
"Yeah, I may be s.o.l. That was my problem when googling. I may just do a two-tone seed stitch. Thank you for asking your friend!"
"On the off chance that maybe you're not implementing the join right, here's a [Very Pink video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMncPOeK29Y)."
"sorry, meant to post saying my bf got this for me for christmas. I believe he purchased it from someone on etsy. he picked out the colour, design and button. Did a wonderful job"
"I'm also a lefty who is semi ambidextrous - there's a specific term, but I forget it. I bat right, kick left, write with left, etc...\n\nThough I knit right, it does take me a little longer to figure things out and I have to watch videos over and over before I grasp it because sometimes I get confused on which hand should be doing what. \n\nIf you know someone who knits, it may be helpful to you to watch them knit mirror-image -- you face the person instead of sitting by their side. When my mom was trying to teach me how, someone recommended that. Didn't work for me, though - just made me dizzy, heh."
"Put that in perspective and it becomes obvious why he feels taken advantage of. If I left and couldn't take everything with me, I'd leave the old 70s acrylic I've accumulated, the Red Heart Super Saver...I could probably find a good 17 pounds to drop. This girl left GOOD stuff behind!\n\nI'm growing a conspiracy theory in my head...the guy who posted the ad isn't Tom, he's [Ryan Gosling](http://www.pinterest.com/pin/254383078924344529/)."
"*incomprehensible screeching and grabby hands*"
"This is fantastic! How long did it take you to complete it?"
"I have to agree, the tone he used left me disturbed. I won't say he's abusive just by one ad, but part of me wonders if there was something darker going on."
"I just saw that you figured it out so yay! I just figured I would still show you this video about [joining in the round](http://youtu.be/vMncPOeK29Y) for your next project. It isn't necessary, but it does make a nicer edge. I think this is probably why the pattern said to place the marker after you joined."
"I was just about to do the same thing for the same reason! \n\nThe closet in my boyfriends home office has a 3ft tall box loaded with yarn. Plus I have another crate or two lying around the house. "
"This has GOT to be some kind of tax scheme, or something. What the heck!"
"[deleted]"
"I am also working on my first real sock on dpns and I see a lot of people complain about them but I am in love. I like them way more than circulars for projects in the round."
"&gt; The trick is to USE IT.\n\nSo THAT is what I've been doing wrong . . ."
"To be honest, I think that's the main reason I continue to go back to DPNs... circulars are nice and all, but they don't have that \"holy crap what the hell are you doing?!\" impact. I like everyone around me to be suitably awed, you see. \n"
"Not all of it is dubbed, but it's still a good watch!"
"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=393N4z5mmPU"
"Thank you so much for this - as of right now the actual link isn't working. I just cried laughing at this from your screengrabs. My 2013 wouldn't have been complete without reading this.\n\nHappy New Year!"
"I'm not really good at giving people who talk about their exes in this way the benefit of the doubt. if they're concentrating on events and actions, that's different from denigrating them to be the lowest sort of scum. and I see a lot of \"lowest sort of scum\" sentiment here. "
"As a Manhattan career woman, I can say with certainty that even at 75% off, I don't have to have it. :-)"
"I LOVE DPNS!  After awhile, you really get the hang of things.  I actually like them better than circulars because no matter what I do I either have to magic loop or have tons of extra cable.  But I remember the first pair of socks....it gets easier, I promise!"
"Lefty continental knitter reporting in! I find that I control enough with my left hand that I can just use the 'normal' technique. "
"I am a right-handed knitter that knits a bit \"left-handed.\"  I knit continental, but I \"throw\" the yarn over the needle with my left index finger, if that makes any sense.  My left hand moves a lot more than my right hand, which just puts the right needle in and pulls the loop off.  When I first started knitting in earnest, the muscles on the back of my left hand were achy for a bit while they adjusted to being used in new ways."
"These are great!!"
"I absolutely love working with DPNs!  The first item I made in the round (fingerless glove) was on DPNs and I learned so much just by making that one glove."
"Very cute!"
"Don't worry, questions are good!\nYour rows would like this:\nRow 1 rib colour A\nRow 2 rib colour A\nRow 3 knit colour B\nRow 4 rib colour B\nRow 5 knit colour C (or A)\nRow 6 rib colour C (or A)\nEtc, etc, assuming you want to rib for the entire scarf. When doing stocking stitch, colour changes are much easier.\nTo stop your work rolling over itself, you block it. Once finished knitting, you get the piece really wet, and then pin it on a piece of cardboard or press it in a towel until its dry. That's a pretty short description, google blocking for something more in depth.\n\nA cowl in stocking would be about the same difficulty, imo."
"Hey that's a great idea!"
"How have I never heard of this place? Thanks!"
"Good news!  I was wrong--my knowledgeable friend said you can do almost any stitch in double knitting--that it \"may not be easy, but it can be done.\"  \n\nSo good luck!  I still think I would do a swatch in stockinette stitch so you can get the hang of it--be easier to tackle something tough.  \n\nCongrats to you for bringing up such an interesting problem--I learned something totally new! \n"
"It definitely does feel like that"
"You clearly have more sense, though."
"http://www.craftsy.com/blog/2013/04/how-to-knit-seed-stitch/ I found this blog post incredibly useful when I first started seed stitch (had the same problem you did, I kept ending up with ribbing instead.... and now I can't manage to get my ribbing to look that pretty again, dang it!). \n\nIt has a description of what a knit stitch and purl stitch look like from the front (since you're knitting in the round, the only side you'll be looking at) so if you get lost or distracted, you can figure out what the next stitch should be!\n\nAnother thing I do when learning new stitches is try a small (10 stitches or so) swatch first, rather than trying to do the huge rows of 100+ stitches where it can be a long time before you can tell if you're doing it right or not. "
"Yay! Keep at it :)"
"Purl 3 together through the back loop sounds unnecessarily painful and awful. I can barely purl two together through the front loop O.o"
"They're only a couple years old. The owner and everyone there are all just wonderful people.  "
"I always feel like one is pointing threateningly at my eye, but I love knitting with them despite this!"
"Return yarn? What is this madness of which you speak?"
"hahahahahaha, yes, and no matter how times you've used them, the first few rounds always feel like this"
"I'm left handed, but I'm pretty sure I knit like a right hander. I hold the needle with the stitches on it in my left hand, and I hold the yarn and other needle in my right hand, so my right hand ends up doing all the work.\n\n"
"[deleted]"
"I think they must have added a few too many zeroes in there. "
"I just made my first pair of baby socks, and this is totally what I felt like!  "
"I'm pretty sure it can be done. It's really confusing to explain though. Basically, when you are working a stitch on the front of the fabric, the other color should be kept in the back regardless of if you are making a purl or knit. And when you are working a stitch on the back of your fabric, the main color should be kept in front of your needles, regardless of if it's a knit or purl. \n\nSo normally in stockinette you knit the main color (front) and purl the contrast color (back), you bring both strands to the back to make a knit stitch on the front, and both strands to the front to purl the back. When you purl the front you keep the contrast color in the back behind your needles, and only bring your main color to the front to purl, making sure not to cross your strands or it'll bind the two fabrics together. "
"Finishing the project is a thousand times easier on DPNs. I think I prefer them too."
"I don't know, I just finished a pair of mittens that had four circular needles in each mitten at one point."
"I appreciate the fact that you admit that you only made the one glove."
"Yeah well I spoke too soon.\n\nSomehow I ended up with 134 stitches after doing about 4 inches and had to take it all out again.\n\n8th time is a charm?\n\nThanks for all the tips and links...I will be checking them out in the morning.\n\nHappy New Year everyone!"
"I have my fingers crossed for a response, omg please."
"It seriously looks so intimidating, and even feels so intimidating, at first. But it's one of those things that you have to just... DO. And then you'll get it."
"Haha yeah.  I didn't see the point in making the second when the first was basically a train wreck."
"It only took me about a day of knitting. I didn't do much else... but a day is all it took."
"About a day of solid knitting. I did a few other things, but knitting was the most of my day."
"That's even better, haha. Now I just need to get green yarn. I promised myself no more, but the green I have just isn't dark enough D: "
"The color I used is kelly green. The brand  is Vanna's Choice by Lions Brand. I usually chose a better kind of yarn, but the color was perfect."
"I felt the same about my first mitten ever, but then my husband bugged the shit out of me about it. I finished it tonight, so I wouldn't bring that horrible knitting karma with me into 2014."
"Add me to this list! I can't seem to get the hand of magic loop, DPNs are more fun anyways. "
"That's so cute! Can you post a picture of the inside please? I'm considering getting a little case-thing similar to that."
"Where can I find a good tutorial for this? I have the dpns and the yarn but I'm scared!"
"OH OH OH!  I know of a place you can donate to!\n\nThere's a group called [Are You Warm Enough?](http://www.ravelry.com/groups/are-you-warm-enough) on Rav, started by a teacher. Lots of her students are from low income families and often don't have sweaters that match the uniform code. She's always looking for sweaters, cardigans and the like to help them meet code. \n\nShe also uses hand knit socks as rewards for good grades/behaviours."
"Some people are just that bad. I'm glad you haven't had a chance to meet them.\n\nIt sounds like Tom got screwed over in the whole thing, but assuming he's abusive because a woman left her yarn and cats behind is a pretty shitty way to judge people. He obviously has issues with the whole thing, probably stemming from the fact that *she took out credit cards in his name without him knowing.*\n\nIf anything, this post screams of him being taken advantage of.\n\n&gt;I'm not really good at giving people who talk about their exes in this way the benefit of the doubt.\n\nThis is one person. One.\n\nOf course we're only hearing one side of the story, but implying he's an abuser because he's angry about circumstances? That's just not right.\n\nOf course, this whole thing kinda bothers me. I know most people are joking, but everyone's jumping onto the whole \"he's an axe murderer\" thing over a couple trashbags of yarn. jesus. Some people need to stop watching crime dramas."
"My uncle was in a relationship with a woman that ended up moving in with him after about 6 months (he is not a wise man). They ended it, and she stayed in the house. It's probably just a small community thing, but he ended up asking the cops how the hell he was going to get her out of his house, and they told him to just let her stay for a while (until a friend could take her in, or something. Basically, \"let her stay, we can't actually kick her out of the house\").\n\nIt was crazy. So many variables in a relationship, especially when living together. Sadly it's not a clean break-up-and-go that most people like to assume. Tons of stuff behind the scenes that people will probably never know."
"Ridiculously overpriced. I hope no one falls for it and actually buys it. "
"Wow...that's just...wow. "
"Yes but $350 dollars for a solid hat and scarf set? o_0 \nI've got my Harry Potter scaves going for $45 and slouch hats for $30."
"It's ridiculous!!!"
"Me too. "
"That sounds great! I'll check it out, thank you!"
"... wait, HOW? "
"I am working on completing my first steeked project, a [fair isle sweater](http://imgur.com/d3hm4Uu) based on [this](http://www.ravelry.com/projects/elf518/the-clock-sweater) one's charts, but I've had to make up the sizing, placement of the armholes, neck shaping, etc. Project page [here](http://www.ravelry.com/projects/frightmolt/cuckoo-clock-pillow). I'm now finished with the body. All I have left to do is crochet around the armhole and neck steeks to reinforce them and then **CUT MY KNITTING**! WAAAAH! I'm a relatively advanced knitter but steeking has always been my greatest fear, so my New Year's resolution is to successfully cut the steeks and complete this damn sweater's neckband and sleeves quickly enough to take the finished product back to school with me next week.\n\nOther things I want to do for 2014:\n\n* Actually complete IntSweMoDo. I failed this year, but it's a goal! Think I need to pick easier sweaters.\n* Knit more gifts. I'm totally and completely a selfish knitter, for which I'm mostly unapologetic, but I should try to knit a few things for others.\n* Knit another sweater with MadTosh, aka the best yarn ever\n* Knit a colorwork sweater that is 100% my original design\n* Make my college graduation hat. We have a tradition right before graduation where everyone goes to a ceremony wearing hats. Need to find just the right pattern (needs to be something strange/interesting/not warm at all, since it'll be May)\n* Get my hands on the [out-of-print polar bear sweater pattern I've been coveting](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/7901-polar-bear) and make it\n* Actually do a pattern so simple it's mindless. This sweater has stressed me out a little. So much math!\n\nAs for patterns, there are sooo many, but at the top currently:\n\n* Banksy-inspired [balloon girl mittens](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/balloon-girl)\n* [Stonecutter sweater](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/stonecutter)\n* [Cherrystone sweater](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/cherrystone), because I want something simple for once! Something I won't overthink.\n* [Van Doesberg sweater](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/van-doesburg-pullover)\n* [Kenzo](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/kenzo). This is a cardigan, but I strongly prefer pullovers so may attempt to convert these cables into a pullover\n\n"
"This is so cool, at first I thought it was a set of weird looking uterus patterns but I can totally see the helmet now!"
"DPNs terrified me at first, but now I'm a pro. I absolutely love them! I think the hardest part isn't learning the technique, but figuring out a good way to hold your work so you can still keep tension and not have to worry about your stitches falling off the needles. Once you've practiced a bit and gotten that down, they're a breeze. "
"You're so right! I only saw two blankets, but it's not even as if her stuff has complicated stitch patterns. You'd need an industrial size machine with ribbing capability but we've had factories that do that for at least the past 100 years."
"Sorry it took so long to respond. I did knit a few rows before I end up connecting the round."
"I'm very left handed. I was taught english right handed and it just failed. I was just horribly slow. I disliked shoving my needle in my armpit. I can't believe I made half a blanket knitting like that. Left handed english didn't go well either.\n\nRetaught myself right handed contintental (from the first Stitch and Bitch book, I think it says it's a good style for lefties) and it just clicked. Soo much easier! My knitting and yarn is in the left hand. When I started, I didn't do picking with the right needle and more wrapping the yarn with my left finger. Over time, it's a little of both picking with the needle on the right and wrapping the yarn with the left. Over a decade later and I knit pretty fast, with a good even tension. I highly recommend learning continental to avoid the headache.\n\nI crochet lefty, which is a headache following patterns on occasion, so I'm happy I am able to knit right handed."
"Sorry for taking so long to respond. After knitting a few rows I was able to get a tube. I've also learned that mirrors are very useful.\n\n"
"I really wanted to create my own knitting pattern. I've been trying for a month but looks like I gotta frog the thing again. I do my own crochet patterns and making knitting patterns seems harder for me - I got plenty of ideas but not sure how to make them.\n\nI was doing a MKAL in October (boo knits Morticia lace shawl) and maybe 40% done. I still haven't seen the results (expertly avoiding the ravelry page, hence why I'm not linking it here), and I hope to finish the shawl. It's been hibernating as the beading is just tedious to do."
"[deleted]"
"I've just learned how to knit a few weeks ago. There are a lot of left handed videos but recently I couldn't find one that could help me do what I wanted to do. It took a bit but I learned that any video can be lefty friendly with the help of a mirror.\n\nI knit continental with the yarn in the right hand and make the stitches with the left needle. "
"I purl differently. I purl through the front (but not through the left, but the right ... I'm right handed) and wrap the yarn under my needle. Like I said before, everything I've made looks fine and I never had any trouble with it. I do enjoy how my knitting looks more uniform by doing it so, but I might give the \"right\" way a go while knitting patterns that need to be fluffy. "
"I want to make the [February Baby Sweater](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/baby-sweater-on-two-needles-february). I've seen so many people go on about it, and it looks like an interesting challenge.\n\nI've gone digging around and read people's blog posts and I think I've worked out what the pattern wants me to do, though I've already changed the increases because I just could not make them look tidy.\n\nGeneral plan for 2014 is to knit a bunch of baby/small child sweaters. But this is my specific one, and I just started this morning."
"Oh gosh, I was actually looking at that shawl today. It is definitely in my queue. The result is gorgeous, please post pictures when you get it done. "
"I knit for my local clothing bank. Last year I did hats and scarves - various sizes, colours, styles, just knit them as and when, kept them in a box, then took them down to the bank when it got colder.\n\nThere were more little kids there than I'd realised, so now I'm having a go at some baby sweaters/cardis. I've got a couple in various stages of finished, am hoping to have three or four to drop off by the end of January along with a few more hats. "
"And she won't even throw in a pillow with it."
"I have no idea. I'm left handed but mostly right hand dominant. I learned from my grandmother when I was a wee little kid, by sitting next to her so I think I knit right handed but my mother is convinced I knit left handed? Old stitches on left needle, new stitches on right, yarn in right hand. "
"I'm jealous! Those are some of the best circular needles on the market! "
"You have a lot of needles! lol"
"Wow, lucky you :) That first sublime wool looks like it would be really nice to work with.\n\nThe german \"Limbo\" is most likely \"Schurwolle\", which is virgin wool :)"
"I'm going to jump in the set-in sleeve bandwagon. The easiest way to do it is to find another pattern with the same ease and same tension &amp; copy those sleeves. If you're more comfortable with raglan it would work (there are lots of generators), but that style tends to look a little more casual and work better with a plain sweater."
"Grandmas Rock!!"

"Happy New Year!  \n\nI'm working on the[ Stockholm Scarf](http://www.ravelry.com/projects/HelenWhiteley/stockholm-scarf) at the moment with my new set of Knitpro Nova Metal that my SO gave me for Christmas.  Using Stylecraft Alpaca DK in cinnamon.  The creator of the pattern doesn't recommend this pattern for beginners but I think it's pretty ok, haven't messed up too much so far! "
" Crap.  I forget that sarcasm isn't easily read. I wouldn't even buy it for $5. "

"Thanks for the tip. I did a [deathflake](http://www.ravelry.com/projects/x0rawr0x/deathflake-chart) once, and think it turned out okay. It just takes an awful lot of effort! I've been more into crochet over the past two years, but do miss knitting. I might set myself up a small colourwork pattern to practice with to get back into it :)"
"What is up with me and fiddly?  First, there was [Stjarna](http://www.reddit.com/r/knitting/comments/1mmoht/weekly_wednesday_work_in_progress_thread_918/ccaov4b?context=3\").  Now it's Jay Petersen's [Entrelac Cube with Continuous Cables](http://www.ravelry.com/projects/pellia/entrelac-cube-with-continuous-cables) - ([Pic](http://images4-d.ravelrycache.com/uploads/pellia/203648212/uploadedImage_medium2.png).)  The charts do not match up on this at all.  Basically, he gives you an idea, and the puzzle of this puzzle ball is that you have to suss how to assemble it correctly.  \n\nDue to the above, I've picked up incorrectly, or guessed the wrong chart and had to frog the square.\n\nI'm about to run out of Fisherman's Wool, and at my current point, you might have up to 8 DPNs going about.  This is no different than using 4 to 5 DPNs:  just ignore the ones not in use as best you can.  I've seen FOs using circulars.  I would not recommend this!  The pattern comes with 2 PDFs.  You need to start with version 1.1 which tells you how to knit the squares in order, 1-24 and where they pick up and are connected.  This sometimes has you skip to the other side of the work.\n\nBelieve it or not, there is method to this madness.  Basically, you're making an entrelac hat, first counterclockwise, then clockwise, then counterclockwise.  It only *seems* like it jumps around because of how the pattern is written.\n\nEDIT:  [Rav pattern link](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/entrelac-cube-with-continuous-cables)."
"Looks really good!"
"It took me 56 stiches to get a lil over 20 inches...would bigger needles help? I'm still a rookie. "
"It was a lucky day for you, for sure.\n"
"Awesome. \n\n\nI'm also laughing thinking about the people doing the dubbing..."
"I linked to an album containing a picture of the inside, is it not working? \n[Here it is](http://imgur.com/Tk2SJmA)"
"Not pictured is my addi interchangable set, which I've bought all the additional tips for haha. Probably don't need any more for a long time lol"
"&gt;Some people are just that bad. I'm glad you haven't had a chance to meet them.\n\nI have met bad people. That's precisely why I took against this dude. He acts and talks and carries the attitude I have experienced from bad people, plural.\n\nAnd I didn't pull those remarks about women's shelters out of thin air, either. In my case it was before I started knitting again, so it was books and music. I treasured those books and that music, but the shelter was very specific about just how much space I had for stuff, and it certainly didn't include space for 17 pounds of yarn. I'm sure he called me all kinds of names for leaving my books, my music, and any clothing that wasn't \"Office professional\" behind."
"Thanks!"
"i have done charity knitting, and you can donate in a lot of places.  If you want to continue to knit sweaters--a homeless shelter, or women's shelter is a good place.  There are often children or babies at both places.\n\nI started a chemo cap group  --knitting hats for women going through chemotherapy and also newborn hats, premie or normal size.  Premie hats are about the size to fit an orange.  I have seen pictures of a nursery where every newborn had a different hat.  But hospitals have different guidelines on the composition of the yarn based on how they wash them.  Some will not accept any wool, some will.  Most want acrylic--some will not accept acrylic/nylon blend. Just check with your local hospital.  Baby socks are also fun if you have some small amounts of yarn to knit up.\n\nAnother good place is a teen clinic,  the group I started began knitting layettes for them.\n\nAnd then, I realize you do not like baby blankets--but I have a simple lace ripple pattern that goes quickly (feather and fan) and I have knit some of those and donated to a homeless shelter.\n\nFinally, I would suggest going online to see what charity groups there are available in your area.  Just google \"charity\" put in the place you live,  and see what comes up.\n\nHope that gives you some ideas :)"
"I have made gloves before with DPNs, and I am also currently working on socks for the first time. The only problem I have with DPNs is the row/stitches in between needles being looser than the rest. I'm sure it has something to do with my tension going in between needles."
"It's THAT easy! \n\nOr so I hear. "
"I have done lots of socks (over a hundred pairs), and do them with stitches on 3 needles and knit with the 4th.  Sometimes when I do the gusset, I put the heel stitches on a 4th needle so it is not split tightly and to avoid a ladder.  \n\nI think the most important steps you can take to avoid ladders is 1) positioning the needles correctly as you change from one to the next.  and 2) knitting the first stitch tightly.  You can help this stitch lock in it's tightness by also working the next stitch tightly.  \n\nI am not especially crazy about this video, she knits in the tail with the first few stitch-I think this would make for some bulk in your cast on edge--I weave the end in later down a ribbed edge inside and it looks great.  But it does show the position of the needles when changing from one to the next.\n\n http://www.knittinghelp.com/video/play/double-pointed-needles"
"Sometimes things can get really crazy, especially in lace knitting- more specifically, Estonian lace knitting.  Sometimes you'll purl or knit through so many stitches that is easier to use a small crochet hook to pull through all of the loops.\n\nCheck out the stitches for the Good Day Sunshine shawlette on ravelry!"
"I think I'm going to cut steeks for the first time today, which is momentous for me. The sweater I'm working on is a version of [elf518's clock sweater](http://www.ravelry.com/projects/elf518/the-clock-sweater) with long sleeves and traditional neck shaping instead of short sleeves and a funnel neck. Project page is [here](http://www.ravelry.com/projects/frightmolt/cuckoo-clock-pillow), and [here's](http://i.imgur.com/d3hm4Uu.jpg). Knit in Wool of the Andes Sport, which is decent. After cutting the steeks only the neckband, shoulder seaming, and sleeves will remain!\n\nThis break I finished [two](http://www.ravelry.com/projects/frightmolt/embrace-octopus-sweater-pattern) [sweaters](http://www.ravelry.com/projects/frightmolt/shadow) and a [hat](http://www.ravelry.com/projects/frightmolt/scrollwork) before this project. Next thing may be [Cherrystone](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/cherrystone) in Cranberry Wool of the Andes, because I want something simple and not stressful to knit and it seems a good option."
"After the frantic knitting dash that was the Such Christmas vest last week, I'm trying to re-learn how to knit slowly. Yes, I'm trying to *slow myself down* and actually enjoy the act of knitting again. I'm working, on and off, on an [Easy Lace Cowl](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/easy-lace-cowl-4) in [Malabrigo Yarn Rastita](http://www.ravelry.com/yarns/library/malabrigo-yarn-rastita) that my mother got me as payment for making her a winter hat earlier. I'm only a couple of repeats in, I'm knitting probably half a round at a time unless I'm watching Star Trek, and never pushing myself to do more than I want. It's ... refreshing."
"I like DPNS and I use them for finishing all time. They can be finicky at the start. \n\nIf your just trying out DPN's for the first time consider starting with another technique like magic loop and switching to DPN's after 10 rows or so. It'll give your work a lot more structure and make it easier to control the needles. "
"Using size 7 needless with yarn intended for size 13s, will result in super dense fabric, and much hand/wrist pain."
"There's not a hard and fast 'rule' that I can think of. However, most color knitting tutorials I've seen don't recommend floats/carrying the unused color more than 3-4 stitches (approx an inch/2.5 cm depending on gauge). If you're doing stranded style knitting, you can 'trap the unused colors under the active color by wrapping the active yarn around the extras before knitting it. (Pull this stitch a little tighter to account for the extra slack and to ensure colors don't show through. \n\nThe other big thing I can think of is to be careful of your gauge and tension so that in the places you do float your yarn it doesn't pucker the fabric."
"I've actually tried that with her giant stuffed animals. She is content helping me get the dogs arms in the sleeves and walks around hugging and humming to it once the sweater is on. But the minute you take it off she freaks. "
"Yeah, that's how I purl when I'm working flat. Definitely, I'm not trying to discourage you from trying new things! I get a little bit defensive about it since people have gotten snarky about my knitting style before. \n\nI got a friend to teach me the more common way of purling, and geez, I see why people who use it don't like ribbing or moss stitch. It's so much harder! I do intend to master it at some point since I have a goal to try pretty much everything out there eventually, though. "
"If you use that yarn and those needles your sweater is going to turn out gigantic. You could try scaling it down, but if you're new to knitting you may not feel comfortable with that. My recommendation would be to choose a different yarn that can be worked with size 7. "
"Yarn is a mix of unknown and Red Heart Super Saver (there's so much of this in my stash....).  Used size 7 needles.  Pattern is a mish mosh of [Lovebird Beanie Hat](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/lovebird-beanie-hat) and [Keep it Simple Hat](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/keep-it-simple-hat) with a slightly modified colour pattern.\n\nI finished this at 1:15 am last night, making it decidedly my first FO of the year, and being my second real stranded project, I couldn't be happier.\n\nedit for grammar"
"You will have less stitches per inch on bulkier yarn and large needles.  That will create a much larger finished object.\n\n With that much if a gauge difference the only thing I can think of would be to change the stitch count in the pattern to match your gauge.   For example if the sweater is x many stitches wide, you would translate their gauge to inches and then figure out how many stitches you need in your gauge.\n\nIf you're not familiar with making a gauge swatch, take some time to learn.  I'm on mobile so I can't link, but knitty has a good explanation."
"I made this a couple months ago, and it's one of my favourite scarf patterns!  Yours looks great so far!"
"If you allow $150 for expenses, being generous, and figure she's expecting $18/hour for her time, that's still 1380 hours. Which, if that blanket took you that long, you'd want to get paid for... But you're probably needing to come to terms with the fact that you're just not fast enough to knit for sale. "
"I have some wip's i need to either finish or frog, and i suspect that i'm going to go on a long run of lace projects.\n\ni also have 2 more dresses i'd like to knit, but I'm not going to start on either of them until about march i think."
"Thanks!  I'm a complete novice so my 1x1 ribbing is terrible looking!  But sure the only way to learn is by doing it!"
"I just did a hat using magic loop (because I didn't have DPN large enough) and I found it to be too...choppy?  Having to constantly move the cable around made me crazy and it messed up my rhythm.  But I am definitely really happy that I learned it because every technique has it's place. "
"I'm working on [Toe-up Double Lace Rib Socks](http://i.imgur.com/4iSCD3o.jpg) - [original ravelry pattern here](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/double-lace-rib-toe-up-socks).  It's my first time using fingering weight yarn and it is both the coolest and most annoying thing to work with.  Also my first time with a provisional cast on, which I'm having a hard time getting right for converting to in the round knitting.  The sock itself, however, seems to be turning out beautifully.\n(I'm using Lion Brand Sock Ease in colorway Taffy on size 1 needles)"
"What brand of yarn is that? I really like it."
"I used to have that problem all the time.  The easiest way to fix it it just to pull the first couple stitches on each needle really tight."
"Thanks! I figured this would be the case, but I didn't know if there was a simple \"fix.\" I will have to look into this whole gauge thing. :D I started knitting as a task to help with patience... but I have been to impatient to start with the basics. Which, is obviously a set back. \n\nagain, thanks for the advice. I'll check out knitty tutorials."
"Thanks. I have plenty of yarn that will work with this pattern. I just happen to love this particular yarn. I'm going to try to free hand a little sweater and see what I come up with. BUT I will be working on this pattern with some appropriate yarn."
"^_^ I certainly done want to endure pain. I was wanting to use my size 15 needles. I have abandoned such dreams for now. "
"I just finished up a few things, but now I'm working on a leaf cowl for my mom!  Hopefully I can finish before my winter break is over!  Ravelry project page: http://www.ravelry.com/projects/Rieslingmeyer/vite-cowl-2"
"Thank you for the tip. I feel like I'm doing that, but maybe I'm not pulling it tight enough. I keep on hoping it will get better with more practice."
"*needles!  Sorry.   I love the idea of interchangeables and I think it's time.  What should I look for in a set? "
"I'm new to knitting so I picked something that looked pretty but pretty easy for my first real project. I'm working on the [Simply Knit - one stitch lace scarf] (http://www.ravelry.com/projects/rayechu/simply-knit---one-stitch-lace-scarf). I've done about 2 feet, and the metallic yarn that I am using is pretty in person but a bit hard to photograph with a phone camera. \nIt's been a learning experience, but I feel like the many mistakes I've made thus far aren't super noticeable, so it is a pretty forgiving pattern. "
"Thanks. I'll have to put them in a format that other people could use. I can look into putting them on ravelry, I've never uploaded a pattern or chart. "
"Yeah, there may be a fix I don't know of!  If you do translate the pattern, you have to be careful of increases/decreases too and take the gauge into account.\n\nWhat I would do, because I am impatient and lazy, would be to find a pattern already written in that size!  \n\nI did a quick search on rav for \"pet\" and ticked off size 15 needles and there are a few doggie coats in there.  Search results [here](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/search#needles=10.0mm&amp;view=captioned_thumbs&amp;sort=popularity&amp;pc=pet).\n\nEdit:  You can figure out yarn weight via the wraps per inch method [here](http://www.craftsy.com/blog/2013/11/determining-yarn-weights/).  Also, the knitty gauge swatch tutorial [here](http://knitty.com/ISSUEspring03/FEATswatchout.html)."
"Blocking can help k1p1 ribbing fantastically. If you need some blocking resources I can dig up a few (though it looks like you've been crocheting for a while, so you probably already block stuff)."
"I don't think she's posted it yet, I'm eager to read about it as well. Such jealousy!!"
"I am taking a mitten, glove etc. class on [craftsy](http://www.craftsy.com/) and it's wonderful.  I learned a new trick for casting on dpns that saved my life and I'm already getting ready to decrease the top of my first mitten.  Before the class, I could never get past the first row or sometimes even get them cast on.\n\nif you have the means to pay for a class, I've been very happy with the class thus far and they go over a bunch of techniques.  The have sales a lot too, I got my for 50% off."
"Here is a decent video I made for knitting with DPN's showing the correct position of the needles as well as how to keep the first two stitches tight in order to avoid ladders.\n \nShow in American as well as continental methods of knitting.  In the video I am using a size 4 needle and worsted weight yarn.  This was for teaching a class--personally I use fingering weight and size 1 needles that are bamboo or wood and the stitches do not slide off.  I love DPN's for socks! Also good for small sleeves or finishing the tops of hats.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKML2EdAFPM"
"If you can get through the cast on and the first few rows, it gets *way* easier.  And once you get a couple inches done, the structure of the item keeps the dpns in a much more square formation and then it gets really easy.  It's just that first little bit that is terrible.  Curse-inducing terrible."
"I cast on [Snawheid](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/snawheid) earlier this week. It's my third colourwork project and halfway through the snowflake I finally found a way to hold the yarn so it tensions properly. But I'm concentrating too hard on making the floats not too tight that now they're too loose. Oh well. [Pic](http://images4.ravelrycache.com/uploads/pokdej/203894636/photo_1_medium.JPG).  \nI'm using Cascade Heritage in Mango and Heritage Silk in Cerulean."
"I'm still plugging away at [Cocktail](http://www.ravelry.com/projects/Helluvamimi/cocktailjumper) - I'm about 2 rounds away from starting the increases.  I was really looking forward to switching over to the Hiya Hiya interchangables that hubby got me for the holidays, but of course I'm using the one needle size not included in the small set (US 2.5), so I ordered the tip and will switch over this week.\n\nThis morning I CO [Fibonacci](http://www.ravelry.com/projects/Helluvamimi/fibonacci) as part of a KAL (it actually qualifies in 3 different KALs so go me) and so I think it's going well.  I had to make a slight adjustment as to which stitches were on which needles so that I wouldn't have a long float over the needle breaks, but otherwise I'm good (I think).\n\nAnd just because they're so damn cute, [these](http://www.ravelry.com/projects/Helluvamimi/baby-eyelet-socks) are the baby socks I finished up just before ringing in the new year on my couch.  You can't really see the eyelet pattern at all, but they look textured, and I'm ok with it."
"Try it with laceweight yarn and starting a lace project in the center with 8 sts!  I have done a bunch, and it never gets easier--but once you get the first couple of rounds done, it goes fine.  Love doing lacework, nevertheless!"
"Check out the advanced techniques page on knittinghelp.com. The hardest part with dpns is the first few rowa, once you get past the awkwardness, it's smooth sailing!"
"Oh my gosh. I wish I could give you more than one upvote. You have portrayed how I feel exactly!! Genius. \n\nI did DPNs for awhile and got okay at it. I just never enjoyed the project as much as I do when I do magic loop. Everyone has their things they like to do. DPNs just aren't my thing. \n\nBut anyway, thank you for the post!"
"I tend to set my knitting goals really small (and realistic) so that I don't get frustrated or upset when they aren't realized.\n\nThat being said, my first goal is to finish [Cocktail](http://www.ravelry.com/projects/Helluvamimi/cocktailjumper) in time for Rheinbeck (definitely do-able).  Though it's only the sleeves, it'll be the first real lace project I've done.\n\nGoal #2 is to partake in the [Op-Art Socks KAL](http://www.ravelry.com/groups/op-art-socks).  Basically every month you start a new pair socks out of the book (done in order for less confusion), and then have 2 months to complete the pair.  I CO my first pair this morning, so I'm of to a good start.\n\nGoal #3 is the most difficult - stop impulse buying all the yarns!!"
"Here is the video with a good demonstration of  a YO, SSK and K2TOG.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRSd6mb6DUs\n\nThe Haruni shawl is a very popular shawl on Ravelry.  Is beautiful, knit in a fingering, not laceweight yarn; and the pattern is written so a knitter relatively new to lace, can knit this.  It is a free download.\n\nThe pattern is Haruni Shawl by Emily Ross and the yarn is Louet Gems fingering weight in Willow and Fern green.\nYou can easily see the difference blocking makes--look at the triangular (light green) leaves in the video and how they look in the FO!\nBlocking lace is MAGICAL.\n"
"I think I knit \"continental\"  I think I hard someone call it. I knit right to left, but my yarn and tension is controlled in my right hand. I have tried it the other way and it's just not consistent. I think it actually makes me a faster knitter because my motions to wrap the yarn around are smaller. This way I can follow videos but still have all the control in my left hand"
"I have a set of Addi Click Turbo Lace Long tips and I love them because they are easier to use for work such as cables, knitting with lots of yo's/k2g's, etc... then the regular ones (which have a dull, rounded tip). I previously had a set of boye interchangeables and hated them because yarn was always getting stuck in the joins. Even though the Addi Clicks were very expensive (I got them as a birthday gift), they were 100% worth it and no worries about yarn getting stuck in joins, ever! (they also have a set of crochet hooks you can click onto the cord which are super helpful for binding off or picking up dropped stitches)."
"- finish or rip out all my unfinished projects \n- try some color work\n- make more felted things (i've only done one so far)"
"knitting in the round is tricky. sometimes numbers and rows can get bogged down. Make sure you look at the stitch you are about to work. In seed stitch if it looks like a \"v\" then you should purl it. if it is a bump right up next to the needle, then it should be a knit stitch. this way if you get off by one you can keep going without tearing it up and no one but you would probably notice. \nI hope this visual helps. I know I am a visual person\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/NjhcCx2.jpg\n\n\nwhen knitting in the round it's different than rows. If you just keep knitting you'll end up with a stockinet stitch so it's backwards. if you wanted to do a garter stitch you would have to alternate. Starting out makes you feel like everything you know about knitting is wrong! "
"I don't think you have to abandon the project.  You can learn some valuable information by doing it and still be able to use the yarn you want and size 15 needles.\n\nFirst knit up a gauge swatch--a quickie with reasonable reliability is to cast on about 25 sts.  I am assuming the doggie sweater is in stockinette stitch.  Knit for about 2.5 inches.  Now get a gauge or ruler, and lay across your stitches.  Count the number of stitches over 2 inches.  This is your stitch gauge.  Doubling your needle size also means paying attention to row gauge.  So place your rule vertically and count the rows for 2 inches--do not include the cast on or bind off edge.\n\nDivide the sts and rows by 2, and this is your gauge by inch.  Now multiply your number of sts/inch x the total width of your doggie sweater.\n\nThis will tell you how many stitches to cast on.  You can knit to the desired length.  I guess you will have to figure out where to put the openings for the doggie legs and your row gauge should help you with that.\n\nHope this helps--if you have any questions, while in progress--send me a note  :)"
"Alternatively, she has a stash like mine and that is a barely significant hunk.\n\nLeaving pets behind is really hard to accept though."

"Keep using up the stash. Get it down to a manageable level so I feel ok about buying new yarn again."
"I second these. I have the short tips, so I can use the 16\" cable, but I am very happy with them. The best part is that hey cannot accidentally come undone and don't require a key. \n\nThey are available at most LYS (which I love to support) but in this case, I bought mine from eBay and saved a bundle.

"Thank you!  It's a lot of fun to knit."
"Well, he built it. I helped."
"You're welcome!"
"I recently got the Harmony needles from Knitpicks, and I really like them. They are a nice color, and the tips are a lot sharper than my cheap bamboo ones. The wood also seems more firm than bamboo, which I like. The joins on them are very smooth, and so far they have not come apart."
"Hi, I know this is kind of reviving a pretty old post but I was just wondering...would you consider [this](https://www.etsy.com/listing/46388349/walnut-parasol-style-top-whorl-drop?ref=shop_home_active) to be a good spindle for a mostly-beginner? I've spun a little bit before, and I think I have an Schact bottom-whorl spindle. I'm mostly wanting a lighter one with a hook, since my current spindle doesn't actually have one, just a notch that I have to hook my yarn around."
"will do! I'm using a dark purple yarn with smokey black beads - it already looks pretty nice. But dang, last few rows of the pattern it's place a bead every other stitch and picot bind off - which I bet would look fantastic and totally worth it but I'll be crying while doing it."

"It really wasn't that hard, and it only took an hour or two. The supplies we used were a large lazy susan bearing as the base, two thick pieces of hardwood, a drill for the holes and attaching the pieces, dowels for the frame thing, and some screws to hold everything together. The hardest part was actually figuring out the structure--I didn't know about Amish-style swifts until I started googling for easy designs, so showing your friend a picture of an Amish swift would probably make everything go much faster. Also, neither me nor my father are professional woodworkers, so it would probably be much easier for your friend. Good luck, I hope you get your swift :)"
"I'm not completely sure that was the name of the store. My grandma has a pretty heavy slur because of her meds, and she said the name of it over the phone so it's very likely i misheard. The store was in central Texas. "
"I've had the harmony needles for over 4 years now and except for one that came with a bad tap (the screw wasn't made correctly) that they immediately replaced, it's been a great set.  I've got the harmony 6\" double point set as well and a couple of the fixed circulars (nothing smaller than a 4 comes in interchangable).\n\nI haven't tried any other interchangeables, but I never get annoyed at them and I'm always perfectly able to do all the stitches.  They're certainly better than the boyle fixed circulars I had used before I got the knitpicks ones!\n\nAnd if you don't like the colors, they come in a natural wood color and now in a blue-toned color as well."

"Things you can sew up practice squares/rectangles into:\n\n* fingerless mitts (make squares 7-8\" long on each side, fold in half, sew up on the side using both the cast-on and cast-off tails but leave a gap about 3/4 of the way up)\n* if cotton, sew two together around the edges to make a potholder or use one as a dishcloth (don't use artificial fibers or not-100%-cotton pieces! they might melt or burn)\n* coin purse (knit rectangle with sides at 2:1 ratio, seam up two of the sides to make a two-sided square, pass a cord/shoelace/another piece of yarn around the stitches near the top and use it as a drawstring)\n* glasses case (fold square into thirds, sew bottom third to middle third along both edges, install snap or button or loop so it will hold the top third down)\n\nThere are lots more ideas [here](http://www.squidoo.com/knitsquare)!"

"The knitpicks interchangeables don't go smaller than 24\" cable and 3.5mm (US4). It's fine for me since I prefer to knit on larger needles anyways and I dread the thought to knitting superfine stuff on superthin needles. If you do a lot of fine lacework or thin socks and such that might be a problem. "
"Wee! I still have a few things to make for people, but my self-imposed deadline is a bit more lenient. I am, however, working on a basic seed-stitch cowl for myself. I'm trying to get faster on circs. \n\nSo far it's still slow going.\n"
"Seed-stitch is always super slow for me too, but it's so pretty!! Worth it! Good luck! :)"
"What's the yarn? Acrylic? Wool? Cotton?"
"Any of the sets from KnitPicks. I originally got them so I could do magic loop (their cables are really flexible compared to the fixed circulars like Boye offers)\n\nI've had no problems with them what-so-ever. A friend of mine did have an end piece fall off the end of her cable but she sent KnitPicks an email and they replaced it for free immediately.\n\nAlso, they're on the cheaper end (price-wise) compared to the Addi-click (even though their needles look amazing and I one day dream of owning a set) and Knitters Pride. \n\nGood luck!"
"Wool. "
"I really want to knit myself a vintage style sweater. I'm struggling with resizing from tiny 50's size 10 to a huge modern (UK) size 18 so it will probably take me a couple of months! :s\n\n"
"Hot water and agitation will probably make it shrink, but that will probably also make it felt. And felt doesn't stretch.\n\nAre you absolutely certain it's supposed to be a hat?"
"If it hasn't been blocked or isn't a superwash, you might be able to shrink it. Block it (pin it to the dimensions you want) and use a hairdryer carefully."
"Beautiful!"
"I am fairly certain. I am not sure what else it would be... I am a guy so it isn't supposed to be a shall or something like that. "
"I am not 100% percent sure how to do that... Sorry. I don't personally knit at all. "
"I really like the bright colors. Beautiful."
"That makes it so you know the recipient will always like it!! :)"
"Gloves.  With fingers.  And I've already bought the conductive thread!\n\nDesign a new pattern is on the list.\n\nAnd Brioche stitch.  "
"I think I'm going to finally make myself an ear-flap hat! Yay for being warm!!"
":( I'm so jealous"
"WOW. That is stunning!"
"Oh yeah don't worry. I picked up on the sarcasm. I was just pointing out that the hat and scarf are worse."
"If you do a ravelry search for \"where the wild things are\" there's a few adult size sweaters and I think one that looks more like a body suit..."
"I would love addis but they're too expensive. I have the Nova nickel-plated deluxe set and I LOVE it."
"That looks like a great starter spindle and Spindler's Cottage is a familiar brand. The only thing I would recommend is to check with the seller if he can add a notch for you, I recommend directly behind the hook. It's not vital, but it does make things easier especially once you get a bit of spun yarn built up on the spindle."

"I'm SO excited.  I just cast on Vacouver Fog yesterday morning.  FOR MYSELF!!  The yarn is beautiful.  Chroma in the Mid Winter colourway.  The colours are so pretty.  I'm already done the first cab;e repeat, and halfway through the second of four in total.  On one glove.  But it's going quickly.  I'm just really excited to keep my next FO and not give it away!!"
"There's an amount of guilt and yearning that goes along with having a stash like this. Guilt that I feel like I'm hoarding yarn. Yearning for enough time to make stuff with it all!"
"I'm working on gifts still because I'm slow/had school. Very seriously considering adopting this policy seeing as I haven't actually knit anything for myself besides a few mistake ridden little things from when I was first starting to learn. "
"Soooo organized and cute! \n\nI'm thinking of getting a sewing machine this year so I can sew up cute, functional items like bags and cases for all my crocheting and knitting tools. Now they're stashed in a hodgepodge of cases that I've bought for varying purposes -- nothing consistent, really.\n\nWith 2 kids, 2 cats, and a dog (and less than immaculate housekeeping habits), if I had my yarn out for display it would be completely nasty/dusty/hairy within the space of a month. Not to mention the fact that it would be depressing at how little time I have to spend making the things I'd like to make. \n\nI'd rather keep it packed away and go visit every once in a while. :-)"
"you can't take them with you when you're going to the shelter, and arranging adoption of your pet is way too obvious a thing to do if what you need to do is *escape* your relationship"
"I am so jelly of the sublime yarn.  I adore bamboo yarn!! So soft, so strong.  It also has the most amazing drape.  With the silk blended in there, it's going to feel absolutely incredible.\n\nCongratulations for your wonderful haul!! And those are also some spectacular circular needles too.  Keep us posted on what you make with the yarn!"
"My 2 cents here: I store my yarn on a bookshelf (open) and 2 hanging baskets in my room. I too have 2 kids and 2 cats. They stay away from it from the most part and I haven't seen any dust accumulate. "
"Fair enough :) you ever want to get rid of any let me know :)\n\nI wish I had the money to get more"
"Making at least one cowl/scarf for myself and then some socks.  And next year I start all gifts at least two months earlier."
"I also stayed up late knitting. Boyfriend was sleeping (he wasn't feeling well) so we didn't really celebrate. I wasn't *planning* to stay up so late but I had this really boring (but quick) pattern I wanted to finish and between that and reddit, well... \n\nHappy New Year!"
"That was a very nice gift from your grandparents!\nYou can knit them something as a thank you."
"Pick a pattern you'll like. I chose something fairly boring ([Hermione's Everyday Socks](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/hermiones-everyday-socks)) and they've been sitting unfinished for *months* because I just don't want to knit them. I picked something a little more exciting ([Reykjavik Socks](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/reykjavik-socks)) and finished them in just under a month.\n\nFind a pattern that has things you can do and knit that. Don't pick something easy and boring, especially if you have motivation problems (Hi! I'm the poster child for that.) because you'll never want to finish them."
"I FULLY SUPPORT THIS"
"There's another one I'm looking at ([this one](https://www.etsy.com/listing/120198471/walnut-pavilion-style-top-whorl-drop?ref=shop_home_active)) that *does* have a notch on it. Would it be better to go with that one?"
"holy moly, that's what a truly confident knitter looks like. I think my heart stopped when she yanked on that thread!"
"I would think that if you'd met \"bad people,\" you wouldn't be so quick to demonize a guy for selling yarn. It sounds like you haven't even considered that she was a part of the problem. \n\nYou need to look at both sides of a story before coming to a conclusion, and with the lack of information presented, your conclusion that he's the problem, and an abuser, is not only wrong, but harmful.\n\nIf what I say isn't doing it for you, how about hearing from someone that met him?\n\n\n&gt;As many of you hoarleins will remember, I snagged the “17.2lbs of ex-gf’s” yarn. I have not had a chance to weigh it yet but I have just returned from my adventures with Tom, the Magical Yarn-Hater! He actually exists!\n\n&gt;But what you and everyone else may love a laugh at, is I asked him to indulge me with a picture to which his reply was, ”I’d rather not be on that site.” He is no mere monster, but really just a jilted man with a newly found distaste for fiber. **I will not make assumptions to his character aside from that.**\n\nEmphasis mine."
"wow, the variegated colorway looks so good with that pattern!"
"hm, it could be that they just put down the yardage of the ball they used? ie, they didn't use it all but just rounded up because 440 is the smallest amount you can have in that particular yarn?"
"Serious question here, how do you justify having that much yarn? Do you ever plan on using all of it to the point of having no stash, or do you just buy more and more for fun even if you can't knit/crochet all of it? "
"I haven't used straight needles in years. "
"If you have some skeins that you reeeally want to wind but don't have the winder yet, I've found this [method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1r1eYsqeMV0&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player) works fairly well in a pinch. "
"I've done this before with a size 19 knitting needle, but I just ordered 2200 yards of lace-weight yarn and don't think it's practical. It works really well for bulky and worsted, but not as well for lace, as the cake tends to take hours and hours to wind. I'll probably just end up knitting from the swift, since the project I'm about to start is going to get quite large (hence the 2200 yards). Of course, the method you linked will probably be much, much easier with a swift, as opposed to getting tangled around my chair :P"
"Happy New Year!\n\nI am a new knitter, only been at it for a few weeks. And I decided to take on a cable stitch scarf. No pattern, just winging it as I go. The yarn is some stuff I had in a tub, no idea where it came from, I just thought that it was pretty. Here is a picture of it, http://i.imgur.com/nVmXQ5J.jpg and any pointers are more than welcome. "
"If you like doing really small sweaters, you should get in touch with your local hospitals. They often can use preemie-sized items, as the parents wouldn't have anything the right size."
"You can generally change a pattern to accommodate a different tension, and this includes using a different yarn. However there is a limit. My main concern would be that the style that would work for a worsted weight yarn wouldn't be great for bulky or super-bulky yarn. It's less of an issue with pet clothes (not a lot of styling), but it won't look the same at all, and there's a risk that there will be too much bulk somewhere."
"Just got stash2go and I love it! You can see forums and pattern info!"
"That's what kept happening to my sister in law when I tried teaching her. Whenever it happens to me I just knit two together to prevent loose stitches. "
"I'm glad you're enjoying it :D"
"Hmm, I'm glad you posted this as it didn't really cross my mind to come up with knitting goals!\n\nI want to:\n\n* knit cabled mittens (practice cabling)\n* re-knit my favorite shawl that I lost (already have the yarn!)\n* knit a fair-isle sweater\n* knit each of my immediate family members a present for Christmas\n* experiment with pattern design (should be easier now that I have a machine)\n* fix the super complicated shawl that I dropped a stitch on and then wadded up in a drawer because I was too mad\n* do a KAL (mystery one if I can find one)\n"
"Me too, mostly because I'm so slow...and because I'm never sure if the recipient would like the gift.  Easier to just knit for myself."
"My work collects purple hats to give away to new babies to promote [period of purple crying awareness](http://clickforbabies.org/). I work for the department of health so we do the giving away, but I am sure they collect from other sources as well."
"Just finishing the edging on my French Cancan, made with Blue Sky Alpaca's Metalico. This yarn is *decadent*. The ultimate selfish January project :)"
"Actually I like this idea! I was a preemie baby, so that really appeals to me. Thanks!"
"I just got a set of [Clover interchangeables] (http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004V7JFUY/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&amp;colid=10HRYPM71Q3BT&amp;coliid=I5LC6903CVH4I) for Christmas, and so far they are awesome! I like bamboo (I can't deal with how slippery metal is -- my stitches fall off everywhere) and I have a lot of the individually packaged Clover needles, so I thought this would be a quality set. It has a bunch of different needle sizes (3-15) and cord lengths (16, 24, 29, 36 and 48-inch). I really wanted a set that included the 16-inch cord. I've been knitting a project with them for the past few days, and the join has stayed tight and I haven't had any issues with it unscrewing and coming loose. It also comes in a really nice case to keep things organized. They've also been half off on Amazon for a really long time ($85 instead of 169). Overall, very happy and satisfied! "
"I like this idea, but unfortunately there aren't any organizations in my state. Hopefully one gets started, because I definitely would do that!"
"I'll check to see if there are any clothing banks near me. Thank you!"
"Thank you both, for your kind comments."
"This is exactly what it feels like the first time! I laughed my ass off.  Cheer up... it gets much, much easier with time, OP!"
"Wow, this is a lot more information than I was expecting! I love all of these ideas, thank you so much!"
"What an awesome idea!!!"
"There might be something organized. The only contacts for my state are in Tulsa and I know that the woman in my building collects them and we are located in Oklahoma City.\n\n"
"Look, you can believe whatever you want. Just please stop arguing with me. I have explained under what circumstances I would ditch near 18 pounds of yarn and a cat, over and over again, based on my experience, and I'm not going to change my mind about that. it's exactly the circumstances under which I would abandon the materials for a cherished hobby and a beloved animal. If you'd abandon those things for the same reason or a different one, that's -fine.- But dude gives me the wigguns and I think he's playing the beleagured victim of a crazy/stupid/lazy/ugly burden who wasn't worth the shit on his shoe.\n\nPlease stop telling me that I should not hold my values in such a way. It's been going on for hours and I'm tried of explaining myself. I have not gone after anyone for believing his story, but I have not been extended the same courtesy. stop. please. with sugar on top."
"You're welcome!"
"I contacted the website, hopefully they can help me figure out what I can do!"
"[deleted]"
"I own sets of: Boye, knitpicks harmony wood, knitpicks nickel\n\nBoye: had them for years, they are metal they work well, cords are very stiff, you can join multiple cords together, joins come unscrewed if you don't do them tight\n\nKP wood: I have only had this set for two weeks, they feel like they are going to break if I force a stitch too much, cords are extremely flexible, can't join multiple cords w/o buying extenders, yarn (acrylic) slides easily, tips are pointy, they have a hole for lifeline thread\n\nKP nickel: had them for a couple years, my fingers exude a lot of acidity so the finish wore off on them so I stopped using them, extremely flexible cords, can't join multiple w/o buying extenders, have a lifeline hole\n\nThe KP products are compatible with Knitter's Pride interchangeable needles and cords.\n\nMy favorite set would be the nickel set, but I am trying to find a set that I like (and can use) better than the boye.  I prefer metal to wood needles."
"Me too ! I was like \"noooooooooooooo!!!!!\" I don't see myself ever doing that! Haha!"
"Can you let me know how much of the Chroma you have left when you're done. I have 2 balls of Mochi plus. It's pretty close to Chroma in size but, each ball is 95 yards so, it's going to be pretty darn close."
"I started a Haruni, after making my mom a hat, my cousins daughter a crochet bag, and a few arm knit scarves. "
"I love my ChiaoGoo Lace interchangeable set. When I purchased my set, I read this [review](http://www.stitchedtogether.co.uk/2013/02/chiaogoo-twist-interchangeable-lace.html) and I was sold.\n  \nPros:  \n-One of the few sets that go down to a size 2 and up to a size 15.  \n-Built in lifeline holes in the needles  \n-Different cable sizes for the smaller and larger needles, meaning the smaller needles take a smaller diameter cable  \n-Smooth joins from needle to cable  \n-Various cable lengths included: 24\", 32\", 40\"  \n-Various goodies included: stitch markers, cable connectors, cable stoppers, needle gauge/ruler  \n-Comes in a nice case with pockets  \n-Needle gauge printed (engraved?) on needle  \n  \nCons:  \nHaven't found any yet  \n  \nI see these as Pros as well, opinions may vary:  \n-Twisted steel cables  \n-Stainless steel needles  \n  \nI also have a set of KP Zephyr needles that I like. These were my first pair. When I moved, I thought I had lost (misplaced them) and bought the ChiaoGoo Lace set, but about 8 months after the fact, found my Zephyr set again."
"My vote as well, make sure to get the lace tips!"
"Blocking is essentially getting it wet then drying it in the shape you want, check YouTube for tutorials on how to do this without felting the hat. Someone else has already noted, felted wool won't stretch but is still very warm!"
"I think this is a great idea! On the Knitmore girls podcast recently they talked about tossing out the idea of \"Selfish knitting\" It's your hobby make something for who you want not who you think you should. If you want to make something for yourself embrace it! Make yourself something beautiful. \n\nMy next two projects are a pair of Vancouver mitts for me and a shawl for my wife. I hope to have them both done this month."
"I already made myself the eleventh hour scarf, now I want one in every color. Good thing it only took half a day to do :)\n\nIm working on a cabled headband now, and want to do this tentacle-y scarf thing. Or a sweater. I mean, I got a dressform might as well use it..."
"OK, this is my best shot without being able to read the $5 pattern:\n\n1. I think yes, you are meant to do this in the round. The increases are there to shape the knitting round the point. (And the pattern is listed as seamless, though that might not be definitive for just a few inches of seaming.)\n\n2. Yes, do as it says.\n\n3. No, you can do any type of M1 or increase that you like, but the pattern author thinks M1 is appropriate, and the matched pair probably look best. A KFB is asymmetric, so probably would look odd.\n\n4. \"Garter stitch\" is the name of a type of *fabric* made by knitting in a specific way -- a poor name but we are stuck with it. On straight needles you make garter stitch fabric by doing the knit stitch on all rows. This gives you a fabric that, when you look at it, has alternate rows of knit and purl, because the back of a knit row is the same thing as a purl row. If you are knitting in the round, then you make garter stitch fabric by using the knit stitch for one round and the purl stitch for the next. So you make that edging how you like -- straight or in the round, and choose the stitch to use for each row/round accordingly. On every second row/round do the two increases -- and most people find it convenient to choose a knit row/round to do them on. (\"...pick up row?\" confuses me -- I hope you mean on these new rows/rounds that you are knitting after picking up the stitches once when you started the edging.)\n\n5. If you are picking up on a slanting edge it is usually best to divide the edge into quarters or even smaller divisions and work out how many stitches you  need to pick up in each section. It makes things more even.\n\n6. [This link](http://www.knitty.com/ISSUEwinter04/FEATwin04TT.html) may tell you more that you wanted to know about picking up and knitting stitches. If you do it from the right side of the knitting, that will form the first knit row of your garter stitch fabric. As this is bulky yarn you may find it easier to use a crochet hook to make the loops.\n\n\nEDIT: It looks a fun pattern, good luck with it, and do show us the finished work!\n"
"I'm new....What is this and how is it used? Good job going DIY.  Did you follow plans or make up the design?"
"I was very selfish this year.  I did knit for others just not as much as I did in 2012.  I made a sweater for one son, a sweater for the other son's girlfriend, spun yarn for my daughter who knits, made some small projects for friends who appreciate my work, but the rest of the year I knitted for my self.  I made a lace shawl, two sweaters and a cowl, pair of matching gloves and at least one pair of socks.  Have a another sweater, socks and a cowl in progress right now, and yes they all for me.  Spring projects are lined up as well. :)  Knitting selfishly isn't bad.  "
"This hat is in the lost &amp; found at my work. I'm intrigued by the way the colorwork was done. It almost looks like double knitting. Does anyone know how this was accomplished, and/or what this technique is called? Thanks!"
"Wow, thanks! This is amazing advice. \n\nAnd yes, that's what I mean by \"pick up rows.\" You'll have to excuse me, I'm still pretty new to this, haha.  "
"I'm making a pair of half-finger gloves in City Tweed DK, with the Brocade color way. I am so excited to make myself some of these! I'm afraid I won't have enough yarn though(230 yards?) so we'll see :)"
"I am stunned by the beauty and simplicity of this essay."
"As well as a couple WIP's for other people, I'm starting a sweater, hat, and shawl for myself this month.  No guarantee any of the ME projects will be completed in January, but I'll at least have them started!"
"I really like how you blocked it. It is one of those shawls that can be blocked in a few ways. I've been planning on doing a Haruni ever since I started knitting more. Sometimes I see FOs and I'm not so sure I want to make it, but then I see ones blocked like yours and I remember why I fell for it in the first place!"
"Hiya Hiya Steel Sharp. I love them so much. They are durable sharp and un complicated. They come in sizes 2-15 US and you can buy either the small sizes or big ones. "
"My current storage solution is two 3-shelf bookshelves from Target (on sale they're only $15 a piece!), a bunch of clear storage bins of varying sizes, and a 3-drawer plastic storage chest.  All yarn not in use goes in the bins and then onto the shelves. Needles, buttons, and other accessories into the drawers.  WIP's, special yarns, or other small items go in wicker type baskets on the top shelf.  Here's some pics of when I first set it up, but the stash has since grown to needing the second bookshelf.  http://imgur.com/a/0D4gl"
"Seconding the Hiya Hiya suggestion!  They're amazing."

"Sorry. The jealousy trick won't work with non jealous children. If she is that independant, about all you can do is involve her in the process. Maybe if she chooses the yarn, color, pattern and is told repeatedly that it is for her, it might work. I raised only boys. I made a lot of clothes for teddy bears and He-man dolls. I only got to play dress up with my nieces and friends daughters. They loved the things I gave them. I guess I have no idea how to get your girl to cooperate. Wish you luck in your future attempts. I'd wear the adorable things you make but Granny isn't that lucky. :)"
"My thinking is that this is a stranded knitting chart. I would say the rule for stranded knitting is floats of a maximum of about 5 stitches, but you can stretch that a little if you are using real non-superwash wool that is \"grabby\", or if you are are using it somewhere where fingers won't get caught in the loops.\n\nI think it is significant that the longest stretches of one colour here seem to be 10 stitches or less. I reckon the swirls and even some of the antler tines are where they are to keep the stretches down to this distance -- possible for one float with a twist to hold it in place, or two twists in some of them, as you can't stack the twists in the same place for fear of them showing through.\n\nDon't let me stop you practicing your intarsia skills, though!"
"I'm finally going to finish a pair of socks. I've got some gorgeous madtosh, and I'm going to be making these [pomatomus](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/pomatomus) socks!"
"Oh, they joys of Christmas knitting being over. \n\nI finished [Lady Sunshine](http://images4.ravelrycache.com/uploads/AtomicAthena/202003660/IMG_20131219_194718_332_medium2.jpg) just in time for my sister ([my page](http://www.ravelry.com/projects/AtomicAthena/lady-sunshine), and [pattern page](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/lady-sunshine)), as well as [Autumn's End](http://images4-d.ravelrycache.com/uploads/AtomicAthena/203766842/IMG_20131231_174522_779_medium2.jpg) for my friend who recently moved across the country ([my page](http://www.ravelry.com/projects/AtomicAthena/autumns-end), and [pattern page](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/autumns-end)). Both at the very last minute, of course!\n\nNow, it's time to knit for me! I started [Endpaper Mitts](http://images4-b.ravelrycache.com/uploads/AtomicAthena/203989738/IMG_20140101_153415_587_medium2.jpg) as my first foray into stranded colorwork, and so far, so good! ([my page](http://www.ravelry.com/projects/AtomicAthena/endpaper-mitts), and [pattern page](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/endpaper-mitts))\n\nI just ordered some Wool of the Andes yarn from KnitPicks in a gorgeous blue-purple heather to start [Laura](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/laura-20), my first sweater for me!"
"i might make some mittens"
"Looks like intarsia I think."
"[deleted]"
"It looks like a machine-knit version of carrying your floats? I have no idea how they did the k1p1 pattern on the back, but yeah, double-knitting or some close variant would be my guess."
"Justification: Blankets. I make LOTS of blankets. (Crocheted, so that takes more than knitting -- I'm amazed at how far my yarn goes when I knit!) And I'm really busy during most of the year (I'm a teacher &amp; a mom), so I don't have time to run to the store when I'm ready to start a new project AND I only buy yarn when it's on sale &amp; have excellent coupons &amp; get free shipping -- so when I buy, I buy a lot at once.\n\nWhen I run through all of the Stylecraft DK, I most likely won't buy any more. I bought it specifically to re-create projects from the Lucy @ Attic24 website. If I'm going to make big stuff, I'd just as soon use worsted weight because it goes faster. But I wanted to try this stuff and have plenty of colors to use. \n\nNow, I WILL say that there is a whole bin in there of Caron Simply Soft that I bought pretty much \"because it was there,\" and it was *seriously* cheap (like less than $2/skein cheap). I actually do use quite a bit of it for amigurumi stuff, but that takes just a little bit at a time. I'm on the verge of putting it up for sell/trade on Ravelry, but I don't think I'll ever just dump it all -- not as long as I have space for it and it's not really hurting anything being there.\n\nThe nice stuff that I have... That's the most intimidating. I don't feel good enough at knitting to start making good use of it yet, and I'm not sure when that time will come. I DID crochet myself up a quick (and marvelous) cowl out of half a skein of Malabrigo Silky Merino -- I'd definitely do that again in a heartbeat!\n"
"Very nice! I especially like the chest of drawers used for needles &amp; notions. I got a really nice rolling cart on a good sale ($30, usually $80) but just haven't quite figured out what to do with it. I am TOTALLY going to steal your idea and put my \"hardware\" in there. It'll be perfect!"
"Hmm... this seems interesting. Thanks. I'll try it for now, but it's not exactly the thing I was looking for. I mean, it'll probably look the same, and it's very similar, but I was just wondering what the other method was. The one I remember has the last stitch completely normal, and after slipping the first stitch in some way, you twist the yarn around it..."
"You said you were going to do colorwork, didn't you? I think I remember that, because colorwork is definitely on my list to learn/try this year, too.\n\nTo chew down my stash, I'm going to make more blankets, probably small ones, and start giving them as baby gifts. There are THREE pregnant ladies teaching 7th grade right now, and while I'm not really close to any of them,  I don't think it could hurt to share some yarny love down the hallway. :-)"
"Your shawl looks beautiful. I've just started the [Haruni scarf](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/haruha-scarf) but think I might frog and do the shawl instead. Thanks for including the video."
"I still have a Christmas gift to finish (lace scarf, why did I think this was smart?), a birthday gift for the roomie, and a welcome-to-my-cold-city gift for a friend moving to town.\n\nAfter that, I'm planning on a pair of fingerless mitts for myself, this [Etch-a-Sketch](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/etch-a-sketch-ipad-cover) cover but altered for my laptop, and [this slouch hat](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/parisian-slouch-hat)."
"I need to build one of these. This would surely beat standing with my arms out like Frankenstein's monster while my sweetie winds balls of yarn. "
"I'm pretty proud of them despite the shabbiness -- and it was encouraging that my second mitten turned out much much better.  For my next project I think I will try something smaller and simpler to work on perfecting my stitches and tension a bit more. These will be for me only, not good enough to gift yet :)"
"Definitely looks like double knitting. It's cool that they limited the double knit to just the patterned area. I've never though of that. Doesn't look too hard to do either, if you're already able to double knit. My best guess is you decide where the pattern's going to go and cast on a CC stitch every other MC stitch for however wide the pattern needs to be, then resume normal knitting until you get to the double knit spot again. I can only imagine it being done flat then seamed though, since the working yarn will be at the wrong end of the pattern once you come a full round. Did you find a seam on it? "
"You could always get a nostepinne and wind by hand. pretty quick once you get the knack. Pretty easy to improvise one too"
"Holy crap that's amazing! And gorgeous pattern. I can't wait to see how yours turns out once it's blocked. How big is it now and how far from finished is it?"
"the reaction to what I said worries me, but I remember what it was like to be in an abusive relationship. No one believed me, everyone believed him - except the medical personnel who saw me."
"If you get really fancy, you could even label each drawer so you know exactly what items should go in each place."
"When I got my interchangable circular set I thought I'd never use straights again. Turns out I prefer the feel of the straights for knitting flat, probably because I knit really weird and support the needles with my legs"
"I suggest doing it, it only took about two hours to make. However, my dad is a pretty skilled woodworker, so I'm not sure what your skill level is and how long it would take. If you don't have the skill, materials, or time, you could also surprise your partner and buy one instead, although they can be fairly expensive."
"I use clear plastic sweater boxes with a quarter sheet of paper stuck in the end to label what's inside, like \"cotton\" or \"chemo caps\"."
"She does have a birthday coming up..."
"My current WIP is my first ever knitted sweater. The one I did 15 years ago as a kido doesn't count right? :)  \n\n[Kyra Boatneck Pullover](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/kyra-boatneck-pullover)  \n[My Project Page](http://www.ravelry.com/projects/bibite/kyra-boatneck-pullover)  \n\nI am using Knit Picks [Wool of the Andes Tweed](http://www.knitpicks.com/cfYarns/Yarn_Display.cfm?ID=5420211&amp;media=RAV&amp;utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=marketing&amp;utm_campaign=RAV) in colour Brass Heather on 4.5mm and 5.5mm needles. I am going to have to order 2 more balls of yarn, so this is currently on hold. I got as far as one sleeve, the front, and most of the back done before running out. Nothing is bound off just yet, just sitting on cables   \n\nSuper easy knit but the seaming terrifies me. Love the colour, and I have super high hopes for this."
"I've used one before with worsted and bulky, and it works great. The real reason I built this is because I'm getting 2200 yards of lace yarn for a big project, and I know it will get horrifically tangled and take hours to finish a ball if I use this method. I'm probably going to end up knitting straight from the swift instead of winding it, since the project is going to get big fast."
"I do this too, good use for empty toilet paper rolls.\n\nI haven't got a swift though, so I usually sit on floor with legs straight, and have the skein between my feet. "
"Oooh! 2200 yards of lace!?! Now I'm curious to see what yarn and project you're working with!"
"I finished mine too! So cozy!"
