"Your body loses water when exercising. This is a fact. Lose too much and you are in for a shitty race, or much worse.  Please do not spread the idea that hydration during long runs is an option. The need for proper hydration is well-evidenced. An example:\n\n*\"... you lose water through sweating when you exercise.  A good rule of thumb is that you lose around half a litre for each hour that you exercise – and it can be substantially more than this if it is a hot day.\n\nSome evidence shows that modest levels of dehydration lead to significant falls in athletic performance.[i] Your blood is about 82% water.  As you sweat more, your volume of blood is reduced, and your cardiovascular system works less efficiently at getting oxygen to your muscles.  A loss of water equal to 2% of your body weight (a litre and a half for a 75kg person) could reduce your aerobic capacity by up to 20%.[ii] Bigger sweat losses than this can lead to dangerous dehydration.\"*\n\nhttp://www.runningforfitness.org/book/chapter-7-eating-drinking-and-running/drinking-while-running"

"For training runs, go slower on your long runs.  It's the duration, not the intensity, that matters most for building endurance.  An easier pace means a quicker recovery, so your subsequent workouts are higher quality.  That will lead to faster overall progress.\n\nIf you want to go fast, save it for a one-day-a-week tempo run or intervals.\n"
"Don't tense your abs or butt when you run.  It's good to feel your hamstrings and glutes \"activate\" when you run:  they're the major muscle groups involved when you're running on the flats.  But they shouldn't be tense.  \n\nYou might also feel your abs working:  they're \"core\" muscles that stabilize your torso.  A strong core is important to good running form.  But again, your abs shouldn't be too tense.\n"
"My brother is an exercise scientist and was completely baffled by the 1 g/lb. he thought maybe some fitness buff misinterpreted or poorly converted the 1 g/kg of bodyweight that has some science behind it.\n\nSo, i know that number is quoted all the time over on /r/fitness and it drives me bonkers because as far as I can tell there's no evidence to back it up. I don'tthink you need nearly that much, particularly if you're focusing on distance running. With your bodyweight, 100 g a day would be about right for you. My brother said even 1 g/kg is on the high end and usually only recommended for strength-focused athletes."

"That's another thing you'll want to experiment with. There are a ton of different products - some people even hate gels and go for the chews instead. I finally settled on Gu Lemon Sublime (no caffeine) or Gu Mandarin Orange (a tiny bit of caffeine). I didn't like the Double Latte or Chocolate because it tasted like a mouthful of cake batter every 40 minutes. \n\nHonestly, they're all pretty similar - about 100 calories of sugar that is easily digested. Just find what's cheap and go from there.\n\nThere are more pure runners who eschew gels and mid-race fuelling entirely. They have a good point, as these products are relatively new inventions. To me (a strictly front of the middle of the pack runner), they help. It's a question of preference, like listening to music while you run. Some say it's just plain wrong, others like myself think great music is just a natural while out (if you're out for a hard, fast run The Dark Knight soundtrack is killer)."

"Disclaimer: this is pretty moronic. \n\nI don't mind running through puddles, on gravel, or even in dry snow. Yet somehow, I still haven't figured out how to run downhill on wet pavement. I always feel like I am on the brink of slipping on the slick surface and therefore I consciously limit my speed downhill. I'm especially aware of this when running on less-frequented roads that often have a thin, smooth layer of moss on the sides. How does one run down a wet hill without slowing down or wiping out?"

"hill sprints will be better than nothing, but i highly highly doubt that you don't have time for a run a few days per week.\n\nit doesnt take much time to go for a run. just make all of your runs faster. 20 minute tempo for example, with a few minutes warmup and another few to cool down a bit."

"This American Life is made up of multiple \"acts\" (stories) easy week, usually on an abstract theme like \"luck\" or \"pets.\" The stories are a mix of long-form documentary reporting, occasional current events, and some fiction (clearly marked as such.)\n\nI can't think of another program (radio or tv) to compare it to. Maybe a more touchy-feely 60 minutes? But it's different than a news program, because of its unabashed editorializing and fourth-wall-breaking voice; for example \"stop and think about that for a minute; that's over a millions transactions per second\" etc. \n\nRadiolab is usually more focused, dealing with a particular science topic each week. Less human interest of current events. Radiolab make a more use of audio effects and audio editing andlotsofcrosstalk."

"The point of aerobic is that you stay aerobic. Sprinting is anaerobic, which means you're muscles are using its energy stores faster than it can replenish them. Aerobic training is conditioning your muscles to better supply energy while it's being used up. So still no. Also, jogging down will just put more impact on your knees. My suggestion, if possible, designate a long run day out of the week. Go out for at least 10 miles, no more than 14. Start off at 7, and increase by a mile each week until you hit the max amount you want for that day. Keep the pace light and easy. "

"Ran my first Mudder this past year and I was instantly hooked. I've got 4 on the books for 2014 already. Running is only part of it. I'd suggest throwing some core and strength training into your plan. You're gonna want to conserve your energy between obstacles, so I guess tailor your foot strike accordingly? You should have plenty of time to acclimate to altitude running and temperature. You're going to want some good \"stay dry\" clothes like UnderArmour. I'd suggest some compression running pants to help protect your shins. Some people run the TM with gloves, others no. I went to the dollar store and picked up some cheap rubber palmed garden gloves and cut the fingers and thumb out.. they actually worked like a champ. I wouldn't recommend buying brand new shoes to run in. You want something that's broken in and comfortable. Long socks and duct tape around the shoes. Check out /r/Toughmudder/ for more tips and advice. You're gonna have a blast."

"With out using a surveyor's wheel to prove all of this... I would say they   should be more accurate than your GPS watch... theory.\n\nFirst let me address my assertion a treadmill is more accurate than a GPS watch  by pointing you to [GPS Accuracy](http://www.gps.gov/systems/gps/performance/accuracy/) and [Error analysis for the Global Positioning System](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_analysis_for_the_Global_Positioning_System).\n\nOkay, now the topic at hand when my parents bought me my first real bicycle as a teenager I somehow I manged to talk them into also buy the nifty little LCD gadget that would give me the time, speed and distance. I think I assured them it would help me make it home on time for dinner. Needless to say as a geek I thought the device was magical and just had to figure out how it worked. Its simply two magnets one affied to the frame the other on a spoke, with each revolution of the wheel the two magents produce a small current and since the circumference of the wheel is known start doing some math you are able to acquire speed and distance; just like a surveyors wheel.\n\nJust like with the bike the treadmill manufacture knows all kinds of details regarding the motor and belt and are then able to figure out your speed and distance. However treadmills are mass produced in a factory with various tolerances and because of that some variation will accurate, this variation is a statistical round error unless you are running an insane distance.\n\nOf course for all practical purposes the data from both sources are more than reliable for the pro athlete and  the average “weekend” warrior alike. Oh, and I know I always feel like one could \"cheat\" their distance/speed which makes me question the treadmill at times... but I usally start thinking how one could do that out of boredom ;)"

"I love listening to podcast and one that that drives me NUTS is when someone says “If you are thirsty you are already dehydrated”. I'm sorry but that just sounds well, silly.

"Correct me if I'm wrong, as I often am, but doesn't current research show its best to rotate among different shoes types and style while running?I forget where I read/heard that. Also you might find different shoe types are best for different workouts/distances. Personally I tend to use the lower drop shoes for shorter runs with the higher drop shoes for my longer runs. I still mentally equate larger drops with more cushioning.\n\nRight now my personal rotation is comprised of Brooks Pure Flow,  Ghost and Defyance... along with two shoes from the brand we all hate, Skechers (GoRUN &amp; GoRUN Ultra). I believe the GoRUN has a 2mm (sans liner) drop while the Ghost as a 12mm drop so I am all over the place ;)\n\nI have a half and full marathon coming in days, single digits , and I'm finding myself loathing the Ghost and loving my newly acquired GoRUN Ultra's and I to  would love to try out the Altra Torin.

"The newest generation of mizuno shoes is much more firm with the new U4IC midsole, and I've found many customers (I fit people into running shoes) have had to go down half a size from their last model, as the shoe ends up being baggy in the toebox and/or bunched up in the bottom of the laces.  The new inspires supposedly have 27% more support (I believe this is the number) and many customers have said that the rear medial side of the shoe does feel stiffer, not in a bad way, but they can tell there is more support.  The lateral side also has a slight bevel, which during my test run of both the inspire and rider I felt did help to prevent the clop effect that I normally have in classic trainers when I supinate before making full ground contact.  Back to the issue of sizing/bagginess, one customer was very concerned about his toes being too close to the end when sizing down so that the upper hugged his foot correctly, so going with the larger size, his size from the inspire 9's, we were able to fix the bagginess and folding with a lacing trick by running up the first two eyelets rather than crossing the laces, which had the added benefit of allowing for full toe splay and enough extra lace to comfortably do a heel lock.\n\nApologies for the long winded response"

"Good advice "
"It's kind of weird but I know some people run inside malls. A mall I used to go to had signs specifically for it. "
"The most effective way would probably work on form changes/drills/correcting muscle imbalances and weaknesses. Mostly I would think that these values could be used to measure the effect that your attempts at improving your form is having. In theory working on form through drills, correcting muscle imbalances and weaknesses would should probably lower your ground contact time and vertical oscillation. So if it is actually working your numbers will go down eventually. \n\nI wouldn't worry to much about these numbers getting too low. Running in a way that they were too low would most likely feel very weird and awkward."
"In and out.  I've read that really whatever gets the air into your lungs and back out is OK. I tend to breathe through my mouth the whole way. "
"how about 7:15ish am, get in 30 minutes of running, then do your workout for soccer. just run easy and you should be nice and warmed up for your workout.\n\nalso, don't let the dark keep you from running. that's an easy thing to fix."
"If you really want to run it OR you are not racing most of the winter (I would advise collegiate runners to avoid doing this as they have indoors ahead)\n\n1. LAYER UP in warm up - when you have a cold, heating up during warm up will help tremendously.\n2. Don't even bother with a cool down and take at least the next 2-4 days off. you body is now battling 2 things: post-race recovery (typically easy running) and a cold (which is usually easy running or even time off). \n\nI remember when I doubled with the cold during indoors one year, I found myself struggling with workouts the week after and even finding myself with a forced day off or two.\n\nOther than the above, follow the best advice the others have posted on here and have a happy new years."

"This is more often than not an issue with calibration. Use a measuring wheel from distance 0, 0.1, 1.0 and 2.0. Record each value on different speeds. In some cases, a treadmill is good at one speed, but under at a faster speed or over at a slower one."
"This goes way beyond the scope of what you should ask the internet. This is really a question for a qualified medical professional, presuming you have access to one. "
"Good job, dude. Have an up vote"
"that's exactly the reason why. unless you're having post-run crashes on your normal runs, the simple reason is that you're pushing your body many times harder than you're used to. either get used to the crash (which honestly isn't very healthy) or start training more so you can handle the race! (and you'll end up running a hell of a lot faster, too)"
"Agreed on iSmoothRun's benefits. It measures cadence very, very accurately, but only if it's attached to the body (tight-fitting waist pack) so as to avoid excessive bouncing. I ran once with my phone in my pocket instead of the pack and found that it overstated cadence by 10 to 15 per minute."
"My first thought is slow down. You shouldn't be breathing that hard when running. \n\nDo you have asthma symptoms at any other time? "
"Go see a doctor! Getting medical advice online isn't very safe or reliable."
"You have to do it.  It's that simple.  Well, really you have to decide you want to do it and then commit to doing it, so maybe not that simple.\n\nI do shift work (24x7 6 week rotation), so on some days I need to get up at 5am to get to work on time.  I actually get up at 3:45 to make sure I can get a run or workout in.  I didn't think I could do it, because I was always a night owl, but this year has been awesome and I really got used to that routine after a month or so that I miss it so much now that I haven't been running for 9 weeks (injury). If I can do it, so can you."
"I'm not a doctor, so I can't tell you what it is or isn't. \n\nI had issues breathing when I began running. I'm not a pro by any means, but I've found what works for me. \n\nControl your breathing. I go two steps in, two steps out. I focus on it and it helps me to control it. \n\nI noticed I was still out of breath excessively after a run or sprint, so I tried something called Cordygen VO2 Ultra. I take it 45 minutes before a run and have noticed a huge difference."
"Yeah, I have a 3 in, 2 out system, so at least I know it's regulated. However, I should look into getting a diagnosis."
"I always run at a medium pace (~7-8 minute mi), at which I can easily speak.\n\nI do play a brass instrument, and at times when I am putting a lot of air through the horn, I can feel chest asthma like issues developing as well, so there's that."
"You seriously can't find 30-60mins for a run at least 2-3 times a week?\n\nI agree that just hill sprints won't maintain your aerobic endurance.  It's fine to do them once or twice a week, but you need to do a longer run also."
"Planning on doing this for sure. I'm not sure if my family has asthma in its history, but I know that whatever I do to fix it will (predictably) be coming from a doctor's recommendation anyway."

Best I could find with some Googling is that elites have a GCT in the range of 190ms and I saw one random study that characterized 7.5mm of vertical oscillation as elevated in sub-elite women. Neither of these is even close to validated.\n\nWhat's frustrating about this is that Garmin is sitting on the data to answer these questions in glorious precision. They should know, and could report in an anonymized way, averages, distributions and relationship to efficiency (lognormal?) by age and gender....\n\nHey Garmin, send me the data?"

"Running (exercise) increases intestinal motility/activity. I'd go with less intense of a run. If you're not willing, then less fiber. All else fails, you could see a doctor about anti-diarrhea pills. I'm leaving out hydration as you noted that you're fine. \n\nBy the way, this is a common problem. I had a bout of it tonight during my run. 6 miles, had to walk the last two. "
"Hey OP,\n\nShoe fitter here. Best to go see a (well reviewed) podiatrist and check in with your GP and/or Physiotherapist. Podiatrists and the Physio will figure out what your special needs will be (i.e Orthotics, shoe lifts, specific stretches, amount of support).\n\nNot sure about your area, but in my country(Australia) our company \"The Athlete's Foot\" go to great lengths to communicate with podiatrists so they have great knowledge of Footwear and the levels of support/cushioning. It also helps if the pod had a few fitters at a nearby store from which they know will have the client's best interests in mind. Of course you're bound to come across the rare \"salespeople\" instead of a \"fitter\" every now and then, so if it's an option, ask your podiatrists/physio if they have any recommendations for places to go to get the required footwear.\n\nIf money is a problem I'd recommend at least going to a shoe store(after you've checked in with your health professionals) the first time round so you it's less of a hassle to make adjustments (For example, many of our customers get fitted or buy a recommended shoe then take their shoe back to their podiatrists for the pod to check their gait with the certain shoe).\n\nFrom then on(after getting everything right), although not ideal, you'll have a shoe that you'll be able to buy off the internet. Ultimately, it's best if you're re-fitted every couple or few years (shoes never stay exactly the same unfortunately and neither will your aches/pains and problems).\n\nSorry for the wall of text, but it won't be easy if you've had a history of problems. Just persevere and try something not as bearing such as cycling whilst you sort it all out! (Hope I don't get hanged for mentioning cycling!)\n\nOne last thing: It won't be a cheap process to see all these people and get everything you need! To avoid making if halfway through the strenuous process and running out of funds, get quotes if possible - get an idea of how much money you'll pay for a decent running shoe and how much things like orthotics will set you back"

"Hey,  I do as well. "
"365 miles in a year is pretty easily achievable goal, even for a beginner. If you run 3 times a week, you only need to run just under 2.5 miles each time. Consider setting yourself a secondary goal of 500 miles :)\n\nThe most important thing is to NOT get injured. This means resting your body when it needs it, there's a difference between tired/fatigued muscles and injured muscles.\n\nIn my first year of running I didn't have a particular goal, but I ended up running just over 1000km, my second year I set the goal of 1610km (1000 miles) and did 1800km. Last year I set a goal of 2200km and was right on schedule until I got injured in late May. [I managed to get a bit over 50% of that goal on the last run of year.](http://i.imgur.com/Vm0qvKw.png)"

"To be honest, I find it easier to run regularly when I'm working than at the weekend or when I'm on annual leave. It's almost like when it's a part of your daily schedule you just do it. Whereas at the weekend I get too much choice of when I go do I hum and haw and leave it til the last minute. \n\nMy point is: when it becomes a part of your routine you'll just *do* it without even thinking about it.\n\nAnother point would be thinking about getting yourself signed up for a race; nothing focuses my running like having a strong goal to keep me motivated"

"I found out that if I breath by my mouth only I get more thirsty. I usually inhale nose - exhale mouth ... but I was reading that for training it is good to use your nose for both exhaling and inhaling. \n\n"

"A specialty shoe store for runners purposes is an actual running store.  Not like, a foot locker or sports authority.  Depending on where you live there are some chain specialty stores, otherwise you will probably be able to find an independent running store (I happen to work at one here in the DC area).\n\nGiven the complexities of your issue, you most certainly need to start with a podiatrist.  They should be able to give you some recommendations, particularly when it comes to running with your conditions.  I would absolutely not even for a second consider buying shoes online.  Go to a podiatrist, and then take the info they give you to a running store, where you'll be able to be further fit (most people are wearing the wrong shoe size to run in), and have a chance to try on lots of different models to see what feels best for you."
"You can wiggle around as long as it doesn't bother you.  Having said that, if your last several pairs were 0 drop, you may hit the problem I'm having.  I run in Altra Torrins and wanted to try something more cushioned for longer runs, but after wearing only Altras for a couple months, everything else feels weird on my foot (anything with any drop, at least).  It sucks!  But I'll just keep going in the Altras."
"I would honestly recommend both Daniels Running Formula and Advanced Marathoning if you can-- Advanced Marathoning is full of marathon-specific information whereas Daniels Running Formula (at least the 2nd edition, I don't have the 3rd edition which just came out) is a lot more focused on high-school track/cross country and a bit light on marathon-specific information, as good as it is overall.  If you can go to a larger bookstore (or maybe a library?  The ones near me never have any good running books) and look through both of them, you might find that one of them 'clicks' with you more than the other.  I consider them both invaluable in my running library, but I definitely consult Daniels Running Formula more frequently."
"Thanks I really appreciate it! And I'll definitely go check out Daniel's Running Formula as I actually am a cross country runner, thats super helpful!!"

"the process of adaptation during training is a product of the amount of stress you're subject to. as you get stronger, the daily run you were doing before starts to get easier and therefore less stressful. in order to keep improving you'll need to train more in both the ways you listed. running more often and longer in some kind of combination will continue to yield benefits and make you stronger.\n\nif you're only running 3-4 times a week, I would suggest trying to run more often (if you want to be very careful, reduce the amount you run per day first). if your schedule doesn't permit it, then stick to the same frequency and increase your mileage. but I believe that training response is linked primarily to frequency of training. I would much rather run 10 days a week at half the mileage per day than 5 days a week. Longer runs have their purpose, but should not be a daily occurrence. "

"I know a lot of people are commenting on fuel/hydration here, and I do think that's a part of it. But I also know that when I was really ramping up my mileage in college I always felt sick after a long run, no matter what. Ten miles used to do it to me...and then after enough ten milers it stopped. So on and so forth up to my first marathon and it happened again. Then a few weeks ago I did 24 and felt fine. \n\nAll this being said, I think your body has to acclimate to higher mileage. Probably something about glycogen stores, idk the science very well. Used to be I had to bring a cereal bar to eat immediately after a ten miler or I'd crash and want to vomit for the rest of the day. Now I can churn out 10 on a normal day with no special prep or postrun care. Stick with it, it gets better. Try an apple or granola bar immediately after to get some sugar back in you. "

"Ideally you want to eat 2-3 hours before an intense run. Eating one hour before a run is worst because you'll get an insulin spike at the run start. Insulin takes sugar from your blood and moves it into fat, muscle, and liver stores, so you'll have less energy to perform.\n\nIf you don't have time to eat early enough you can eat a gel when you start the run and then stay fueled every 45 minutes.\n\nI like to eat two eggs with rice, oatmeal, or pasta."

"This was my thought as well, as a runner with asthma. The best thing I can do for myself (and for many with asthma) is ramp things up slowly. Take the first half or quarter mile at 9 min miles, the next at 8 min miles, and then \"drop gears\" to where you want to run at (adjust these pace numbers accordingly to ability). It may suck, you be slower overall, but it's also better than an asthma attack. \n\nOn race day, I puff the inhaler 20 minutes prior, and do jumping jacks and warm up for the 7-5 minutes right before I start to get my heart rate going. It eases me into it. Maybe try something like that. Cool down is equally important. Walk it out, minimum 10 minutes, or a slow jog (12 min miles). "
"Hahaha, I was diagnosed with exercise induced asthma at age 27. After a lifetime of being overweight and obese, it morbidly amused me when my doctor commented, \"why didn't we see you for this before?!\" Because one has to exercise to induce it...."
"Didn't stop running for the holidays, but my first run felt like a celebration anyway.  I ran a 10k race along a river through the fog this morning, and even if I hadn't PR'd (I did!) it would have been freaking magical."
"This. Or an [SPIBelt](http://www.spibelt.com/).\n\nOR just lace your car/remote fob/house key into your shoe. Go down a couple eyelets so the only way to lose your key is for your shoe to come unlaced."
"This is what I've been saying for a few years now. Running purists sneer at treadmills, and weight lifting purists sneer at weight machines. But used correctly, both types of machines can be useful adjuncts in your training."
"Hey! Solidarity of runners with exercise induced asthma. Jeez, it must be cold because I've seen several posts with people commenting on this. \n\nThat being said, gentle, gradual experience in my case. Working up to working harder, and finding that sort of fine line. It's tricky. And some days with seemingly the same conditions can yield different results. Which is frustrating.\n\nDitto the inhaler, the nose/mouth covering, and treadmill/inside training when it is too cold outside. Also, proper warm up and cool down (don't skimp!) have helped me. Puff off the inhaler 20 minutes prior, and then do 5-ish minutes of jumping jacks and squats and other exercises to get my heart rate up. Eases my breathing rate and heart rate up to running and race pace. \n\nGood luck! Happy running! No passing out.  "
"Like get out and run right now?  A Gu packet gel and water.\n\nIf I can plan it out, I'll eat something big with carbs 2-4 hours before running.\n\nPotatoes are really good for me.  I always eat them before a marathon.  Anything over 10 miles, I'll eat some pasta or something similar.  Below 10 miles is too short for anything significant.  Under 10 miles, I'm able to just drink water and get out to run without anything in my stomach.  Having nothing in my stomach puts me in my best running mood, but I'm a hungry hungry hippo after I finish."

"One key (either for front door or car) in the zipper pocket on the back of my running shorts. That's all I need. "
"To echo the \"Slow Down\" sentiment, if you have time pick up a copy of \"born to run.\" Particularly on a treadmill, I find myself in this \"run as hard as I can\" mindset, and even if you adapt cardiovascular enough to run \"as hard as you can\" for that mile, you are going to end up injured as you increase miles. \n\nThat \"Born to Run\" book really changed how I view running. I went from spending my summers in a regiment attack on my 5K record, to logging long easy miles off road. Not that one is better than the other for experienced runners, but in my experience newer runners should try and make running feel as easy on the body as possible. There are just too many injuries waiting to happen otherwise.  \n\nIf you can hike/walk without over doing it, try the lightest of jogs. If that works, pick it up a notch on the next run and play with the scope of paces instead of viewing it as \"that hard mile effort at the gym.\" \n\nAlso, getting a physical before making serious changes to your exercise regimen is pretty solid advice.

"Yes."
"The great thing about running, is that it doesn't really require much special gear to get started. Depending on the weather where you are, go through your closet and find some comfy shorts or pants that aren't gonna fall off when you run and a t shirt or hoodie. Right now, you don't need to worry too much about specialty running tops and bottoms. Once you get into a regular routine and see how you feel, you can tweak your running outfit. The biggest thing you want to make sure of right now is that you have a decent pair of running shoes. You definitely don't want to rock the basketball shoes on a run. \nGetting started running is a lot of trial and error. No two runners are the same. Some are early morning runners, some prefer later in the day. Some run on an empty stomach, some people can't make it out the door without breakfast first. At this stage, you're gonna have to try things out. When are YOU most likely to get out the door and go for a run? Is it early in the a.m. or are you a late sleeper and prefer afternoon? I would suggest that you pick a time of day for the first week or so and just lace up your shoes and get out there on the road. Don't set too rigid goals right now, just aim to get out there and run. You're young, so your body should recover pretty quickly, but even so, I wouldn't recommend running more than about 3 to 4 days a week right now until you see where you are. The first run will probably be the most awkward because you don't really have a frame of reference to gauge yourself by. Try finding a local track where you can mark your laps, or chart out a route near your house to try and run. When you finish your first run, keep a journal: how far you went, what your time was, how you felt. This will help you set realistic goals and tweak your training as you go. As far as diet/nutrition, everyone is different. Just remember that crappy fuel put in your body often leads to crappy performance, so obviously try to eat healthy (lean proteins like chicken, fish, etc and good carbs like bananas, rice, sweet potatoes). You shouldn't need to bang down a lot of gatoraide or flashy supplements right now.. maybe later if you get into harder, lng distance runs. Right now, just keep it simple. If you gotta eat before hand, try something light, maybe a half banana and some orange juice. Let it digest a little, then try out your run. Just keep notes on everything because this is YOUR training, these are YOUR runs, and there is no right or wrong.. only what will work for YOU."
"I've had people stop me a few times and ask for directions and find it really annoying when I'm putting in an obvious effort running.  The first two times I was out far enough that I couldn't answer their questions due to lack of familiarity and they looked completely put out, like how could I possibly not know and I must be bullshitting them.  (not knowing of course I'm like 8 miles from my house on an out and back and have no idea about some random side street a town or two over). "
"Don't stop running for the holidays, but have yet to leave the bed for a 2014 run. \n\nYou guys are up and at em already? I'll remain right where I am for a few more hours."
"Running tights."
"I was going to wait till Sunday's accomplishment thread, but I'm so proud of my boy that I needed to share. I ran with him the whole way &amp; he finished in 36 minutes. His first official race. "
"Yes a hydration pack.  Similar to this.... http://nextadventure.net/high-sierra-wave-50-hydration-pack.html?catargetid=1440609499&amp;cadevice={device}&amp;gclid=CIfu-8n-3bsCFWUV7Aodqm0Aog\n"
"Probably the strap soaked with sweat causing conductivity between the sensors. I cut about 1/2\" of material off the strap behind the HRM pod. Mine was almost useless before I did this, now it reads just fine. Be careful with this as you can end up with a strap that turns cheese grater during runs if you don't properly treat the ends.\n\nBasically the cut is between the buttons that secure the HRM pod on."
"Awesome! I wasn't able to run for about a week due to the business of the holidays, and it felt good to be back at it in freezing weather"

"Completed a 5k this morning and PR'd. 2014 is going to be a good year."
"Ran a 5 mile New Year's Day race in a decent time to kick off my resolution of running at least one mile every day of 2014!"
"Great job!"
"They found his bag with all his stuff by the way. Whoever took it obviously changed their mind and brought it back. Jamie is looking at the experience as good in the end because even though he got beat up, he got his stuff back and his charity run got a lot more exposure, which translates to more money to help sick kids."
"I didn't stop but I did do my first 10k race today. I made it in under an hour, so I am very happy! Great start to the New Year! "
"I own the original FuelBand, and for me it's kind of been hit or miss. No activity meter is perfect, but in my experience, the FuelBand is kind of just a reminder to move. It's been fairly worthless on runs, especially if you already use the app or watch (I use the watch), but it is nice to look down and see that I have to get x more fuel to reach my goal.\n\nIf you're already using Nike software, what you might want to look into instead is the [SportWatch](http://store.nike.com/us/en_us/pd/sportwatch-gps/pid-431910/pgid-1475307). I own this too, and as a fairly novice runner, it provides all the info I need. No it isn't as advanced or accurate as a Garmin watch, but it works fine for me. The only complaint I have is that it can take awhile to sync up with the GPS. \n\nThe benefit to the watch is that you don't have to ditch the Nike+ software, and you can begin to stop taking music or a phone with you, since the GPS is more accurate on the watch (in my experience at least)."
"My first morning session of the year felt pretty average, but it rained in my afternoon session, so that was refreshing. "
"5KM this afternoon in minus 15 + windchill. So, it was bloody cold. \nI got strange looks from all the passing cars. Felt very grateful for my new face/neck warmer I got for Xmas.\n\nBut my first post Xmas run was 12KM. Which was a new personal best. So that felt great.\n\nI'm really looking forward to what I can accomplish this year!"
"I run with my German Shepherd.\nPeople frequently try to stop me to pet my dog/ask me questions/chat.\n\nI just ignore people I don't know and give a breathless wave/hi to people I do know. \n\nThe other day at a stop light I had some obese older gentleman ask me where I got my running tights. So that was uncomfortable. "
"Good luck with that :)"
