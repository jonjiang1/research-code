"I second the silicone scar sheets. I had a biopsy in February and used the sheets up until about a month ago. The results were remarkable. \n\nI also had an accident over thanksgiving (violent stomach bug hit the whole family &amp;amp; i passed out and hit some unforgiving furniture) that resulted in a head-wound that required 17 stitches right along my eyebrow. I'm not sure how I'm going to manage the scar sheets on my face in public. (looks funny with a mostly covered eyebrow) My reg doc recommended vitamin E oil which I thought I remembered seeing mentioned here as being no bueno, so i'll have to look it up. Even if I have to limit the silicone scar sheet use to time-not-in-public, I'll do it because this scar is shaping up to be nasty. My only problem is I don't want it pulling out anymore eyebrow hairs than have already been lost. As it stands about 2/3 of my eyebrow is basically defined by the red scar, not the hairs that used to occupy the space. Really don't want to have the Vanilla Ice 90's eyebrow look for the rest of my life :("

"I don't, but their website says that it can make your skin purge and that after a week or two it will go away and be done. My skin is just super sensitive so it broke me out pretty bad and I didn't want to keep using it."
"I used to do the exact same thing! I have since stopped all of that (except for tretinoin as a spot treatment for the occasional big guy) and have a much less irritating routine thanks to this subreddit!\n\nI have scarring on my cheeks and only get active acne on my chin, for some reason. \n\nAm:\nCleanse with diluted Dr. Bronner's soap\nPat dry\nSt. Ives AHA pads \nWait 2 minutes until dry\nMoisturizer with Yes to Tomatoes lotion \n\nPm:\nCleanse again\nUse Vaseline to remove excess makeup \nMoisturize \n\nAnd OCM with Coconut oil 1-2 times a week.

"Most sunscreens, from what I've used are unisex. Anyway, I find that companies have a hard time covering up the sunscreen smell so all sunscreens smell pretty much the same anyway.\n\nNeutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry Touch might be an option if you have skin that doesn't get oily. On it's own it has a slight sheen (and tbh I think all sunscreens have a sheen) which is perfect on it's own (gives you a hydrated look) but on oily skin like mine it's just too much."
"You could always use a [silicone gel](http://www.kelocote.com/default.asp) when you're in public (you can get this at Target, Walgreens, etc), and the sheet when you're at home (I love [Scar Away](http://www.myscaraway.com/)). The gel alone doesn't work quite as well as the sheet, but it definitely couldn't hurt! I find that as long as I wear the sheet at home/during the night, it still works quite well. "
"OCM, wipe it off, and then Stridex? Is that working for you? Thanks!"
"I have used Vitamin A oil caps in the past, just locally though, over these kind of pimples. If you have access to tretinoin (prescription grade retinoic acid) even better. I apply it just to the area of the pimple (maybe a little around it) and eventually my skin peels off in layers (over some days, maybe 5-7) of 2Xdaily application. The head of the pimple is then either revealed or the pimple goes away altogether. That is my own solution though, but i have had success each time. "
"lol, my dermatologist also said that I needed a 10-session treatment (dunno if it was laser or electric) and that sunblock is all you need. Sounded sketchy as hell."
"According to some previous threads/posts, pitted scarring can't be helped by over-the-counter products, so you may want to talk to your doctor about options. Some people said that chemical peels helped, and they can be done at home, but YMMV."

"Wow, definitely get a second opinion like, inyourlibrary suggests. My acne was not very severe a year (i'd say moderate), and I got the opinion of two doctors. The first one was in an asian dermatologist center that wanted me to also do weekly extractions and prescribed me very generic versions of acne medicine. The weekly extractions to me, seemed very intense as I didn't believe my acne was that bad. I went to another dermatologist recommended by a doctor friend, and she had me on oral antibiotics, and topical antibiotics. No extractions necessary. She would extract 1 or 2 during a follow up, but nothing as excessive as weekly extractions. She cleared my acne up in about 3 months. Be wary of some dermatologists. Some can be ultra-perfectionists when it comes to getting your face clear, and prescribe/advise treatments that end up costing you a lot of money. "

"I used to live near a tourist spot that sold them. 4/$12 there &amp; I know they have an online shop. "

"Clinique is currently out of my price range atm. Going through a bit of a financial stump at the moment :( I'll keep it in mind, however. "
"For my skin, it doesn't dry me out. However, it does have alcohol in it to make it dry faster rather than have it sit on your skin. If your skin dries out easily, I would be wary of it. Also, it's not a cream, it has a liquid like texture to it. "
"I use this one from Boscia. Works great under makeup and doesn't leave a white cast. http://m.sephora.com/daily-defense-sunscreen-broad-spectrum-spf-50-pa-P378334?skuId=1494525"

"Ohhhh, yeah. I forgot about the gel!! Thank you so much for reminding me. And yes, Scar Away is what I used for my biopsy scar. I just cut the sheets in half or into 4 smaller squares. Got that tip originally from someone treating their implant scars, lol.\n\nWow, you seriously just made my day. I've been staring at, and sulking over, this scar for weeks (and continuously since I read this post).

"Asian female here.\n\nUsed to have pretty bad acne in my teens all the way up till a couple years ago. I tried a lot of products, but nothing stuck (it'd go away, then come back).\n\nI switched my diet to mainly paleo (no grains, low sugars), stopped eating any kind of fast food, and stopped drinking sodas, and quit processed foods. I also started working out 30 min a day at least 4 days a week.\n\nMy skin cleared up really well - all I have left are shallow scars now.\n\nEvery so often I slip during parties and such and have grains/sugars/sodas/processed foods, and the acne comes right back.\n\nTry doing a paleo diet for a month and see how that works out for yoy (/r/paleo)."
"It is popular in some Asian products as well. I use it in one of my products and noticed the eye cream I am planning on trying has it as well. Which made me research it recently and find out that I shouldn't be using it with my acidic products. I wondered how well known that info is. Am I the only one who didn't know I shouldn't be using them together?"
"What do you think is the difference between 'chemicals like water' compared to sulfates or the ingredients in Dove?\n\nSilicones are inert molecules, used in contact lenses and stents.\n\nSulfates are a salt of sulfuric acid. Epsom salt is a sulfate. Gypsum is also a sulfate. It's naturally occuring and is used to make tofu, added to baking dough as a calcium supplement, and used in plasters, drywall, and for taking dental imprints."
"I do hope you're using sunscreen every day, since you're using your AHA in the morning.  AHAs make your skin more sensitive to sun damage!  It's also nice to do AHA at night because you can let it sit for a bit longer, since you don't have to go anywhere."
"yup!\n"
"COCONUT OIL"
"I've seen that warning here and on the silk naturals website (since they sell a niacinamide product as well) but don't think I would've known otherwise. Interestingly, I haven't had a reaction from mixing them yet. I forgot that my foundation contains salicylic acid and was applying it soon after applying the cerave w/ niacinamide. No problems w/ flushing that I'm aware of. Strange!"
"So you think that the ingrediants in Dove is okay? Since, I disagree. The foaming ingredient gave me awful itches all over my legs. I had to stop using the products."
"Sunscreen doesn't prevent any of the benefits you listed, with particular regard to mood, etc. I don't think anyone denies those benefits. Still need to wear sunscreen to safely enjoy them though."
"As far as I know, that kind of product may sound luxurious but I don't think gold or diamond have any benefits to the skin. Actually, gold is [harmful](http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/gold) to the skin. You would probably be better off saving your money and purchasing a more beneficial skincare product."
"Yes, it was reformulated recently. If you do a board search you should find some more info on that. "
"Most of the mood comes from the wavelength hitting your eye and vitamin D. The former needs no direct skin contact and the latter can be supplemented."
"I'm kinda curious as to why you say \"especially in Asian skin.\"  What is it about 'Asian skin' specifically that would produce that kind of reaction?  "
"Yeah need to talk to your doc about alternative meds. Once you get off the Wellbutrin the seizures will likely go away. Good luck."
"Lululemon is a bunch of bullshit. Take it from the fitness queen here - I have spent more money than I care to admit on their clothing over the years; their company practices in so many instances are awful and their clothing is no better than other brands. I've seen that sunscreen quote and it perfectly encapsulates their 'no substance' approach to branding themselves. I wouldn't let statements about sunscreen annoy in this example as fundamentally any LLL acolyte = chump anyway."
"Any kind of surfactant has the potential to be irritating. That doesn't have anything to do with it being a 'chemical' - it has to do with its ability to dissolve your skin's oils, which is what makes it useful as a soap ingredient. It makes dirt and oils water soluble so they can be rinsed away. This property is what makes something a soap.\n\nThe surfactant used in the dove products is a fatty acid from coconut oil. It's not even synthetic. Maybe you're allergic to coconut. \n\nThat said, the top cause of irritation from cosmetic and soap products is botanicals and essential oils. Synthetic ingredients are overall much safer as they are formulated with the intent of being tolerated by human skin.\n"
"Sunscreen doesn't even inhibit your ability to absorb/synthesize vitamin D. It has no effect on it whatsoever. "
"Yup, those ingredients offer no benefit to the skin and definitely no anti-aging benefits."
"Wearing sunscreen can in no way affect your Vitamin D levels.\n"
"I usually wear makeup with SPF 15, is that enough? And switching AHA to the evening sounds like a great plan, thank you. :)"
"My dr recommended the use of mineral oil in the shower and afterwards as a treatment for eczema. It is endorsed by the National Eczema Foundation and lots of research. It is very effective. Just be sure ot dab off excess instead of wiping.\n\nSkip the tea tree oil, it is an irritant and can INDUCE skin allergies and eczema in people wehre there was none before.\n"
"I know the precleanse wouldn't be causing oils or too much irritation because it isn't very harsh, I just find that the whole routine I am on is not helping at all. It's so frustrating for me because i have all these products basically brand new and they are very pricy. It worked well for me for the first while but now my skin is just in the tank. "
"Patch test first. I ended up with an abscess and staph infection from coconut oil usage. It is highly comedogenic is a decent amount of the population.\n"
"To add on to what /u/BadMannerBluePill said, the St. Ives pads also have citrus extracts in them, which you may already know are dangerous to apply prior to sun exposure.\n\nI was told here to use them only at night."
"Okay so I definitely agree with everything you are saying and I love me some sunscreen-\nBut two things: fortified vitamins aren't absorbed as well by the body, and vitamin D taken into your body isn't as useful without the sun!\n\nHowever, as far as I know...sunscreen doesn't block the sun, just prevents the UV from getting through? "
"Once you restore your skin's barrier, the staph won't be an issue. Everyone has staph on their skin, the problem is that it can deeper into the tissue in people with eczema. Mineral oil + Cerave in the tub should really help. Cerave is one of the most effective OTC methods ot help restore a compromised epidermal barrier.\n"
"I've seen the Biore Aqua Watery Essence recommended for a light sunscreen. It's a gel.\n\nI'd imagine you could get it in Singapore if you intend to buy sunscreen there. Otherwise it's on Amazon and you could get it shipped to you."
"Totally not a dumb question!! I just put the sunscreen right on top of all my makeup (but not on my eyelids). It does sort of dilute whatever makeup I'm wearing so it's not as full of coverage as it used to be, but it's not awful."
"Removed for violating rule #3.\n"
"Either way, sunscreen doesn't block out 100% of UVRs. Thus my, \"unless you're crazy about it,\" stipulation."

"I will definitely give a dairy free diet another go. I was hoping that wouldn't be the case because cheese is so delicious :("
"If you don't know what it is, then you're asking for a diagnosis and it is against the rules.

"I'm pretty sure at least SPF 30 is what's recommended, and unless you're using 1/4 tsp of makeup, you're not getting even the SPF 15 advertised.  \n\nI wear a BB cream with SPF 40-something daily, and I still wear SPF 55 sunscreen under it.  I'm sure that sounds totally excessive, but I know I'm not using near enough makeup to get the advertised SPF, and my mom's side of the family is super cancer-prone so I'd rather not chance it, lol.\n\nHope that helps a bit!"
"The Neutrogena Oil-Free Moisture range is lacklustre tbh. I've used the Sensitive skin one and it was pretty blah. That wash you're using it absolutely terrible and completely drying.\n\nHave you tried the CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser? Or if you didn't like it try out either the Neutrogena Extra Gentle Cleanser (using this one myself, I quite like it) or the Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Cleanser Hydrating (haven't tried it, but it looks good too).\n\nMoisturiser recs are in the Beginner's Routin in the sidebar, check them out.\n\nUnfortunately for you, a separate sunscreen is of more benefit than a moisturiser/sunscreen combo because most people do *not* apply the correct amount (1/4 teaspoon). \n\nSince you mentioned sensitive skin I would recommend you try out a mineral based sunscreen. Elta MD Intesne I think is recommended a lot, though it's pricey. Banana Boat Natural Reflect is another recommendation I see often for mineral sunscreen.\n\nA BHA product (check the Beginner's Routine in the sidebar for recs) will help with the sebaceous filaments and your occasional breakouts. I do not recommend Stridex for you since it contains menthol, a skin irritant. If you can handle fragrance the Neutrogena rec is a nice choice, otherwise the Paula's Choice is fragrance and irritant free (though ymmv)."

"What's the issue here? I don't see an issue. It sounds like you haven't seen any new acne from missing two days, plus starting BC didn't affect your acne. You're fine."
"Well, if it works for you, it works for you :)\n\nBut I prefer to play it safe (there's steam, and it's hard to avoid some water in the ferrule with smaller brushes) and use cool/room temperature water and disinfecting wash. Some people don't know that hot water isn't usually recommended for cleansing for those reasons, so I just wanted to make that clear. \n\nFor my synthetic ones I like to use a silicone brush pad too - I got mine at an Asian discount store and you just swirl the brush over it. It has little raised bumps that help work out the makeup, especially if you use a brush shampoo or oil mix. "
"[deleted]"
"As in for your hands? That actually sounds like a pretty good idea (as long as hand sanitizer doesn't cause bad reactions on the skin on your hands), especially if you can't wash your hands before reapplying sunscreen, so you're not rubbing bacteria from your hands onto your face when reapplying."
"Just wanted to vent about the bar soap cleanser topic. I'm a medical aesthetician and work at a medi-spa inside of a dermatology office, owned by the doctor. I disagree with the regimens the dermatologist gives to my clients constantly, but I have to be very careful about how I give my knowledge on what they should be using instead as to not discredit the doctor (as most of them are her patients that she's seen first). You have to realize that dermatologists almost always prescribe and recommend products from the medical/drugstore companies that they are partnered with...regardless of the different skin types and needs of patients that they come across. I swear my dermatologists only ever recommends Cetephil, CereVe, or Dove to very single patient that asks what cleanser would be best for them because those are the only cleanser companies she is partnered with. These drugstore products are packed with cheap irritants, sulfates, dyes, and fragrances. It bothers me to no end that she never recommends a good professional skin care product that is free of all these things...for instance, the products that we carry at our office!  Bar soap is usually too alkaline for the face, stripping your acid mantle (the protective barrier of the skin that is made up of sebum), which is going to disrupt your pH balance. This is going to cause excess dryness, irritation, and sensitivity to the face. To work it's best, our skin should be slightly acidic at a pH about 5.5. You will also need some acidity to inhibit bacterial growth on the skin, so this is especially important for those who are acne-prone."
"I'm on 113 mg and no seizures yet. I really feel for OP. What a horrifying experience!"
"I lotion my skin after I shower and wipe away the dry skin."
"The ratio of flaxseed to jojba is up to you, but the TTO should only be a maximum of 5% of the mixture.\n\nI would suggest less than 5% for you since you have dry skin. TTO can worsen dryness and flakiness. So just a few drops per 100ml of oil."
"Agreed! I love shopping there when I have sales/EB/coupons on my side. I've bought huge drugstore makeup hauls for around $25 that way.\n\nWhen you're buying the CVS generic skincare though make sure the ingredients list is the same - meaning no filler ingredients that might affect how it sits on your skin. Sometimes the generics have more comedogenic/irritating ingredients than the name brand. "
"God, I can't name a store I've been to that has anything but the worst light possible in their dressing rooms.  It's a conspiracy or something."
"Thanks so much!  \nI'll definitely try out the CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser and a mineral based sunscreen. I've used Stridex before and it irritated the crap out of my skin, so I'll try one of the other two you mentioned."
"First, sunscreen everyday, even when it's cloudy out, even in the winter. Reapply every 2 hours if you're outside. This helps prevent them from getting darker and will maintain the effects from lightening products.\n\nWhich brings us to the \"lightening products\": AHA and Vitamin C. Just do a search for those on this sub (and check out the sidebar post on chemical exfoliation) and you'll find plenty of information :)"
"Thanks for the detailed reply.  I'm gun-shy on sunscreen because it's been so bad for my skin, even the Shade physical sunscreen my dermatologist recommended and SPF in my powder foundations.  If I got in the sun, my skin would itch, burn, and breakout.  But I know it is necessary for long-term skin health, and I am very fair, so I gotta do it.  It looks like Paula's choice gets rave reviews on here so I might start there- grab some AHA and sunscreen.    \n\nI've been prescribed retinoids but no one told me not to get my eyebrows waxed, so after that fun skin-losing experience, I stopped using it.  I might use the retinoids for a little while but I've been enjoy my skin feeling *good*, not red and irritated.  It's so wonderful!  \n\nI will keep an eye on those ratios.  I'm also buying some argon oil based on reviews I've seen here.  I'll probably add some to my oil or use it for my moisturizer and reduce my castor oil soon.  "

"Thank you so much! This was incredibly helpful. I was just worried the other soaps and things would get on the patch I was testing and interfere! Much appreciated :)"
"I think the visit is only covered. Additional treatment is to be paid for. I paid $1000 for the entire 10-session treatment (not sure if worth it)."
"That's understandable. That's usually stopping permanently though, and pops up after a several day to a few weeks. But your acne wasn't even affected by starting BC in the first place so you have nothing to worry about :)"
"I'd give the girls at /r/makeupaddiction a shout out.  I know that if you're worried about bacteria you could spritz them with rubbing alcohol.  Also, you should be drying them pointing down, not on their side, to maintain shape."
"Well when that happens to me, it a ingrown hair. It was one of the reason I hated shaking everyday. "
"And another question; with a product like glycerin, which is supposed to work like a cream not an exfoliator, it's obviously a bad thing if its burning right?"
"I agree, purging simply doesn't happen. Mineral oil usually breaks me out so I'd be taking that out and sticking to natural oils like castor/olive/almond etc for an oil cleanse. "
"Just a heads up, it could be PIE and not PIH."
"Oh! Oh! This was my exact problem before I started birth control and my skin went from oily to dry. Everywhere else was usually fine but my forehead was so oily you could fry an egg on it.\n\nThis may seem to not make sense at first, but the oil control products may be worsening the situation because they dry your skin out more (a lot of them tend to contain alcohol) and strip your skin of all its natural oils, and then your skin over-produces oil to compensate. That's called dehydrated skin.\n\nYou have a few options:\n\nPerhaps stop with the mattifiers and try switching to a gentler cleanser that doesn't leave your skin feeling \"squeaky clean\".\n\nYou could also look into OCM. That's helped a lot of people with oily skin.\n\nAlso, try just blotting with a napkin throughout the day, or dusting your forehead with a powder (I like rice powder) on a big fluffy brush to control the oil.\n\nP.S. What moisturizer do you use? Make sure it doesn't have SD alcohol/alcohol denat./ethanol in it."

"The first time i had a seizure, the hospital told me to go back to 150. When i saw my psychiatrist, she said it wasn't from welbutrin, and made me go back up to 300 two weeks ago. Then i had the 2nd seizure a week ago, so the hospital told me just to stay off of it. My psychiatrist left town, so i have to find a new one to put me on something else. "
"I saw that!  (I've been trying to do a lot of reading of the side posts.)  I *think* it is PIH because it has always faded in 3-6 months in the past.  But we shall see.  "
"I've tried the 3-Step and I'm a type 3 oily-combination as well. I'd recommend replacing the Clinique brand toner with an alcohol-free witch hazel toner like [this one](http://www.amazon.com/Thayers-Witch-Hazel-Original-Alcohol/dp/B000S823S6/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1388541498&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=witch+hazel) from Amazon. That should help you with your oil while not drying out the rest of your skin.\nYou can also use the oil cleansing method instead of the soap. It may seem counter-intuitive, but my oily-combination skin has never been less oily since I started replacing soap/cleanser with the OCM. You can read more about that in the sidebar."
"I totally understand. In that case, give cerave hydrating cleanser a try. Also, do you use micro fiber face cloths? I find those take everything off my face really well. Im sure you could find those cheap online. I think a combo of cerave and a micro fiber cloth would do the trick! "
"Could be anything: sweat, friction from clothes, your laundry detergent, your body wash/soap, etc.\n\nFind out if any of the above possible causes is the culprit, and eliminate it. \n\nAs for a routine, treat it the same way you'd treat your face: gentle cleanser, chemical exfoliation (BHA or AHA), and moisturize. "
"It's a humectant moisturizer (holds moisture), but it needs water to bind to, so pure glycerin on your face just sucks moisture out of your face.\n\nTry 30% glycerin mixed with 70% water. If that still burns, then stop using it and maybe try an oil between passes instead. It's definitely not supposed to burn. I have heard of other people also having a glycerin sensitivity on this sub though."
"[EltaMD sunscreens](http://eltamd.com/sun-care/) are all fragrance free. Any except UV Physical (which is tinted) would be fine. UV Clear is the most popular. UV Facial is good if you have dry skin.\n\nYou can buy samples for a few dollars on Ebay if you want to try a few different ones."

"No offense, but your psychiatrist sounds like a shit head."
"thanks. you made me feel a lot better"
"Yes, assuming all the mineral oil was cleansed off your face first."
"My favorite sunscreen!! It keeps my face slightly matte for an entire day and just dries nicely. I wish it was sold in even slightly bigger bottles."
"According to that post I have PIE (just the temporary pink marks that last a week or two unless it was a bad spot, then a few months) but I treat them as pih and they fade just the same, just more quickly I'd guess."
"Oh, I thought PIE rarely fades.  I need to re-read it.  My post-pimple red spot fades in a couple months.  "
"Can you post the other ingredients or product name?  Gold/diamonds are just marketing, they won't help your skin, but since it's a high end product the other ingredients are probably good stuff. Maybe we can find something similar without gold and diamonds?"
"I don't wear sunscreen because it's expensive and I'm poor. But I'm rarely in the sun anyway. \n\nIt's winter so only my eyes and fingers are exposed when I go out. \n\nI do wear sunscreen in summer though. "
"I imagine that diamonds would be bad news too, since St Ives is too abrasive, a diamond must be too abrasive too!"
"how do i get rid of it?"
"Check out the sidebar and beginners routine for great recommendations :) we put those there for a reason.\n\nDefinitely look into chemical exfoliation, such as BHA and AHA (as opposed to physical exfoliation/scrubs), and moisturize. Oil isn't necessarily bad for acne, only some types of oils clog pores (e.g. coconut oil). Be sure to patch test everything and inccorprate new products one at a time, slowly, because everyone's skin is different and reacts differently to different ingredients."
"Interesting point on the bc! I currently have the Mirena (highly recommend it, btw), but it's due to be changed, maybe that's part of it. \n\nThe aveeno doesn't leave me feeling squeaky, but the clean and clear does. Aveeno is daily, c&amp;c 2x a week, and apricot scrub once a week. \n\nThe moisturizer is aveeno as well. Just checked and ingredients aren't listed on the bottle. I'll try a new one. \n\nThanks so much for the tips! "
"Yikes. I went to a dermatologist that was very highly rated on various doctor review sites and he was considered one of the best in my area. He, too, advised me to use regular hand soap (antibacterial Dial). He also prescribed an oral antibiotic (clindamycin) in a high dose, but it was never a long term option because 1) it causes blackening at the tooth's base if used for years on end (sounds healthy /s) and 2) it actually made me foggy headed and made me hallucinate once. WTF. He also prescribed a very drying topical treatment (not sure of the name. it's the one you need to refridgerate) and advised using ZERO moisturizer, because \"acne skin is always oily skin.\" Obviously it dried the shit out of my skin and made it worse. \n\nAnyway, my point is, dermatologists sometimes have a blanket plan that seems to work for oily teenagers but not for adults. I'm 25 and his one size fits all plan destroyed my skin. I actually didn't find relief until I discovered this subreddit and started experimenting with the beginners skincare routine. "
"Oohh ditch the apricot scrub! That's one of the big no-no's here (that and baking soda and lemon juice). It uses ground walnut shells as the scrubbing agent, which is sharp and uneven and creates microtears and can damage your skin. Look into chemical exfoliation with BHAs or AHAs! \n\nYeah, BC definitely changed my skin quite a bit. (If you're curious at all, I'm on the NuvaRing). Has Mirena affected your skin at all?"
"Thank you for the info!\nI'm fairly light skinned and I live in sunny CA, and skin cancer is definitely not something I want. I have a Neutrogena sun screen (I think it is at least 40) that I can start putting under makeup and I am going to switch up my AHA routine too to be extra cautious. \n"
"I think it depends on the person. Everyone reacts differently to everything. Quit for a few days and see how your skin reacts. I know alcohol can cause various flare-ups for many people but have no effects on others. I say give it a try and eventually quit smoking! It's not healthy :)!"
"My mom is convinced that my argan oil is breaking me out. No, it's stress. I know my face so STAHP, MAWM, STAHP IT!"
"My boyfriend and I both use it and and like it - I put it on when my skin is still damp and it absorbs well and doesn't break me out. it is a little too light for the winter weather, though, so if your skin is really dry I wouldn't recommend it."
"We have a beginners routine and FAQ in the sidebar that you'll want to check out. It sounds like you definitely need a gentler routine! Preventing the dryness and flakiness in the first place is much easier than trying to fix it once the damage is done. You may also want to check out the link on \"dehydrated skin\". That sounds like it may be the underlying issue causing your combination skin. I got a lot less oily by pumping moisture into my skin"
"I am having issues with my current moisturizer not being enough, so overall it seems like the hemp moisturizer may not be the best for my skin"
"aquaphor!!! Much like Frank's Red Hot, I put that shit on everything!"
"I used to think lululemon clothes were pretty cute, but after working for an eating disorder clinic for the past year, so many of our patients wear their stretch pants that it's really hard for me to not associate the brand with eating disorders and the thin ideal. Bleck. "
"Bite Beauty has this new product called the Agave Lip Mask. It's fantastic! It's really thick and sticks onto lips, and it doesn't slide around all over your face like Aquaphor can. It also has a nice taste and looks like a really cute shiny gloss to wear in the day."
"only because there's a statistically higher rate of lactose intolerance in asians vs caucasians."
"It probably is purging. I went on epiduo during the summer, and for a while I had little skin colored bumps on my forehead. They were really annoying, but they went away after a month or two. I suggest you just keep at it. I'm really happy with my 'new' skin, it gave me so much confidence. Good luck!"
"Try cutting back your exfoliation to every other day. Stridex can get pretty drying for me and I only used it every other night."
"It could be a cyst. Get one of those microwavable gel packs or whatever, and apply heat to the area (not too hot, but really warm) for as long as you can. If you could sit with it there all day, do that. The heat will dilate your blood vessels and allow the fluid built up in the cyst to essentially \"drain.\" Also, putting preparation H on it can also potentially reduce the inflammation."
"Or any oil in general! The NOW brand by Amazon seems like a good option."
"I have such chapped lips every time the weather gets cold (so all fall and winter) that I look like I have rede lipstick on, so as soon as I get out of the shower I load up on burts bees and/or specific moisturizing non-tinted chapstick. I also apply heavily before sleeping and throughout the day. This give me normal soft lips."
"Congrats! You're almost there."
"I found using a microfiber cloth removed all of the oil. If you are touching your face to see if it's gone before washing your hands, you're feeling leftover oil on your hands from cleansing. I used to think I wasn't removing the oil until I realized I still had oil on my hands. "
"I have dehydrated skin. The hemp moisturizer sinks in quickly but is not moisturizing enough. Now I just stick to my beloved argan oil for moisturizing."
"Your freckles will fade if you block out the sun every day with sunscreen. My freckles fade in the winter because of this, but I actually really like them. Go freckles! (Or not, in your case it would be more like go *away* freckles...)"
"Do you know anything about acne near the jawline? (jawline below my ears).\n"
"As a pale, freckly Texan: tomorrow I'm buying sunscreen, y'all scare me! I guess late is better than never, eh?"
"I like to use coconut oil to remove my makeup, especially my waterproof mascara. I stopped using other products and now this is all I use. I warm it up first though. Extra bonus = I think it makes my eyelashes longer! \nHere is the one I use: http://traderjoes.com/fearless-flyer/article.asp?article_id=973"

"I've decided to return the items I bought tomorrow. "
"In my Halloween store, we had the old frosted light fixtures from the American eagle dressing rooms that were there before us. I had to warn women that a lot of the costumes were actually very transparent in bright light. Even the modest ones are kinda sheer if you're wearing them during the day or to an office. I might have gotten more than a $10 sales bonus if I didn't, but I couldn't (in good conscience) not say something."
"That and bad advice in magazines. Hence why I used harsh cleansers, baking soda, and lemon juice at various points in my quest for decent skin. Gaaahhhh"

"See, people often say \"1/4 tsp of makeup\" or \"1/4 tsp of sunscreen\" like it's some huge amount, but that's how much I've always used. Look at a measuring spoon--1/4 tsp is not some huge volume. I don't think using 1/4 tsp of foundation is absurd. Do other people have faces that can be readily covered with pea size amount or something? Am I the weird one here?"

"My dermatologist suggested that I get extractions and, at least for me, it has really helped my acne.  I've tried most OTC treatments and several different prescription treatments (antibiotics and topical treatments), but it wasn't until the extractions that my skin really started to clear up.  \nThat being said, a lot of the other stuff he suggested is pretty sketchy, so a second opinion certainly would not hurt."

"I get incredibly irritated whenever I see \"sunscreen is evil\" claims. I think it was last summer, when my cousin (who is a natural platinum blonde with very fair skin) posted a link on her Facebook page to an article she found somewhere and added a comment along the lines that she's been \"living her life the right way, yay\". Meaning she doesn't wear sunscreen, ever. I wrote a rather hasty and rather angry comment to the article - which the website also published (to my surprise, as they moderate all their comments and what I had to say was the exact opposite of what they had written).\n\nThe article itself included all the cool anti-sunscreen arguments: butbutbut VITAMIN D!; all chemicals cause cancer! and people who use sunscreen will stay in the sun for longer periods of time, which along with the TOXIC CHEMICALS in sunscreen will cause so much more damage, than just hanging around in the midday sun would cause without sunscreen.\n\nI'm not even sure why this upsets me so much, but I proceeded to write this long, but still somewhat superficial comment about the naturalistic fallacy, the different ingredients in sunscreen and what UV-rays actually do. It's all in Estonian, so I'm not sure whether anyone would be interested in the link. I can try and find it, if necessary.\n\nNow I'm upset again, goddammit. :D"
"I get that on my feet, like my heels and the balls of my feet. Luckily, I wear shoes and slippers so it doesn't show until summer. However, I've heard that putting gobs of Vaseline on your feet and then putting on socks will help with dry skin.\n\nPerhaps you could try that with Ace bandages, at least for your knees?"

"Best way to get that honey going is a vitamin c serum. Now- ***l-ascorbic acid*** is what you will be using and GURL, that's the same stuff in fruit. It is the same stuff pressed into pill shape and taken as a vitamin. What happens is LAA is extracted into its purest form, thus becoming a powder with which you use to make a topical product. It is *only* LAA. You can mix it once a week with fresh water to ensure 1- a fully active product and 2- you know exactly what's in it.\n\n[here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1lfm47/diy_vitamin_c_serum_a_really_full_explanation/) is /u/SaraSays post on why you should be making yourself a vitamin c serum. What I suggest you do is simply mix it with water and use it as a spray. That way it's only water and LAA. Honey, that is as pure and natural as you can get short of rubbin' an orange on your face (which you shouldn't do since it has photoreactive chemicals in it which will cause horrific burns should you go in the sun with it on).

"This sounds a little weird but I promise it helps. Not just for skin but also for joint health.  Make stock/broth from bones. Old school but serious health and beauty booster.  Use bones with a lot of connective tissue, like joints.  If youre into cooking, a whole chicken carcass is perfect.  Lots of recipes online, just be sure to cook it for a loonngg time really low heat. It should gel up when put in the fridge. My freezer looks like a crime scene from saving scraps.  Ohhh if your really brave use chicken feet and skins too.  And plain gelatine, knorr or other brand, can be added to drinks etc. If all the bones and skin stuff is too weird.  \n"

"I personally only use about a pea size amount of makeup or a tiny bit extra if I'm splotchy; I don't need a lot of coverage, it spreads pretty easily and I have a tiny face.  For me 1/4 tsp of BB cream would be a huge amount and would look cakey.  So yeah, I'd say it does depend on your makeup and the surface area of your face.  Bottom line is, that's the recommended amount."

"Same here, 450mg Wellbutrin daily for many moons (as a supplemental to an SNRI). I was recently in the market for a new psychiatrist and one guy took a look at my dose and said \"If I give you any more Wellbutrin you'll probably have a seizure.\"  - Yea, didn't stay with him. My new doc said it's not dangerously high (increased my SNRI dosage that day too). Of course everyone is different; if OP's seizures are definitely from the Wellbutrin I can't imagine why the doc would stick with it."

Former CEO Chip Wilson, an avid snowboarder, **said he came up with \"Lululemon\" because he delighted in the idea that trying to pronounce the name -- with its three syllables beginning with \"l'\" -- would pose a special challenge for the Japanese, whom he enjoyed making fun of.** From that less-than-enlightened starting point Wilson went on to create a huge controversy in 2005 when he announced that the firm would rely on child labor and \"sweat shops\" in China, after three competitors in his native Vancouver went belly up due to rising labor costs.\"\n\nEdit: Emphasis added."

"I'm going to hijack this thread to ask a stupid question. Is sunscreen really mandatory to be wearing/using on a daily basis? I never wear it, and it never even occurred to me that it's common to have in your routine. I also don't go outside often. "
"\nIn order to provide meaningful advice it would be useful to have some more information:\n1. How has your skin gotten worse in this new environment? You mentioned that the place you are now is drier. Does your skin feel dried out now or has it become more prone to break outs? Plenty of people on the sub find it helpful to use a humidifier in the winter to combat dryness.\n2. What does the rest of your routine currently look like? Are you only doing the ocm, or do you have additional products like a moisturizer or a toner? If you don't currently have a moisturizer then that could be something to try (and if you want to stay all natural there are definitely oils that you could look into).\n\nNow down to the virtues of natural products, natural does not inherently imply better or safer when it comes to skincare (or life in general). The are plenty of naturally occurring compound that can really damage the skin (see the sidebar link on lemon juice). I'd suggest reading over the section on the Naturalistic Fallacy on the sticked/[META] post on the front page. That being said if you like the OCM I don't see a reason why you couldn't make it work, there are some good resources in the sidebar for the OCM as well."
"Well, apparently we don't need sunscreen, just their products!\n\nhttp://lululemon.com/community/blog/the-truth-about-sunscreen/"

"is there any specific sunscreen you recommend? all i wear is my bb cream which has spf in it but that probably isn't enough. i'm just worried it will react badly with my face since all i've ever used is like neutrogena spf 100 on my body and that was kinda strong. \ni don't even know what any of those things are except for vitamin c! i should browse here more! i use a vitamin c serum (skII) and i think they've gotten lighter but they're still there. chemical peels sound...scary. \nedit- i just read a little bit on AHAs- so if I just started using a lactic acid chemical exfoliant (1x a week because it's kinda strong) should this help my freckles?\ni love skincare but i'm so completely clueless ahhhhh"
"Whatever you're trying to say is lost on me, hun."
"Cerave products were made to restore a compromised skin barrier, such as in eczema. There's tons of research on how effective it is and it's recommended by the national eczema association. It's NOT chocked full of irritating ingredients, don't let it scare you that it's a drugstore product."
"You know, what I don't understand is that there are plenty of safe and natural sunscreens with less chemicals. Literally wearing nothing isn't safe, obviously. It's probably more harmful (saying probably because I don't have stats) to wear nothing. There are other options than copper tone, people! I would know, I have skin reactions to literally everything and have spent a good deal trying to find a good natural-as-it-gets sunscreen!"
"CeraVe has none of these irritants that you claim and there's a huge body of research to support its formulation and efficacy. Drugstore products can be just as effective if not more so than many \"professional\" lines, which often contain botanicals, the top cause of irritation from product usage. Also, many of them are formulated primarily the exact same ingredients as drugstore products. Don't be fooled by marketing and high price tags."
"That is absolutely not worth it,"
"Depends on sun exposure but really should at least add a SPF 15 to a moisturizer and use more/apply often if out in the sun. Sun exposure causes skin cancer obviously, but can also cause issues with skin healing, hyper pigmentation and other things I am not as well versed in."

"Right now, yep. It's super dry and my face needs it. I use a small amount of argan oil in targeted areas and then moisturize everything."
"Bit late for that :P"
"I've used cetearyl alcohol without any issues before.\n\nHowever I've noticed some evidence that ceteareth 20 is actually harmful when applied onto damaged skin.

"I know people who just eat a tsp of unflavored gelatin every day. You can dissolve it in water and drink it before is starts gelling. It supposedly is great for strengthening nails, but I don't know about helping the face."
"Sounds like you might be using too much and it's not absorbing.\n\nHonestly unless you're uncomfortable with the feeling you don't need to change anything. But it might be worth scaling back how much you use if you want to avoid the waxy feeling."
"It'll help improve the skin texture though since you're no longer rubbing against it.\n\nYou could probably treat it like keratosis pilaris wherein you use a gentle physical exfoliant followed by an AHA lotion. And just keep the area moisturised. "

I have combo skin, but holy-moly did it make me shiny. Had to walk around like a greaseball for a couple of days until I figured out how to modify my make-up routine and still had to add powder around 3-4pm when my make-up wore off. Also had an acne flare-up after about 2 weeks of consisent use, although I'm not quite sure if it was the product or some kind of weird hormone fluctation. Overall, it did work great, but the texture and cast weren't the best for me and I didn't repurchase after giving the sample a run. \n\nTo answer your main question, I'm now using the Shiseido Hada Senka 50+ that I got off a retailer on amazon (I live in Ukraine and I can feel your product pain:)) It got here pretty fast actually (2 weeks, took the same for my Silk naturals order) and I love it! It's comestically elegant, goes on smoothly and it evens out my skin as a lovely bonus even though it's clear. It also hasn't made my skin break out so far even though it does have a lot of silicones to which I'm not really sensitive. The texture is fabulous - dries nicely and works well under my make-up. Overall, I don't dread using sunscreen like I used to. "

"On the other hand, I get super painful pimples in my nose. I know yours aren't painful, but maybe what I do can help yours too? \n\nI put neosporin on a q tip and just rub it directly onto the bump/pimple. I use a q tip to make sure there is no bacteria from my hands/fingernails going into my nose. Mine go away in about a day or two. Don't pop it! (it sounds like you can't anyway), or you may get an infection. "

"I also agree with 'if she's asking - she's ready'. I remember myself around 10-12 and that was when I started getting interested in skincare. We never really had those kind of talks with my mother and I just started dipping into her products a bit (bad me, I know). I especially gravitated towards that darn St. Ives scrub... I think it would be nice for her to have something of her own that she could use and I think your educational talks could be awesome and interesting for her. I definitely wish I could have learned about all of this still in school, I would have been waaaay more into chemistry than I was and, most importantly, been spared all of those years of middle and high school acne grief because that really was pretty painful."

Just wanted to make a remark on the MAC Studio Fix Fluid - I've been lurking in [r/makeupaddiction](http://www.reddit.com/r/makeupaddiction) and I've noticed that a lot of people have had breakouts with it, such a shame, I've heard that the texture is lovely."

"I like to just use mineral oil for OCM and then coconut oil to moisturise because I don't think spending money on the oil that is going to leave your face in 45 seconds is worth it. \n\nYou could also use one oil to do both, you can do your OCM then wipe off the oil and put on some more and leave it on."
"Yeah! It's like magic! It just all comes off in little rolls like an eraser. Though it's kind of nasty to see SO MUCH dead skin on the shower floor after haha."
"Jawline breakouts are usually hormonal. They aren't like normal acne where you can extract them,  but rather are more sensitive to the touch and have a larger surface area. I get them every 3 months and I try my best not to pick at them and make sure they are well moisturized and it goes away within 3-4 days. In another word I don't think it's related to the oil. "
"Ok, female here - I am 100% in favor of your taking charge of your health and deciding to work out.  Personally, I am not a weightlifter (I focus on cardio/skiing/flexibility/strength training) and my skin GLOWS after a good workout.  I can actually tell when I haven't worked out in a few days because my skin doesn't look as \"nice\".\n\nI am not sure of your financial situation, but if there is a way you can swing by your doc or your derm to have a discussion about your concerns, it would help significantly.  Whether it be to switch up your skincare routine or say there won't be a problem, it will put your mind at ease.  Heck, maybe even see a dietitian!  \n\nWhatever route you choose, best of luck and happy new year!"

"BIODERMA. It's French so you have to buy it online (Amazon or eBay). It's seriously the best cleanser/makeup remover. It removes everything and doesn't irritate the skin at all.  In fact it feels like water. \n\nBeing a wild skincare addict before, I have now learned what works and most cleansers are horrible. I say if you do a good job on removing your makeup, all you need is very mild cleanser (I recommend milk based ones). "
"Thanks.  I have PCOS and totally unpredictable periods, so it's hard to know what my crazy hormones are doing (under a doctor's care!).  I'll be sure to keep it moisturized and keep my hands off.  You're totally right, these ones are more sensitive to the touch than my normal breakouts."
"That doesn't magically give me enough money for preventative measures though. "
"You are drying out your skin which breeds more acne. I would stop using the Stridex altogether because I don't think it's good for your skin (especially the OK parts of your skin). \n\nI like the less is more approach to skincare. I would say make sure to cleanse your face twice at night to remove all makeup and then use a very gentle cleanser to clean off the skin. Then apply whatever moisturizer/serum you prefer and the use spite treatment on your acne rather than smear a pad with highly drying ingredients all over your face. In the morning,  use the gentle cleanser again and apply spf-based moisturizer. "
"I occasionally have that problem. For me, it's caused by me constantly holding my chin in my hand at work. When I'm concentrating my chin rests between my thumb and pointer and middle fingers. I have to consciously stop myself from always doing it. Your issue might be hormonal though. Sorry you're having problems, breakouts really suck :("
"Used up my EltaMD UV Daily and decided to try EltaMD UV Shield instead. I was using the UV Daily in lieu of moisturizer, but still ended up with a bit of shine on my face (and I have dry skin). I now use the UV Shield over a tiny dab of CeraVe and my skin is hydrated, soft and matte. LOVE!"
"Glycerin is a [humectant moisturizer](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/15ya22/classes_of_moisturizers_explained/).  It's good for dry skin and the product is formulated with water so it's not going to be problematic."
"Working out is probably the single best thing you can do for your skin health. Just make sure you don't touch your face while working out (as the equipment is generally very dirty) and wash the sweat off your face with water as soon as you're done. If you notice that you're getting new spots the morning after working out then I would bring a tablespoon or two of oil (oil cleansing method, it has helped me a lot) to the gym and use that to additionally clean some of the sweat/dirt from your face.\n\nOther than that, one thing that helped me was to use a moisturizer right after showering after a workout, personally I use this: http://www.red23.co.uk/Tiana-Rose-Fresh-Coconut-TLC-Organic-Moisturiser-100ml_p_2056.html, and honestly it was a game changer for me.\n\nBut even if you do break out from working out, it will only be in the short term, in the long term working out will only promote skin beauty/health."
"YASSS! I love Vitamin C serum, but I'm too lazy to make my own. I've been using the Mad Hippie Vitamin C Serum and love it, but I really want to try the [Oz Naturals](http://smile.amazon.com/Best-Vitamin-Serum-Contains-Hyaluronic/dp/B00DPE9EQO) next since it gets awesome reviews online. \n\nSide note, I call everyone honey and gurl, too. But, then again, I'm a Southerner :D"
"That's because it's just a bunch of different fats in a jar.  It's not all going to soak into your skin, so some will always be leftover on your face and feel slippery with water.  This is normal.  If it bothers you cut way back on how much you're using."
"I have been getting laser hair removal treatments on my face for about two years. I started using the recommended  Alpha Hydrox 10% AHA about a week and a half ago and am planning to have a laser in the next week or so. I know the gel makes you photosensitive - does this include laser? Should I stop the gel and resume after the laser?\n\nThanks in advance! :) "
"My goal with my regimen for the past couple months has been to get to the point that I no longer wear foundation. I was using primer, a liquid foundation, a liquid concealer, a setting powder, a cream blush, and a setting spray every day. Is it realistic to believe that my skin will be healthier and maybe even look better once I give up all of these products? Because I felt like I was creating a problem by trying to mask a problem with all of my makeup. Thoughts? "

"Yes, spironolactone is an androgen blocker and prevents the testosterone in your body from signalling the sebaceous receptors to overproduce sebum (that's why hormonal acne exists).  You just have to talk to your gyno or derm about the chin acne and tell them you want to look into a BC alternative."
"Wait a minute-- working out doesn't produce more testosterone. Steroids and shit WILL break you out but just lifting weights isn't going to change your body's hormone composition. Women have little testosterone which is why we don't get gigantic muscles like men do (unless we take steroids). Your fears are unfounded, have no worries. \n\nEdit: if you guys think I'm wrong please tell me why. I've been lifting for a log time and never ever heard of lifting weights creating MORE testosterone naturally. My understanding is that women have to take steroids or HGH in order to produce more of the  hormone (testosterone) necessary for huge muscle growth. So please, if I'm incorrect explain it instead of jut downvotong. That is not helping anyone learn. "

"I finally finished my tub of Nivea Creme. It was fine in the winter time but far too heavy for the warmer weather. I'm back to Nivea Soft now and it's definitely my favourite moisturiser ever.\n\nI also finally finished a bottle of Soap &amp; Glory body wash that I've had for about six months, so I bought a bottle of Dr Bronner's Magic Soap to replace it. I'm not sure about it yet. It smells nice but it's not as moisturising. Maybe I just need to start using body lotion more often.\n\nStill powering through the stash of sunscreens I bought in Hong Kong. I'm starting to tire of the milky texture so I'm thinking of trying a local supermarket-brand sunscreen that gets good reviews online."
"&gt;Are the chemicals in normal cleansers really as bad as the natural sites make them out to be?\n\nNo, not at all.  Everything is chemicals.  \n\nSee [this post's blurb](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1i0tr1/meta_hello_new_subscribers_please_read_this/) on the naturalistic fallacy.  \n\nHowever, just adding in a cleanser isn't going to do much for acne.  Cleansers don't fight acne bacteria they just keep the skin barrier healthy and clean.  It sounds like you need an acne spot treatment that contains active ingredients known to help with acne (i.e., BP, SA)."
"This comment was removed due to rule 3.  Please read the meta post that's stickied on the front page to familiarize yourself with our rules on dietary/medical advice.  \n\nBut also, the vinegar thing is a bad idea.

While it may dry up the oil, all this is doing is disturbing the skin's [barrier function](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1dwck9/teach_it_tuesday_the_facial_epidermis_structure/).

My skin, especially my hands, stays so soft all day.\n\nI also bought Bioderma Hydrabio Legère, so time will tell on that. Maybe it will replace the Avène antirougeurs, but it was expensive. 19EUR for 40 mL. Should last me a bit."

"Is it okay to use mineral oil followed by a cleanser in both the AM and the PM? Say, to dislodge SFs in the morning and to remove makeup at night?"
"No touching, no picking, keep your hands off of your face!  You only need to keep your face moisturized and protected (SPF).  When you're at home keep it covered with a layer of vaseline or something like EltaMD Intense moisturizer.  [Do not use Vit E](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1b8wg5/vitamin_e_and_scar_reduction_some_literature/) unless you know your skin is okay with it, but there's really no need for it."

"Tell your gyno or your derm about this.  There's zero need to deal with hormonal breakouts!  Topical treatments and the standard OTC cleansers will not help with these types of breakouts.  You have to treat them from the systemic/hormonal level.  "
"So long as none of the ingredients in any of those makeup products are breaking you out (and just to clarify, makeup doesn't inherently break out skin, perhaps just certain ingredients for certain people) and you wash it off properly at the end of the day, it shouldn't really decrease your skin's health.\n\nBut since you'll require less coverage, you'll look more natural if that's your goal. If you're more into the fun hobby artistic side of makeup, well, I would rather paint on a clean canvas than a dirty one."
"Only if your makeup products were part of the problem.  Cosmetic coverage is often recommended for people suffering from acne because 1) it's rarely part of the problem, 2) it makes people feel good about themselves, and 3) it increases the rates at which patients comply with treatment regimens.  So keep using makeup if you want, but it may be beneficial to do some sort of patch testing with your products to see if one of them is comedogenic for you."
"SLS is a surfactant which means it helps the product rinse out of your hair.  There's no SLS left in your hair after you shower.  If you think it's because of your hair touching your face it's more likely due to a conditioner or other hair product that leaves behind product on your hair."

The key is to just leave it alone and to not irritate you skin further which could cause tough scar tissue to form. The turmeric is great as it helps calm my skin and is said to stop bacteria from growing/spreading according to the Google Gods."

I know not everyone gets them but then again I might be missing something. \n\nSo! Is there a certain, extra-effective way to massage the oil into your face?

"I started taking 50mg of Zinc a day and that has helped my hormonal acne tremendously.

I've heard of others taking a higher dosage but 50 worked for me so that's where I've stayed. [Here](http://www.zinc.org/info/zinc_essential_for_human_health) is a pretty good site that lists all the benefits. "
"No, I'm really really new to this subreddit, and was reading about it last night. I'm planning on picking up some mineral oil today. In case that doesn't do the trick for me, what chemical exfoliant should I look for? Ideally I need to stay in drugstore range."
"Very good point.  I hadn't thought about that :)  Another reason to keep swimming. "

"I've been on spironolactone for over 3 years and I've never had any side effects aside from having to pee a lot.  I took 100 mg for a long time and it completely cleared up my acne.  I used to get cystic acne around my chin and jaw hardcore.  It took a long time for it to take affect but it has been my miracle solution.  Of course I still got some acne, but that was before I found this subreddit and learned how to properly take care of my skin.  For a lot of people 25mg or 50mg can be pretty effective but my skin was stubborn.  Now that my skin is pretty much clear I take 50mg and I get maybe one or 2 pimples a month (usually from picking at my face :( ).  I'm not saying you won't get side effects as I have read about other people getting headaches or messed up periods, but as far as acne medication goes, I feel like it's safer than birth control and much safer than accutane, I just have to make sure I stay hydrated.  That's just my experience anyways, I hope you find something that works for you!"

"Maximum strength stridex (red box). It's really cheap "
"Intense lifting does increase testosterone naturally, but the change is not going to be very significant in a healthy individual. Certainly it is not going to be significant enough to cause or exacerbate acne.\n\nWhat is connected to acne is, as you say, vitamin T taken in super physiological amounts, i.e. steroids. But even then the testosterone is not likely the *cause* of acne, it is just one of many possible catalysts. Ultimately acne has to do with internal inflammation in the body and sebum oxidation in the skin; sure, testosterone will increase sebum levels, but all the sebum in the world isn't going to lead to cystic acne if there is no inflammation otherwise."

I got frustrated and did some research and learned it has something to do with estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone levels during your cycle. Everything I read suggested that you can try an over the counter vitamin called Vitex (aka chastetree berry) to help regulate your progesterone/estrogen levels. I couldn't find it on its own, but did find it in a female hormonal balance vitamin from a brand called femMED. let me just say, I have only had one cystic breakout since starting and it was significantly smaller than before I started. It also has the added bonus of helping with PMS. I'll try to find some articles about it and edit later. It has worked wonders for me and since it's over the counter, I don't have to deal with prescriptions or seeing a doctor/dermatologist who will either prescribe me something that won't work or that is really harsh. \n\nEDIT - [here's the original article I found](http://www.thelovevitamin.com/9662/q-about-vitex-agnus-castus-for-acne/#.UsRbY6jnb0w) There's a ton of good info in the article.

I love this stuff! I really appreciate that they included a lighter neutral tan color so that I can mix and blend some of the darker ones to better complement my skin tone. \n\n* ***Urban Decay* Eyeshadow Primer Potion in Greed** - I got this because it was $10 at Nordstrom Rack, and /u/dirtygirlcamo is a terrible influence and tells me when these things go on sale, and then drives me to the store so I can buy it in some sort of ritual, best friend sacrifice to the makeup gods.  But honestly, this stuff is pretty legit, though quite shimmery. It doubles as a nice highlighter.\n\n* ***Benefit* Gimme Brow!** - I really like this stuff; it fills in the gaps quite nicely!

"My eyes water a lot when I'm asleep, so I always wake up to dry, flaky eyelids. While there's no way to stop my eyelids from leaking all night, is there anything I can do for the dry skin around my eyes? I've been using an oil-free moisturizer by Neutrogena every morning and throughout the day if needed (I can't wear eye makeup or it will get worse), but it only helps for a couple of hours then my skin dries out again. Suggestions would be super appreciated."
"Oil then cleanser. The cleanser will get the remaining oil off"
"Mineral sunscreen reflects the sun,  unlike chemical sunscreen which where the chemicals \"break down\" when they absorb UV rays.  At least this is how I understand it. Maybe the instructions or the bottle are made to make the consumer use more of the product, like lather-rinse-repeat; or else the suncreen also contains chemical sunscreen ingredients?\n\nHowever you probably need to reapply mineral sunscreen if you swim, or if you sweat a lot, since most formulas are not waterproof. Or if you touch your face."

"&gt; primer, a liquid foundation, a liquid concealer, a setting powder, a cream blush, and a setting spray\n\nI know some of these words.\n\nThis is anecdotal, but I've noticed that girls who wear loads of makeup every day always have significantly paler faces than their bodies, so when they don't wear makeup they look sick.\n\nYou will still tan slightly, even with sunscreen.\n\nYou don't have to wear zero makeup, but using less products daily might benefit you.

"You don't have to use expensive oils.

"I started zinc as well after reading that it can help with acne and that people whom are vegetarians and/or eat a lot of beans can be deficient of it. My acne seemed to have been improving the first couple of weeks, but now I'm still getting bad acne. I still haven't finished the 100 tablets yet. My skin got drier but I don't know if it's the weather (here in SoCal the weather has be in the high 60s, 70s, and 80s though) or zinc. People claim zinc can reduce oiliness, which is another reason I decided to take it.  \n\nIf I take zinc tablets on an empty stomach I will have bad stomach aches. Also, I have noticed I get headaches when taking zinc regardless. Most of the times they are minor. My sex drive has sharply increased. I was looking through some forums and men were talking about how zinc made them horny.  \n\nTl;dr: Zinc reduces oiliness and increases your sex drive. Headaches may accompany when taking zinc tablets. \n"

"What is a thermal remover? It was advertised as laser treatment on the website I visited."

"Do you want to prevent aging and/or skin cancer? 90% of signs of aging are caused by UVA rays. You should be wearing as high an SPF as possible, BROAD SPECTRUM (PPD of at least 8 /PA+++) with stable ingredients every day, even if you stay inside all day. If your curtains are open, if you pop out to the corner shop for 5 minutes, all those small amounts of sun exposure add up and will have a cumulative effect in later life. You must must must use it if you are using AHAs/retinoids as they increase your skin's photosensitivity."

"The SA in cleansers doesn't do its job. SA needs to be at a low pH and sit on the skin in order to work, so in a cleanser it's just an irritant. You'd be better off with a gentle cleanser and a separate SA product. How many times a day do you wash your face? Decreasing to once a day will also help cut down on irritation"
"It depends on what causes your acne. If your acne is triggered by hormones, then topical treatments will do very little for you.\n\nBP is usually used for spot treatments I think, at least that's what I gather from the [sidebar](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/spot_treatments).\n\nIf your acne originates from clogged pores, then a BHA will help you since it works by penetrating the pores. BHAs also have anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. \n\nIn any case, if you're going to use a new product remember to patch test! That way you can determine if the product works for your skin before applying it everywhere and have it potentially wrecking havoc on your face."

"At what % does chemical exfoliation become a peel? Or do I have it wrong?"
"No, not everyone would be albino. Everyone who wears sunscreen properly will be at their lightest natural skintone. Not everyone is naturally super pale. Using sunscreen consistently and properly only blocks most UVA and UVB rays. It does not block the beneficial effects of sunlight."

"Because no one on here is posting their negative experience with spiro, I'll post mine to give some balance. I took it for my hormonal chin acne for about 3 months before I felt forced to give it up because I couldn't stand the side effects I experienced. First off, I started getting my period every two weeks, and it was longer than usual. According to my doctor, that is a pretty normal side effect. I might have been able to control that with birth control, but 1) taking Spiro was my way of avoiding taking BC in the first place and 2) who wants to take pills for their pills? \n\nI was so exhausted all the time. I took off work and school occasionally because I couldn't get out of bed and would sleep for 12 hours at least. When I was awake, I was still a haze of exhaustion. Not to mention my PMS symptoms suddenly doubled in frequency alongside my now bi-monthly period. This made my acne worse beccause it always flared up around that time. \n\nI really did not want to stop taking Spiro because after trying everything but acutane, I felt it was my last real option. These side effects may effect only a small number of women taking the drug and I don't want to scare anyone away from what may be their miracle, acne medicine. This is just my personal experience. "

"* I can't provide any moisturizer recs without knowing more specifically what you need/can't use.

"i couldn't find the tub at the target or walmart near me, so i had to go to an actual drugstore (walgreens) to get it, and... i actually don't like it too much for my face. it has a fairly low amount of petrolatum in it, but still enough to give it that \"barrier\" effect you get with vaseline and shit. while the reduced moisture loss is good for dry skin, i think it prevents my skin from expelling everything it needs to and i get pimples whenever i use it on my face. i use it on my body after showers now, works fine.\n\n\nthe difference between the 12oz pump lotion and the 3oz pm lotion is that the pm lotion is specifically formulated for your face so it has \"better\" ingredients. the 12oz is more basic, it's made for both face and body. i like both of them, but i find the 12oz more moisturizing. the 3oz has a gel-like consistency so if your skin is dry you should probably not spend money on it.\n\n\n\nall 3 are solid products though, it just depends on your skin and preferences. if one doesn't work on your face, it's not a waste - you can use it on your body."

White like I just bought it.\n\nI feel like this particular product might not  be an every day sort of thing.  I'm interested in this moisturizer."

"Oh, right. D'ho! \n\nI googled that, and here it's a heart medication or high blood pressure. Don't think it's the same thing as in your country, must be under a different name."

"I used some clay mask thing from Proactive but I dont remember the cost.  It was fantastic.  Then I bought the same from amazon, but I have a feeling it was some kind of knockoff because it wasn't the same texture/consistency.  That one was like $6.  Not sure if I just got a bad one or if those are typically knockoffs with the same labeling.  I don't like proactive cleansing products, but their mask and green tea moisturizer was pretty darn good.  Would like to get that mask again.  Anyone know where to get for cheap?"
"I sometimes get eczema on my eyelids as well. Mine can be severe. I think it happens when my face is too dry, like in the winter or from acne fighting face washes. It may also be from irritation from eye makeup. I go to the dermatologist for acne reasons and I told her about the dryness on my eyes. She gave a sample of a medium strength steroid cream and that helped a lot. It treats the eczema and the dryness doesn't reoccur for a long time. This might work for you, but if your dryness is more mild, a stronger cream like aquaphor or cerave might be helpful. "

"I'll share mine as well since I didn't necessarily have a bad experience with it but I wouldn't call it a good experience either.  I started with 50mg a day and by the end I was taking 100mg a day.  I've always had normal blood pressure and still do.  I stopped taking it because it didn't do much for my acne at all.  I had just come off The Pill and was looking for a way to calm my crazy hormonal breakouts.  I remember it made me more tired than usual and also made my periods more irregular.  I also remember having to pee a lot more which is a side effect.  \n\nWhen I switched derms, my new dr. suggested that I stop taking it because I just came off the pill and needed time for my hormones to adjust so taking a hormone suppressing medication would be counter productive.  Since it wasn't doing anything for my acne anyway, I agreed.  So as with everything, your experience may be different.  Some people see great results, I just wasn't one of them."

"Been to 7 dermatologists here. After the first, I felt shocked by the poor treatment. After the fourth, I became suspicious. By six and seven, I ignored their advice. BTW, three of the derms I saw did help, just not for very long.\n\n I am following SCA's advice, and FINALLY healing.\n\nTrust your instincts. It's *your* skin, and it will tell you what works and what doesn't. That process may take a while to figure out, and it will change with age and environment. Gentle is better than harsh."

"Yeah, this pretty much. I feel like I empty my bladder more completely when I'm drinking tons of water, too."
"Nope same thing!  It was originally designed to be a BP med (when taken at high doses).  But when they started giving the stuff to old men they quickly figured out that it blocks androgen receptors!  So all of these old men had low BP but were also experiencing side effects like ED and secondary feminization!  So we *now* know that men can't take this medication.  "
"450 is the max. I was also told that I can't mix my CR with the XR because it will dump too much drug into the system and cause a seizure. All drugs have side effects but it's a safe drug when used properly. Still as with every drug,  there will be some people who can't tolerate it at all. "

"I have emptied 4 things this month and am repurchasing them all. That's pretty impressive, right? I buy more things since SCA but I've been wildly more successful with my purchases, too! \n\n**Empties**\n\n**Elta MD UV Clear 46** My boyfriend and I both use this. I have dehydrated, acne prone skin and he has dry skin. It breaks neither of us out and I can wear this beautifully under makeup with no breakouts and no flash back. It also feels good when I put it on my skin. Any heat-y pricklies or weeping acne spots just release an \"ahhhhh\" when I put this on.\n\n**Silk Naturals Super Defense Serum** Three months later and my pigmentation has definitely improved. \n\n**CearVe Moisturizing Cream** Ya'll have heard enough about this.\n\n**MUAC Fade Peel** I've been using this for three months once a week and my skin has never looked better. More even complexion. Positive affect on acne. PIH, gone. Pores, less noticeable. Holy fuck.\n\n**Purchases**\n\n**CearVe Moisturizing Lotion** My boyfriend and I are using this as a body lotion and it has a pump which is a huge plus. We both love it and let me tell you, we live in Detroit. (Nunu voice): \"It's cold out there.\" If CearVe starts making hair products I'll pretty much sell them my soul."
"I patch tested Silk Naturals BHA toner on my wrist and behind my ear, and it felt and looked fine, so I applied a few drops all over my face the other day and waited for ten minutes until applying moisturiser as usual. My face felt a little itchy after that; there was no sign of redness, and I wasn't sure if it was just a placebo worry or not, so I left it on until the next morning. Everything looked fine, but now I'm not sure if I had an actual reaction or a mentally induced one. Maybe I should try the toner on the KP on my arms instead? "
"I'm currently battling a breakout from a bad reaction to Garnier's BB cream, so I guess my New Years skin resolution would be to remember to patch test more often."
"Do you two also apply sunscreen on your whole bodies under your clothes? I have heard that intense sunlight can penetrate most clothes but applying it over your whole body everyday seems a bit costly.\n\n\nDo you two also apply it even before going to work?

You're deal looks damn good for $10 for $4oz.  I'd like to get it but I don't have prime.  I see other sellers on the same screen but not amzon fullfilled.  I'm just hesitant because the 3.5oz mask on the proactive website is $28 and it just seems like a huge price gap which leads me to believe that it may not be legit on amazon.   But I may just have to give it another shot as its such a good product."
"I also kind of feel like $16 is a bit pricey for a face mask, but if it works for you that's fantastic!  Here are some of my favorite \"affordable\" face masks: \n\n* **TURMERIC** - This is my darling, I love it so much, and it's definitely well-liked on this sub too. I mix turmeric with full-fat greek yogurt (the lactic acid is good for your skin, and it helps prevent staining), and sometimes I put in some colloidal oatmeal and honey. The turmeric comes in a large amount, colloidal oatmeal is just oatmeal ground into a powder, so the highest \"expense\" is your yogurt (which I keep around to eat, yum!)\n\n* **Aztec Healing Clay** - So the [jar on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Aztec-Secret-Indian-Healing-Cleansing/dp/B0014P8L9W/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1388610227&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=aztec+healing+clay) is like $7, but it's a pound and lasts forever. I combine mine with Bragg's apple cider vinegar, which is like $4-5. Considering how many uses I get out of this, I'd say it's affordable.\n\n* **Rice Flour** - I don't do this too often, sometimes as a follow-up mask to the turmeric mask. I mix some rice flour with honey and sometimes milk or tea (I drink so much tea, there's always something I can brew up) - never black tea though, usually herbal, green, or white.\n\n* **Avocado** - ... Don't know if this counts, but sometimes a girl just wants to smush avocado all over her face. Don't judge. Sometimes I mix in a bit of honey.\n\nI've come a long way since I first asked /r/skincareaddiction if I could eat a used face mask. :(  If I want a little extra \"oomph\" I'll add maybe a couple of drops of tea tree oil or neem oil. "
"I want to try the fade peel, it sounds amazing "
"The stuff that's Amazon fulfilled should be legit. If it's not, you'll have no trouble getting a full refund"
"Purchased:\n\n-Neem oil. I'm not sure about how well it works on my acne, but it has been amazing for making my irritated cartilage ear piercing feel better. That thing had been bothering me for months and a little neem cured it in a night!\n\n-Elta MD UV physical. I hate it. It makes my face feel oily and it's made me break out. Also the tint seems to do absolutely nothing for me. I'm very disappointed. \n\nEmpty:\n\n-Banana Boat Natural Reflect sunscreen. I bought the EltaMD to replace this, but I'm going to buy more. I've tried a lot of physical sunscreens now and this is by far the best (and one of the cheapest!)"
"If you are referring to an enzyme exfoliating type cleanser, all of the ingredients meant for exfoliating will go down the drain when you wash the cleanser off. I know this because I asked that question before :P I'm not sure about any cleaners with physical exfoliants, because they're not super popular on this subreddit for most skin types. I hope this kinda sorta answers something lol"
"There are plenty of drugstore sunscreens that are very inexpensive and still good.\n\nIf you're not sensitive to chemical sunscreens, then you have your pick of a lot of good products.\n\nIf you want a physical sunscreen, Banana Boat Natural Reflect is great and doesn't leave a white cast as long as you rub it in."
"Shipping is expensive. \n\nI wear hats and scarves and don't go outside much. "
"Maybe you're getting downvoted because you assumed OP is female, when OP is actually male, so he does have more testosterone than women. \n\nI know nothing about lifting or hormones, so I can't comment on whether working out will give him more testosterone or break him out."
"Ha. Ok. A little while ago, I read an article claiming that the key to have a younger looking skin was to avoid coffee and wear sunscreen on your face daily. Avoid coffee because it dehydrates your skin and wear sunscreen because it apparently helps to make wrinkles disappear.\n\nI guess skin care is a lot of work :)\n\nhmmm the real question is how many are willing to do this? Probably not a lot of people since almost everybody I know (even myself sometimes) can't function without their morning coffee cup.\n\nI also wonder. Does it cause you to breakout? I remember that when I used it daily, it made me break out. Well actually, I'm not 100% sure it was related to that but it could have been."
"1. Can someone give me advice on facial peel timing? Is once a week (no matter the peel) a general rule? ( I recently purchased mandelic acid and TCA 12%)\n\n2. I got a small sample from MUAC of \"phytocell serum\" which has been pretty awesome. What is a phytocell and what is it doing to my skin?\n\nThank you! "
"I do a shortened version of mine.  Generally skip exfoliation and leaving oils on overnight.  Because I wear makeup, it's absolutely necessary for me to remove it.  So just a quick cleanse and moisturize, then back in bed.\n\nIf you don't wear makeup then you can probably skip one night.  Maybe just splash your face with water if you feel a bit grimy/sweaty.  "
"Question about double cleansing with OCM: do you use a washcloth to remove the oil prior to using the cleanser?  Or just do the oil massage, rinse, and then use cleanser?"
"If the post hadn't specifically said \"cheap\" and was just a rave about a face mask this wouldn't be an issue. Whether you consider $16 dollars a little or a lot to spend on something is subjective, but in the context of skincare, where there is a wide range of effective products under the $15 dollar mark, a $16 dollar product is pretty objectively out of the cheap range even if you can easily afford it. A lot of people would click this link with the expectation of finding a product in the low-end price range and would end up finding this unhelpful."
"I'm not sure if this would help, but have you though about putting a *thin* layer of vaseline around your eyelids before bed?\n\nThis would make an actual, physical barrier to stop the salty fluid from drying out your skin.\n\nI know some people are skeptical of using vaseline on their face, but I've always found that a thin layer is gone by the time I wake up, and there's no visible greasiness."
"I do not have a history of low blood pressure, and I was taking the introductory 50mg dose. "
"They were not being checked, and as I live in Arizona the heat definitely causes extra dehydration. I did try to keep my fluids high to counter this problem, however. I regularly drink a lot of water anyway. "
"OP didn't mention his or her gender in the post and this sub does tend to have more female subscribers in my experience. If OP is male then I apologize for assuming otherwise but damn, how often is it assumed that female posters are male? Is it really a downvote-worthy offense?\n\nIf OP is female, my post is accurate. I can't comment on how working out affects hormone levels in men but I believe that without taking supplements he has however much testosterone he has. So in that are it would still be accurate. Working out alone won't raise your hormone levels any significant amount. "
"true.  Just gotta wait until I get another $25 worth of product to spend.  thx"
"\nThey probably recommend reapplying it every two hours mainly because your body sweats throughout the day and creates imperfections in the layer that you have applied. Experts also say that you should reapply every two hours."
"You can have a (physical) exfoliating cleanser, but you should only use it 1-2x a week"
"Looks like the stridex is working pretty well for you on your nose/forehead areas and less so on your cheeks. I find the same thing happens to me. My suspicion is that it's because SA is oil soluble and your cheeks have fewer oil glands, so it just isn't as effective there. I've been using the St Ive's pads (lactic acid) in addition to SA and wasn't really sure if it was working, but after going without it for about a week my cheeks are breaking out pretty badly so I think it does make a difference.\n\nEdit: I think this could also be why your skin looks better to you in the mirror than in the pictures, because a lot of these pictures are from the side. In the straight on ones, your complexion does look improved and that's the angle you would most likely be viewing yourself at."
"I'd try it for another night or two and see if it still itches"
"Wipe off the oil, then cleanse. I found it difficult for my cleanser to remove all the oil otherwise"

"I've started the beginner routine and almost immediately I got breakouts. They're cystic (I think) which is weird, because I rarely get acne like that. I don't know if it's purging, from what I've read it's usually little white bumps. \n\nAM: Splash with water and CeraVe in the tub.\n\nPM: Take off makeup with baby oil (only about two or three nights a week, I don't wear makeup that often), CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser, Stridex, CeraVe in the tub. \n\nThis is what my face looks like http://i.imgur.com/DPV8MiM.jpg. I've only been breaking out on the left side. I've been doing the full routine for close to a week now.

"I was told by my dermatologist that they work best on contrast: dark black hair against pale white skin. And it also works better on thick, coarse hair. My legs are very pale and I had long, dark, coarse black hair so the laser worked best there. However certain areas like the face and privates have a different type of hair so the laser does not work as well. The hair is noticeably thinner and softer, but it's still there.\n\n\nI know that it does not work on white or blonde hair. Do you know why the lasers don't work on red hair?"
"Sorry for the late reply, but did you mean that you do OCM, and then moisturise with hemp oil? Or you use the hemp oil for OCM? If the latter, what do you moisturise with?\n\nI have eczema too and my face is making me sad."

"Eat better and exercise. I know there is no conclusive link between diet and acne, and I'm actually inclined to say diet doesn't directly affect it for most people. I do, however, know that stress does horrible things to my skin, and I'm starting to feel like my body just can't take the abuse anymore. Even if it has no tangible effect on my skin, being healthy feels good, and feeling good means not stressing so much about every little thing."

"I settled down before I had a skincare routine, but my general perception is (and was when dating) to not change things of importance to me. Pack your routine if it's important.\n\nOne night stand? Why should your skin look like crap for the next week (or however long it takes to recover from a lapse in routine) if you're not seeing the guy again?\n\nLooking for long term? Then he's probably attracted to you for many reasons, and your self-care is probably among them. You shouldn't get flack for taking care of yourself, and if you do then that's something to consider about his character.\n\nAnd if your skin is resilient and can take a night off, then do whatever you want to do/ take the bare minimum."

"About how long after I stop using a product that clogged me up can I expect my skin to clear? I use a nightly BHA and a semi-nightly AHA, if that matters."

"My insurance company wouldn't cover adapalene gel so I got a low dose, 0.025% trentinoin gel thinking that the concentration would be low enough to avoid side effects and the gel formulation would be similar. WRONG! The trent is an alcohol based gel and I'm still peeling like a python and experiencing increased skin sensitivity. So. ....fuck you Regence. "
"Do you wear makeup? Do you apply it along your jawline? Make sure when you wash your face to also wash there. I don't know if that's your problem, but jawline acne pretty much vanished for me when I realized that I need to wash more than just the center of my face. I take my cleanser down about halfway my neck and it's rarely a problem anymore. "

"My favorite lip balm is the palmers cocoa butter stick (not the one specifically for lips), but if I don't have that I use vaseline. I also make sure to always apply it after washing my face or showering. Just like the rest of your skin, your lips will lose a lot of moisture after getting wet. "
"how often do you shower? do you soap up each time when you shower? i read somewhere that soap may strip away the natural oil your body produces."
"boots no 7 seem like they're actually a really great brand. when i was looking for cleansers that were non-lathering and hydrating but didn't contain cetyl/cetearyl alcohol, they had a bunch!

It's probably going to make your maybe naturally oily face even oilier. And I don't think you should just use the cleanser because your face is oily, that seems like it is way too drying. Perhaps blot the oil away instead using blotting papers?\n\nDo you have any problems with the moisturizer? If not, you can keep it. Otherwise, try something else, because perhaps you're not moisturizing enough that you have such an oily face. Or perhaps your skin is just naturally like that. And those black dots on your nose that reoccurs like that is most likely [sebaceous filaments](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1fmg0t/some_more_information_about_sebaceous_filaments/), which is normally how those pores are. You can reduce their appearance with OCM, AHA, or BHA.\n\n\n"
"I didn't patch test, and I'm regretting that. I didn't really use anything before. If I wore makeup I just took it off with soap and sometimes I would put regular lotion on my face. "
"I started OCM about a week ago and so far I've just been using mineral oil. I bought castor oil and TTO over the weekend though and really wanna add them into my OCM routine to help my acne. I've already test patched them on my arm and didn't have any kind of reaction to either of them, so when can I add them into my routine? I've read some posts that say to add 1 new product every 2-6 weeks but I really don't wanna wait that long if I don't have to :/ "

"It's not harmful unless you notice your skin getting worse from using both products simultaneously. However, there doesn't really seem to be a point to that. You're using the same product but with different percentages of AHA and a different application method. The Alpha Hydrox Oil Free will be more effective than the St. Ive's pads, which are pretty gentle skin but also has fragrance (if you have problems with that). It's probably easier to just stick to one product unless you like switching between products between night and day, different days, etc. \n\nThat being said, you said your problems are blemishes and bumps, which is very vague. An AHA will reduce PIH. If you want to treat acne, you'll want to use a BHA or spot treatment, like BP."
"Good luck, hope it works out for you "
"It actually got a lot better after some sleep so it's at a state where it's at least presentable. Sorry!"
"I've been using it for years and every time I've strayed from it I end up disappointed and switch back. Collagen and elastin are not topically effective, so that part is irrelevant, but it's cheap, moisturizes very effectively, sinks in quickly without a greasy residue, and doesn't clog my pores or irritate my skin (even with the fragrance, which is pretty low in the ingredient list.) My only gripe is that the tub packaging isn't very hygienic, so I transfer it into a squeeze bottle."
"&gt; Otherwise everyone who uses sunscreen would be an albino.\n\ni'm so confused by your logic here. please look at the parts of your skin that never get exposed to the sun (eg. your butt). are those albino white? also, how do you apply this logic to non-white people? do you think that black people just never wear sunscreen, and that a black person would turn albino white if they wore sunscreen all the time? literally all you have to do is look at the world around you to see that this isn't true."
"Okay. Thanks."

"Thank you!"
"Too bad I'm ragweed sensitive, I was hoping I could use one of those. Drat! Thanks for letting me know.\n\nYes, I was thinking of hemp seed! Since the samples are a pack of three, I was thinking of adding evening primrose too...but I have no idea what to do for my third oil."
"If you only break out sporadically, I wouldn't regularly use BP. You can definitely use it as a spot treatment any problem areas when you do have a breakout, but stick with the AHA/BHA for daily upkeep."
"What do you mean by normal exfoliating glove? Salux cloth is a specific type of scratchy-feeling fabric for the purpose of exfoliating dead skin that rubs off of damp body skin. Some exfoliating gloves are made if salux. Some are made of other materials which are less effective."
"is your skin dry? oily? are you usually acne-prone? if your skin is not very dry, i would probably suggest stopping the cerave in the tub for a bit first - you can moisturize at night with mineral oil and/or vaseline and try a gel moisturizer during the day. i think the tub is more commonly a clogging culprit than the cleanser. \n\nalso, since i just noticed you said it's only happening on the left side of your face, keep track of what touches your face for a few days to see if there's anything you do to one side but not the other (eg. talking on the phone, resting your face in your hand, sleeping on one side, etc)."
"I wouldn't use two different AHAs at the same time. You can combine the AHA with a BHA, since BHAs are oil soluble and AHAs are not they can work nicely together, but doubling up on the AHA seems like overkill. If you want to use both glycolic and lactic, I would switch off every other day instead."
"It probably is cheap because it's likely too impractical a volume for consumer use"
"thank you! I will look into it"
"I'm not sure what they're made of, but I have these: \n\nhttp://www.thebodyshop.co.uk/bath-body-care/accessories/bath-gloves.aspx"
"The MUAC mandelic acid toner is great! It's 5% I think. They also have a 10% serum."
"Is it possible that Cetaphil in a tub can prevent razor burn on my legs? Bought it for my face, got tiny bumps on my face from it. Started using it on my body and I swear it has made a difference with the bad razor burn I usually get after shaving."
"I don't have moles or know much about them, but you could look into getting them removed if they bother you."
"thank you! I will buy some oil blotting sheets. "
"I've been using Jack Black's lip balm, in both the Shea Butter scent and the Lavender scent. Both are really nice, and a bit thicker than just Vaseline. They stick well to the lip and really moisturize nicely. I'll use it in the morning after exfoliating lightly with my toothbrush, and then throughout the day if I feel like I need to. At night, I'll apply some more and then put Vaseline or some other petroleum-based jelly on top. The balm moisturizes and the Vaseline locks in the moisture so none escapes while you're sleeping (a problem for mouth-breathers!)."
"I'll try that, thanks!"

"But what about the 2 oz bottle. Isn't that at practical amount? And it's still less expensive than 1 oz on GOW"
"Yes, sebaceous filaments is what I most likely have after googling it! I will keep reading and find out how to reduce their appearance. There is no difference between products for girls and guys right? (A guy here)"
"you would want to dilute both of them, since they can be pretty drying. you can add them to your mineral oil for ocm, or you can use diluted tto as a spot treatment (castor oil does not work as well for spot treating). in 8oz of mineral oil or another carrier oil, you would want to add about 2oz of castor oil and/or 1/4tsp of tto to start out!"
"I just ran that through Cosdna and from what I gather, they look to be the exact same thing. I use Elda MD Facial and love it... so now I know what I'll be buying when I run out."
"Nope. Absolutely not. "
"[deleted]"
"bar soap or body washes containing SLS can be drying. i shower every day and use a moisturizing body wash (olay something with moisturizing ribbons or whatever), but i only actively wash my torso. arms and legs and everything can get clean enough from suds during rinsing. \n\nif your shower soap is drying you out, switch to a moisturizing body wash. and also apply moisturizer right after the shower!"
"I tried the deep detox and it was fine for about 2 minutes and then it started to burn so much i had to take it off, I dont reccommend it at all."
"I use it every morning underneath my foundation. I like it because it's lighter than CeraVe, which I think is too heavy for me personally to wear under makeup, but I would never use it as my primary moisturizer - it's too light for that. A little goes a long way.\n\n"
"Oh I thought it said 4lbs, oops. \nIt's still be hard to use up before it goes bad I'd think?"
"hormonal acne is notoriously difficult to treat with topical products, especially if you get deep or cystic breakouts. it's often more effective to treat the root of the problem, so you may want to talk to your doctor about your options. most girls can easily solve the problem by going on oral bc or switching bc if they're already on one; it's slightly trickier if you're a guy, but not impossible.\n\nbenzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, sulfur, and tea tree oil (diluted) are all effective spot treatments! and you should be able to find inexpensive otc products containing any of those."
"You could look into a DIM supplement. I've been taking one for about three months and it's cleared up the stubborn acne on my neck and jawline. "
"well moisturizing your skin can make it generally healthier and more resilient, so yes! also having well-moisturized skin probably means that there's less friction during shaving, which would cut down on razor burn."
"have you tried mineral oil?"
"&gt; not certified in Canada\n\nOh holy hell!  Then don't go back!  Why would you go back to someone who can't even adequately treat you?\n"
"Why don't we talk more prominently about putting sunscreen on hands as well as face as part of the beginner routine? It seems like it would be an important point to make."
"Are you talking about the Abreva Conceal? I've read the back of the packaging and they're just non medicated stickers. Very expensive stickers if you ask me. This is what they've posted on their website - http://www.abreva.com/cold-sore-products/abreva-conceal-patch/about \n\nA colloid bandage is \"coated with a cross-linked adhesive mass containing a dispersion of gelatin, pectin and carboxy-methylcellulose together with other polymers and adhesives forming a fexible wafer. When the dressing comes into contact with wound exudate, the polysaccharides and other polymers absorb water and swell, forming a gel. The moist conditions produced under the dressing promote fibrinolysis, angiogenesis and wound healing, without causing maceration\" (source - http://www.dressings.org/Dressings/granufl-brd.html).  "
"I don't have experience with that particular site, but I have used a bulk distributor (newdirectionsaromatics) and their prices are on par to that. [Here](http://www.newdirectionsaromatics.com/argan-carrier-oil-p-1741.html) is their section for argan oil. It's basically the same price (I can't math because my body is bloodless currently) so I'm not overly suspect of bulkapothecary. Personally I'd use NDA, simply because the quality of their products is amazing and I've had great experiences ordering from them, but that's me. Check the INCI and MSDS if you're still unsure. That's usually where you'll catch the mention of adulterants."
"I wouldn't say that using an AHA for 10 days and experiencing a lightening of your PIH is wishful thinking! If my St. Ive's pads (which have considerably less AHA) didn't do anything in 10 days, I'd be annoyed."
"the beginner's routine is specifically a facial skincare routine, so it covers everything you need to put on your face and nothing else. however, whenever sunscreen is brought up in discussion on this sub, everyone is always clear about saying that it should go on any exposed skin. :)"
"- CeraVe\n- Cetaphil\n- Eucerin\n\nAll relatively inexpensive, all commonly recommended."
"I stumbled upon this thread, but Target in the US sells Boots and No. 7!\n"
"Yeah, that's why I like it to but I rarely see it mentioned on this sub. It's not my nighttime moisturizer but I do like it during the day under makeup. Thanks!"
"You make good points and I apologize, you're right that this isn't a mental health discussion board. That being said, I wasn't the one who brought it up and I would never shame someone for seeking treatment for depression, including meds."
"Fair enough."
"Maybe something like 10%? You could go higher, body skin tends to be a lot more resilient. "
"I use olive oil soap. It doesn't dry me out at all. I'm just in fear that daily shower with soap will do damage to the skin.\n\nps. Are you a guy?"
"The canker sore bandaids I have are called, \"Canker Cover: The Oral Canker Sore Patch\". It says the only active ingredient is Menthol (2.5%). I haven't used them on my sebaceous cyst because the box says its for canker sores/injury to the mouth/gums, and the cyst is external (on my chin)."
"Product I love: De La Cruz 10% sulfur ointment. It's really effective at drying out my spots and making them go away.\n\nProduct I don't love so much: Neutrogena Pure and Free Baby sunscreen. Holy kabuki, Batman! (Although, it did feel really gentle going on and smelled neutral, so, there's that.)"
"Alcohol and alcohol denat are drying. Cetyl /cetearyl /stearyl alcohol are moisturizing alcohols. Citrus juice is dangerous because it contains photosesitizing compounds. Citric acid is used in small amounts as a pH adjuster and is safe. Coconut derivatives are potentially comedogenic. Tocopherol acetate in small quantities will probably not have any impact on your scars"
"no, using soap daily won't do any damage if your skin doesn't feel dry or tight afterwards. although it is generally a good idea to use some kind of lotion after your shower to trap in the moisture from the shower!\n\nps. no, but skincare is all gender neutral. :)"
"I have a few.\n\n1. I want to start eating according to keto which I have to wait on until money. Everything in the house is a carb and no one wants to help me out. I also want to start drinking green smoothies. I know these don't *seem* skincare related but I eat crap so I want to see if changing my diet will do anything. I have a bunch of random ailments that don't seem to have a medical basis so I wonder if it might be tied to my diet.\n\n2. Start making my own beauty products. There's a cleansing oil recipe I want to try, a DIY salt spray recipe I want to try, the vitamin C serum/spray I want to try, a powdered goat's milk cleanser I want to try... I have a *lot* of ideas on the back burner.\n\n3. Find something to replace neem. It works like literal magic for me but the smell is just so rank. This past week I haven't wanted to smell like I slept the night in a thai dumpster, so my skin has been starting to give me trouble. Neem just smells so bad! D: Ugh. I have a few oils on my list to pick up/try."
"Am I over doing it on the chemical exfoliation? The below is my daily routine.\n\nAM\n\nTony Moly Red Appletox Honey (gel AHA moisturizer) \n\nShiseido Sunblock\n\nPM \n\nRise face with water \n\nSilk Naturals 2% BHA toner \n\nSilk Naturals 8% AHA toner\n\nClinque Dramatically Different Moisturizing lotion  \n\nBefore this routine I had dry flaky patches (mostly between my brows and on my nose), but the AHA dramatically reduced that and the Tony Moly gel eliminated it. Currently my skin is normal to oily. I started using a stronger AHA  for my closed comedones (mostly on my forehead), but there has been no difference. I continue to use it because I think it's giving my skin a nice glow.   "

"i would not use something with menthol on a cyst - that would be irritating. you can buy regular hydrocolloid bandages (they are sold either by that name or sometimes as blister bandages), which would protect the open wound and help things drain. \n\nalso have you seen a derm or a doctor? i'm not sure how serious whatever you have is, but a \"raw open cyst\" sounds like something you might want to seek professional advice on rather than trying to treat it by yourself."
"Also wanna add that 30% is an EXTREMELY high concentration and should only be used if you are able to move up from lower concentrations gradually without problems."
"Do you find the sunscreen to be moisturizing? It has moisturizing, emollient, and occlusive properties that you would find in a typical lotion, and is a sunscreen, so if you feel too greasy with the CeraVe Moisturizing Cream and the Aveeno Protect, perhaps just use Aveeno Protect?"
