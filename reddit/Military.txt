"I started really looking the year before I got out. Soon found out that the school I really wanted to attend had prerequisites that I never achieved in high school. I think it was Algebra II/Trig and something else. I had to have completed those courses before I even applied. Since I wasn't in a position to take any online coursework, I went to CC instead and then transferred. Worked out the best for me I think. Was an easier transition. \n\nOnly thing I missed out on, in retrospect, was not being able to major in Arabic. They had a 3 year program that pretty much gets you a 3/3 in the language.

During the cold war the biggest donor in aid to the Soviet Union was the US, in return, the USSR gave some concessions in various matters important to the US, whenever possible.

"Depends on the school/state.  Some schools do rolling admissions, some don't.  Some have narrow admissions windows, some have broad.  Start getting things in order now.  Find schools you're interested in, and see when they allow admissions.  Some schools use the same admissions system, which makes it cheaper/easier to apply.  For example, California public schools use a single system for the CSUs, and another for the UCs.  The Common App is another.\n\nAs far as in state tuition is concerned, look into the Yellow Ribbon program.  This is for out of state students or private school tuition.  Basically, it's an optional program for schools to help cover the left over tuition.\n\nYou also want to look at the state benefits.  Additional educational benefits aren't uncommon."

"The best scenes involve the focus on the terrain, the SEALs yomping up the hills, twisting ankles, ultimately tumbling and falling down the mountain with numerous objects taking a toll on their bodies. I read a review saying that the movie was cliched in showing the Americans as supermen where as I saw it as the opposite. These men got chewed a part and stayed on their feet for the fight. Every fall, every bullet does damage and we feel it and more importantly we see and hear it. They can hardly breathe, they lose concentration, they get dazed/confused/scared and ultimately regain their composure when the bullets continue flying as they were trained. The sound of *wheezing* will break your heart in this film. The battle scene and its acting is fucking brilliant and different.\n\nThe third act is weak as hell though. Sloppily put together, the set pieces and wardrobes look cheap as fuck all of a sudden and count how many Afghan's have really heavy eye liner. Frankly, its underplayed. In the book and in the story all together, this is truly as exciting and admirable as the battle. Yet it's essentially scanned over, shoddily no less. Lots of piss poor decisions movie production wise in the last act make the over all film less enjoyable. \n\nAND yes I am aware he really was rescued and taken care of by the village, my problem isn't with the storyline. It's with production and screen writing.\n\nAnd then comes the epilogue before the credits. Pictures and videos of those lost and of Mr Luttrell. I was actually quite happy to get the chance to see the video footage of some of the men, we've all seen pictures, but to see them *live* is quite touching. And every time a photo showed a man with his kids my heart sank further. \n\nFirst hour and half 4/4\nThird Act 2/4\nPrologue/Credits 4/4\n\n"

They're incredibly demotivated because they see their time in the military as stolen away from them for no reason. They get nothing out of it. North Korea is a totally different situation. Being underfed and mistreated is par for the course in North Korea, but the military gets more food than average and has better benefits as well. For the North, the military is the entire point of the nation; everything feeds into it and supports it. Their entire communist cult revolves around it, which is why their soldiers would be so effective (relatively speaking): they're heavily indoctrinated and really do believe that fighting and dying for their country is a great honor. Obviously not every single person is convinced, but that's what you'd expect from anywhere.\n\n&gt;And don't give me that brainwashed bullshit, because they really aren't- they realize that there's something wrong, but also are oppressed so much that they know they can't do much about it.\n\nYou're just projecting your own feelings onto them out of ignorance.

"North Korean military are basically made of conscripts, and the nation is a heavily militarized one, comparable to the Theme systems of the Byzantine Empire and the ëì (å±¯ç°) system in the Han Chinese era. \n\nThey are chronically underfed and the morale has never been so low, to the point that the crimes that these soldiers commit are apparently causing problems in NK. Source: http://news.donga.com/3/all/20110914/40301677/1\n\nAccording to this article half of NK soldiers suffer from some form of malnutrition, and that each ration contains only 100 grams of food. \n\nThe morale is so low that according to this article, over 320,000 soldiers are AWOL: http://www.rfa.org/korean/in_focus/nk_nuclear_talks/unlaw-09062013101846.html\n\nAccording to this article, on July 14th, the NK Brass had a surprise visit onto the border patrols in the city of ë§í¬ (Manpo), and each company was supposed to have 74 men: the average manpower in each company was at 55, with the lowest being 46, mostly from soldiers going AWOL. \n\nTheir soldiers are not effective- an army that is underfed cannot win against a technologically superior army that is much better fed, much better armed, with the support of the world's greatest army. \n\nAlso the sources for my claim that many are not brainwashed: (I do agree that this is not something that has an empirical data- but I will provide many firsthand accounts from defectors)\nThis is especially true after the ascension of Kim Jong Un, who has no real \"myth\" or \"legend\" to mystify and create a cult of personality. \n\nhttp://www.rcfnk.com/?document_srl=6722\nhttp://blog.daum.net/saenooree/16885828\nhttp://blog.donga.com/nambukstory/archives/74182\n\nThese are just conjectures by defectors, but since there are not many reliable sources for the reality in NK, this will have to do for now: \n\nBut the gist of these articles show that \n\n\n1. NK's brainwashing is mostly based on fear, and that \n\n\n2. the level of oppression has actually increased, which suggests that  more people are grumbling about the gov't suggesting that they are not fully \"brainwashed\" like Manchurian Candidate style. \n\n3. Especially under Kim Jong Un, there have been really nasty rumors that were unthinkable under earlier regimes, suggesting that the people have begun to turn away from the cult of personality. \n(For one, there are rumors that Ri Seol Ju, the wife of Kim Jong Un, was a high-class prostitute for various NK officials, and was involved in a porno scandal- quite similar to the pornographies published about Queen Marie Antoinette before the French Revolution, as a way for the underclass to undermine the authority of the state)\n\n\n\nI understand that many South Korean soldiers are not as professional as the US Army- but to say that their North Korean counterparts that are chronically underfed and underarmed are in a better state is just foolish. Both have problems arising from a conscript army, but at least the ROK army actually can feed its soldiers and provide them with arms. Oh and also they actually have oil to run tanks, and give its pilots precious flying time. \n\n\n"

"&gt;North Korean military are basically made of conscripts\n\nJust like the South Korean military. Like I said, not all conscripts are the same. In the South, being a conscript is the worst possible job. In the North, it's a pretty damn good one as it gives a person a chance to have a relatively decent life and protection from political persecution (hopefully).\n\n&gt;They are chronically underfed and the morale has never been so low, to the point that the crimes that these soldiers commit are apparently causing problems in NK. Source:\n\n...a 3 year old article from a South Korean paper... Not exactly a credible source for this subject. How would they know? Defectors? How would *they* know? They don't. The North is perfectly capable of sending out false reports to make people think they need all kinds of aid when they actually don't. It's an easy way for them to get free stuff from others. That's basically the entire game the North has been playing for several decades now.\n\n&gt;The morale is so low that according to this article, over 320,000 soldiers are AWOL\n\nAnd is *this* a reliable source? Also, they state that anyone missing for just 4 hours is a deserter. \n\n&gt;Their soldiers are not effective- an army that is underfed cannot win against a technologically superior army that is much better fed, much better armed, with the support of the world's greatest army.\n\nThat's bullshit. Just look at history. Soldiers are *always* underfed in battle. *Always*. And yet they are still able to function, and their armies are able to function for years in a row. This notion that hungry troops are less effective is utter nonsense and backed up by nothing. If anything it means the North Korean troops will be *more* effective in battle because they've trained all their lives with little food. They have months worth of stockpiles, so they wouldn't starve. \n\n&gt;Also the sources for my claim that many are not brainwashed: (I do agree that this is not something that has an empirical data- but I will provide many firsthand accounts from defectors) This is especially true after the ascension of Kim Jong Un, who has no real \"myth\" or \"legend\" to mystify and create a cult of personality.\n\nPart of the problem with defectors is that they are usually a certain kind of person that defects in the first place. They're not loyal, which means they're not exactly trustworthy. A person like that will also seek to validate his/her actions by justifying them, and one way of doing that is by projecting their own beliefs and feelings onto others who aren't there to defend themselves. Defectors simply should not be looked at as reliable sources of information, especially for such matters that no one could possibly know anyway (like what most people are thinking).\n\n&gt;NK's brainwashing is mostly based on fear, and that\n\nFear is a powerful motivator and shouldn't be discounted. It worked well for the Soviets during World War 2. It has worked well throughout history, where armies would conscript those they capture and force them to fight.\n\n&gt;the level of oppression has actually increased, which suggests that more people are grumbling about the gov't suggesting that they are not fully \"brainwashed\" like Manchurian Candidate style.\n\nThe Manchurian Candidate is not the only kind of brainwashing. It's a much higher form of direct programming. There are other forms of passive programming that work all over the world and throughout history. Just look at the US for example. Americans are brainwashed to love their country unequivocally, and the vast majority do, to one degree or another. The majority of Americans think America is the greatest country in the history of the world, because that's what our government tells us to think. Even poor people talk about how they love America and freedom and all that, and everyone worships the military and our constitution and our \"freedom\". It's a different format from North Korea, but the same kind of principle. In North Korea, however, there is a greater level of fear that goes with that programming. People grumble about the US government, but most would probably say America is still the best, or could be the best. My point is that just because they're not being actively programmed doesn't mean they aren't getting brainwashed. And just because they complain doesn't mean they don't fully believe in their government and their mission and all that.\n\n&gt;Especially under Kim Jong Un, there have been really nasty rumors that were unthinkable under earlier regimes, suggesting that the people have begun to turn away from the cult of personality.\n\nThat's probably why he is purging his government, to show the country that he's the head figure and he means business. And he probably is losing his grasp on power, and the regime could very well crumble. However, I think it's reasonable to assume that Kim Jong-un will choose war, or a reckless provocation that leads to war, over allowing his regime and thus country to fall apart, which would result in civil war and conquest by the South anyway. \n\n&gt;I understand that many South Korean soldiers are not as professional as the US Army\n\nThat's a *huge* understatement. I'm saying that the South Korean soldiers aren't anywhere close to the US Army. But I also don't think the US Army is as good as it or the rest of the world thinks. It suffers from a lot of different kinds of problems, especially with its higher ranking officers (they're all Yes-men idiots, basically). \n\n&gt;but to say that their North Korean counterparts that are chronically underfed and underarmed are in a better state is just foolish.\n\n\"Underarmed\"?? I don't think you'll find any source that says that. They have huge stockpiles of weapons and ammo. Just because they use a lot of old designs doesn't mean those designs won't get the job done. And like I said, they aren't \"underfed\" if you consider what combat conditions would be like. And they probably have plenty of food and are just lying to get more from the South. Regardless of those issues, the North Korean army is in a much better state of preparedness to fight an all out war than the South due to a multitude of factors that would take too much time to go over.\n\n&gt;Both have problems arising from a conscript army, but at least the ROK army actually can feed its soldiers and provide them with arms.\n\nThey do that in the North, too. Otherwise, they wouldn't have a military.\n\n&gt;Oh and also they actually have oil to run tanks, and give its pilots precious flying time.\n\nThey do that in the North, too. After Kim Jong-un came to power, he increased the number of flying hours pilots got to numbers comparable to pilots in the South. Of course, just looking at hours tells you nothing, because the two sides have totally different strategies and tactics and goals, so their training will be completely different (as it might take more hours to do one training exercise than another).\n\nMy entire point is that the North is a very serious threat to the South and should never be dismissed. No one should assume they will just roll over and die like the Iraqi army, or something. No one should assume war with North Korea would be easy or an acceptable outcome to a crisis or anything like that. It's something South Koreans should constantly be preparing themselves for instead of going through their daily lives as if the threat doesn't exist."
"It doesn't. DODT is down, so you can say what you want about that. However, the gay marriage thing is definitely a political issue.

"&gt;Until I have evidence of their unit association, I call them nothing.\n\nAll evidence points to \"French Section nautique d'intervention offensive\" (SNIO).\n\n&gt;Number 2 was referencing your 'knowledge' of how many ways you can design a sub-machine gun.\n\nYou're an idiot. I said \"there's only so many ways to design a sub-machine gun\", as in there are only so many ways to accomplish the desired task, which is to shoot pistol ammunition quickly and accurately at short ranges. A weapon like the Kriss sure is cool, but essentially what they did was create a complicated bolt system to solve a minor problem than can be taken care of in much easier ways. Do you think a Kriss is grunt-proof? Doubt it. Do you think it adds a significant capability over other sub-machine guns? I don't think so. Is it an easy acquisition for a military force? Not at all. There's a reason why you didn't think about these factors.\n\n&gt; Any photograph designed to promote something, should make sure that something isn't fucking up. In every way, their trigger discipline matters, but I wouldn't expect someone like you to understand that.\n\nYeah? How does it matter, then?\n\n&gt;You're talking out of your ass.\n\nYou *are* an ass, so I guess I'm in the right place.\n\n&gt;If you have any experience whatsoever, it certainly doesn't show.\n\nHeh, you'll say anything, you're so mad!\n\n&gt;Most individuals that post here have military experience.\n\nLike me?\n\n&gt;throwing out shit like \"They're basically the French equivalent of the SEALs.\"\n\nDo you know what the term \"basically\" means? Should I explain it to you?\n\n&gt;\"US Seals still use the MP-5, which is from the 60's.\" WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? \n\nI'm talking about the [Navy SEALs using the MP-5](http://navyseals.com/weapons-demo/), which is also a pretty old design. The other guy was talking about being surprised that the Uzi was still around (because it's an old design from the 50's). My point was that just because a weapon is old doesn't mean it's obsolete. I even said \"we're talking about sub-machine guns here\". Are you daft or something?\n\n&gt;You have no working knowledge, so don't propagate bullshit.\n\nOh yeah? *YOU* have no working knowledge! OOOO! SLAM! See? I can throw meaningless insults right back at ya.\n\n&gt;Also, if they are SNIO, then I would call them SNIO.\n\nThen why don't you call them SNIO? Or are you calling them SNIO right now?\n\n&gt;They are not an 'equivalent' to SEALs, they are a unique force that vaguely shares focus with the aforementioned.\n\nThat's why I used the modifier \"basically\", because the comparison is not exact and was only ever meant to give someone a rough idea of what they do. Considering the fact that they perform the same basic role and are tasked with a lot of the same kinds of missions, I'd say that my comparison was fair and accurate. I think you're confused because you must think the SEALs are all like Team 6 or whatever.\n\n&gt;Cross-training and shared focus does not an equivalent make.\n\nLOL! OK, then what *would* make an equivalent? Or a *basic* equivalent, if you'd like to do what I was doing and not what you were doing...\n\n&gt;EDIT: Also, the UZI fucking sucks.

"I was very grossed out by this movie. Here are these elite forces, and they don't speak a word of the Afghan language. They debate whether or not to commit murder against civilians, and barely make the right choice. For all of their elite training in the end they don't look very elite, and most of the movie is spent falling down a mountain. \n\n\nWhen Mark Walberg is helped by an Afghan man and the man gives him food and drink and Mark gorges himself on it like a hog, never saying thank you, spending the time only to grumble out \"Tex-ass\" to a little boy, it reminded me that the American military is a big welfare queen who isn't at all heroic or noble like soldiers were in the past during actual justified wars. When you look at a decorated WW2 general, and a decorated modern general, and you can see the many many pieces of flair the modern general is wearing its like a fucking joke. The pageantry betrays complete weakness and rot. The new American soldier is a fat kid playing hero with a bunch of toys. I'm not sure that I can blame Al Qaeda for their actions against US soldiers any longer. I hate to see my countrymen die, but if you unjustly invade a people, they have the right to repel you. \n\n\nThis movie is like a German propaganda film. A true piece of shit.

"When I was active duty, I looked down on reservists... mostly because I was a junior rank back then and I hated when the reservist would be integrated with us for like, two weeks, and I had NCO's that were giving me shit... I didn't like taking shit from part timers. I assumed these guys didn't know shit about the military and were only weekend warriors.\n\nNow, I'm an NCO reservist and I make sure that I'm not that guy. I find myself often on the other side of things, doing my AT and integrating with the AD folk. I now realize that as a reservist, we've got two lives to maintain, a civilian career and a military one. I've also realized that not all reservist are clueless, having spent 4 years active duty and two deployments myself, I like to think I know a thing or two about active duty life. But like I said, I now experience the opposite side when I do my AT (two weeks active a year) with 18 year old boots and I can see how they don't really like having us around all the time.  \n\nEdit: furthermore, I've learned that some reservist have so much more to offer to the active duty side than any active duty serviceman could. For instance, I'm in an MP unit now and we've got a special agent with the FBI as one of our E5's, whose been with the FBI for over ten years. He's got qualifications in so much shit it's insane, from interrogations to hostage negotiations, this guy's the real deal... when we're on our AT he works with the training department for the AD folk and provides interesting training to the AD MP's. We also have CIA agents, State Troopers and a shit ton of law enforcement officers that bring actual hands on experience in law enforcement to the job when working on active duty."

"Not many jobs in the AF actually put women in the line of fire in the AOR. Usually those jobs that it does happen are:\n\nVehicle ops or Supply (yes they do use supply too) on convoy\n\nSecurity Forces patrolling the parameter\n\nAs a combat advisor for any AFSC that is useful to Afghanistan\n\nWith the changing of the rules that allows women into combat oriented jobs, they are required to have the same level of fitness, however, all AF combat jobs have always required a much higher standard of fitness across the board for everyone! So the standard testing you see is much lower than what CCT, PJ, SERE (Which has ALWAYS allowed women), and TACP must do. And those schools have a washout rate of at least 80%. \n\nNow, that being said. I read somewhere in the mil thread where someone complained that a female wouldn't be able to pick up a 200 lb male in full gear so they shouldn't be allowed if they can't do the same standards. Don't kid yourself. A 200 lb male in full gear would not be picking up another 200 lb male in full gear. Especially under fire. You would be dragging them and a female could possibly do that. In fact, I practiced doing that in training before going to Afghanistan. I'm around 125 pounds and I could do it. If you want to see what a realistic fitness requirement that is similar to what you would actually be doing in combat is, look here: \n\nhttp://www.military.com/military-fitness/marine-corps-fitness-requirements/marine-corps-combat-fitness-test\n\nYou would not be running a mile and a half, you would be sprinting a short range to safety in full gear, dragging yourself in full gear, lifting and holding an ammo can over your head repeatedly, etc. "

"It is a very sticky subject, which will probably get worse before it gets better. On the one hand, the civilians that control the military seem to want it to represent the populace in all ways, which means minimizing female exclusions. On the other hand, the military is not representative of anything the civilian world does. So you wind up with differing standards. Is there a solution to that? I dunno. \n\nThe experience that affected me the most was in flight training, when I had to run the obstacle course. I tore my shoulder out on the six-foot wall and had to spend a month rehabbing in the weight room. When they thought my shoulder was strong enough, I rolled into the next class to try the wall again. I remember as I pulled myself up (waiting to see whether I'd hear a pop again) seeing out of the corner of my eye a female run by the wall, tapping it. That's all they had to do. Just run right by the (arguably) most difficult part of the o-course, which was a pass/fail thing--either you passed and progressed through flight training, or you failed and got your ticket home.\n\nWhile I was not a fan of that particular double standard, I'd have a hard time arguing against changing the o-course to better assess both genders under a single standard. (The o-course eventually went away altogether.)  I'm not sure if you could do the same for realistic combat physical assessments, though. It'll be interesting to see how this develops over the next five years."

This example isn't always relevant, I acknowledge that, but it is important.  \n\nBottom line - If you don't have the ability to carry me, even if my gear has been stripped and divided, then I don't want you on my team.\n\nThat was the only real issue I had with your post, just wanted to put that in."

All the while standing alongside a reservist (from time to time) who is peeved by this \"other job\". \n\nI don't know if Naval Reserves differ from other branches, or if I've had the bad luck of working with a lot (and I mean a lot) of Shitty reservists, but they all left a bad taste in my mouth.

"If you are going to move a long distance (which most likely would not happen in the type of engagement we see, the equipment we use, etc) the fireman carry is still unpractical, unless you are the only two left, which is still highly unlikely and still very dangerous to do. \n\nEven then, the only forces that go in with the mission of active engagement are SF, and if your SF your fitness requirements go way beyond what is expected of everyone else. Everyone else usually falls under support in some fashion as in convoy, advisory, etc. In convoy, you are NOT getting out of the vehicle unless you have to, and even then, you are heading to another vehicle for safety. As an adviser, that gets a little tricky, but once again, a fireman carry would still be illogical for any situation I can think of.\n\nI don't know about you, but I worked outside the gate in Afghanistan and with all scenarios that could have happened and our day to day, I still can not imagine any instance where I would be utilizing a fireman carry.

"I wouldn't be worried either, and the reason I say that is SERE. They have always allowed women and they have never dropped the standard nor would they. If you are only utilizing half of your available population, you stand to lose what assets you could gain from that, and the advantage that it comes with. Are a lot of women going to qualify for an SF position? No. But that is not because they are women. It is because they have not conditioned themselves to the standard needed. There is no need to lower the bar, because then men who would not have been qualified would be allowed in too. It's not a gender issue. It's a training and physical ability issue.\n\n Would I ever in my top physical condition be qualified to be a PJ? Nope. But that is because I never strived to acquire that physical ability. Also, I am 5 foot nuthin. My height is a problem in a lot of aspects. Still not a gender issue, it's genetic. \n\nPersonally, I think the fireman carry itself is a weak argument, but I think you and I are going to agree to disagree on this. There are many other items that would be a better argument in differences of who can and who can't, but once again. It's not a gender issue, it's a physical conditioning and ability issue. \n\nEDIT: I should also point out that I agree our experiences differ. I was an adviser to the ANP in 2010. I did NOT set out to be GI Jane or to be combat hua. I think some people got the misconception that women  who would still not be qualified in the slightest are gonna take off running to SF positions and expect to have the standard lowered. The ones that will, are going to expect the same treatment and strive for it. I think that the forces are in for a pleasant surprise, granted someone doesn't go and screw up what could be a good thing. "

"&gt;but do the military elite (Rangers, or Delta) train to keep the finger on the trigger, or \"worse\" keep a trigger half-drawed?\n\nI understand what you're thinking but the answer is *no*, and here's why:\n\nWhen you put your finger on the trigger or pulling it the the half-draw using the pressure receptors in your finger to tell you when to stop. You train with thousands of rounds on the range under certain stress, mental, and physiological conditions and with certain gear, i.e., gloves.\n\nWhen change and go to do it in real life, you're under different mental and physical conditions (fatigued, dehydrated), mental conditions (fear, anxiety), and physiological conditions (stress/cortisol, adrenaline). These difference cause dulling of, among other things, your peripheral senses. So what your muscle memory registered as the 4 lbs of force you used to half pull your trigger in training was actually 8 lbs of force which caused you do ND your weapon in a high-risk situation.\n\nThere's no real advantage to keeping your finger on the trigger, is what everyone learns from day one, and is one thing that's just best to stay that way."
"Here's the thing with us reservists. No, we do not do our job day in and day out. Most of us go to school and work in the civilian world. We are responsible for our own income, healthcare, housing, and transportation. Many of us have LOWER standards of living than  garrison active duty. \n\nOn top of that we are often asked to travel long distances on short notice to spend time getting paid much less and yelled at by people just as green as ourselves, only they have played the game 6 months longer. Add uniforms, gas, airport parking, chow, time away from work, and you can see why it isn't all sunshine and rainbow for us.\n\nFurther more add the thought that you will never deploy, never go on active duty, and never be relevant to the Marine Corps and you can see how motivation dies. A couple years into it you wonder why the fuck you are wasting your time for a unit that exists just for the sake of existing. \n\nI haven't done any MOS relevant training since our AT in July. \n\nBeing OFP has its down sides because you really are on your own. The Marine Corps doesn't give a fuck as long as you show up when you get an email saying it's time to drill.\n\nAnd it's not like we are a bunch of shitbags either. We know that we  don't have much experience doing our jobs. Had some guys ask me how I only had one ribbon as a lance with such long hair. I just laughed and said \"we're all boot camp honor grads\"."

"Wow you live in Miami,  the bah must be great there,  seriously use the gi bill,  all universities do career events and help you get jobs through their career center,  don't waste time you can still get into spring semester if you have your gi bill paperwork "
"Well, the subject is kinda getting a lot of attention lately because of the developments concerning women in combat roles. But my best guess is that in general, the standards are for having members be in good health and able to run, not to prepare them for combat. Women will be in shape with a different run time, so that's why they have less run requirements and less pushups. Situps are generally the same for both genders, though. \n\nJobs that require more physical strength or stamina tend to do that with their own people I believe, rather than having everyone be the same fitness level despite some of them being combat and some of them being logistics who don't ever need to run for 5 miles with a ruck on their back. If you're SOF and just passing the standard PT, I'm pretty sure you're very wrong. "

"That's very easy for you to say, sir. (I'll try and be respectful here, but you come off very smug) \n\nMany joes do not know what is available to them and/or they are not given adequate time to take care of their needs prior to ETS. I guarantee an SNCO does not have to jump through the same hoops\n\nI got so much grief over going to my authorized ACAP appointments. My friend who signed up for classes got labelled a shitbag because it got him out of some field time. Field time that was useless because a big chunk of us were ETS'ing. You know what the PSG did after that? Nobody got classes anymore and the CO pretty much said tough shit.\n\nI hope you give your ETSers enough time to get what they need done. Don't send them to rot in the field out of spite. I'm sure they gave their all for the deployments and training. I'm not saying excuse them from Motorpool Mondays^^^TM or from required training, but perhaps cut them a little slack. Realistically though, taking classes is just not feasible. Maybe OP tempo has slowed down? People did classes done downrange but I don't know the climate now.\n\nPlease, don't give people shit because they have terminal leave and *gasp* they want to use it.\n\nMy GI bill is awesome though, so at least there's that."

"I know you're not supposed to travel in uniform, but I have heard people ordered to arrive at and depart from post in uniform."
"Education. That's what companies are looking for. Like others have said, use that GI Bill, whether it's for certificates, associate's, or a bachelor's degree. Unless you had a technical job in the military (bonus if you had a security clearance), 'veteran' status just isn't enough for a decent-paying office job.\n\nAt the very least, taking a few classes would show employers that you're trying to improve yourself instead of sitting around doing nothing."

"Tradoc requires all IET soldiers to travel in uniform which is completely stupid. Apparently it was because too many were acting stupid so they thought 1. it will get them to mature a little and 2. you can immediately tell who is IET and allows any NCOs travelling to watch them. In reality people act the same now just in uniform. Especially when they straight out of basic and free for the first time in nearly 3 months.\n\nPersonally if they want to make basic training soldiers travel in uniform to AIT I have no problem, but as an AIT soldier in tradoc for 2 years unless the army wants to pick up the bill for my flight home on HBL I'd like to travel in what ever I'd like."

"Reserves to AD is a lot harder than you think it is. I'm currently a active drilling reservist who's deployed. \n\nAD doesnt want to pay an experienced E4, E5 to learn a new job when they can just train newbies at E1 E2. \n\nPlus being a reservist who's trying to go AD, I can tell you from first hand experience that it's a royal pain in the ass. Recruiters will not pay attention to you at all. \n\n"

"Well I am a reservist right now, just wondering in between the interactions between reservists and regulars."

"I've been a reservist in the AF for 6 years now and I recently returned from my first deployment. Up until the deployment I've always looked down on my own reserve counterparts. It's a combination of us literally not doing a single important thing at low ranks, and hearing AD talk about their experience with reservists. \n\nThen came the inspections and exercises. It further perpetuated the stereotypical reservist that doesnt know what the hell they're doing. \n\nThen came our preparation for deployment. That's when shit really hit the fan and I started to actually feel like a soldier. We hit the ground running and deployed with an entire Aerial Port team of 47 people. \n\nWe had small teams of 2, 3 airmen come in from bases all over the place, but the Port leadership was all reservists. My team and I built pallets for military members going into Afghanistan, and any other AF, Army, Marine Corps, Navy or DoD personnel we encountered were shocked when we said we were reservists. \n\nWe also encountered true shit bags from Active Duty components of each branch who dont follow rules, who think they're holier than thou, who think they are better than the AF in general. \n\nShit bags will be everywhere. Active Duty, Reserves, every single branch. My team and I encountered over 400-500 military personnel each and every day and I think I can say it was a good enough sample size. \n\nAs long as you do your job, follow orders and stay within your rank and your limits, you're alright in my book. Regardless of branch, military status or service\n"

"Yeah, Post 9\\11 hasn't paid break pay since 2010, I think.\n\nYou should have had two payments, though.  One is your second half of the book stipend."
