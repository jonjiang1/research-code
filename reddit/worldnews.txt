"How does this create a bigger obstacle for women only?  If my wife (who kept her name) purchased a ticket, she couldn't transfer it to me any more than I could transfer it to her.  If we had children, and they carried my name, she couldn't transfer it to them.  If they carried her name, I couldn't.  Seems completely even.  \n\nThis is a policy that is clearly designed to reduce fraud.  And there doesn't seem to be an easy way around it.  If you open it up so that the spouses need not share each other's name, but still want to ensure that only couples take advantage of the option, then you need to arrange for people to provide proof of marriage.  I don't have the first clue where my marriage certificate is, and even if I did, I don't like the idea of some random airline having a copy of it.  But, assuming you get past that issue, now we can start talking about how to deal with common-law folks.  After all, excluding them because of religion isn't fair either.  So what for them?  Perhaps submitting last years tax statements?  Selfies in front of the house?  \n\nThe fact that it comes in contact with a women's issue (taking a husband's last name) does not inherently make it sexist.  In this particular case, it is simply practical.  "

"&gt; To avert climate change means making a sacrifice in the short term to avoid a very bad outcome in the future. In all likelihood climate will be far past the tipping point before the threat is imminent enough to motivate people.\n\nI'd just like to clear up a popular misconception here. Climate change has already happened. It will continue to happen more. There's no magic fix to go back to the way the world was (pre-industrial). \n\nWhat we *can* do is try to ameliorate future climate change, to make it less-bad. It's still going to suck, mostly for people in developing countries where regulation will be untenable (due to the demands of wealthier countries). If there is a tipping point (most climate scientists agree that there is a transition to a different stable-state ahead), we may already have [so much momentum](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=99888903) that we WILL reach it (momentum that [started during the industrial revolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Evidence_CO2.jpg)). \n\ntl;dr: **We're probably stuck with both the present and future damage that is ALREADY going to take place (due to present and past climate damage).

"Its not going to be something like a Sci-fi movie, where sudden disaster kills millions. No, see, what many don't understand is that climate change is a change in probabilities.

You play with it and nothing changes, the probability is the same. Now add another '10' card, not much changes, you can still play normally. Now add another, and another etc. Suddenly every hand you get is 2 10's, but so is the dealers, the only way you win is by getting an Ace, but the chances of that is now *very* low. The game has completely changed, and just like with climate change, you can't tell if was an added 10 or an original one that doomed you.\n\nSo maybe that Cat 5 hurricane that hit the Philippines would have happened if the industrial revolution had never occurred, maybe not.

"True to form.  It is, by and far, the best way to keep the issue in the spotlight and show the breadth and depth of the various programs.

"well, depending on how you define \"good\", climate change might be \"good\" (for the record, I think it's terrible).\n\nFor example, if you consider \"good\" in the grand ecological scheme of things, we humans are just expanding past the logistic growth pattern (an overgrowth, or expansion past K, the carrying capacity). We can observe this same trend in many other animal species, for example moose. When wolves are removed (see the [Isle Royale natural experiment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolves_and_moose_on_Isle_Royale)), the moose population explodes past carrying capacity. But the moose soon die off, because they destroy their environment (eat too much, etc) to the point where far fewer moose can be supported. That's what we're going through right now. we've expanded past the point where we can support everybody without screwing up our environment (taking into account political problems and current technology - if we had perfect infrastructure, our K would be higher). So in the sense that good = natural, climate change is somewhat expected given that we have no predators or other population limiting factors. This is called a state of disequilibrium, and I have a lot to say about it that won't fit in this comment :)\n\nor maybe you consider \"good\" to mean \"there are a ton of ways to make money off of climate change\", and there ARE. land speculation will be extremely lucrative with increased desertification and rising sea levels. You just need to hire some modeling people, do some GIS, and see where beach-front property will be in 30 years. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries is already speculating that tuna will go extinct - they are buying all they can and freezing them. "

One event we observed a foreign chinese vessel illegally fishing, (fishing in a closed area, double hauling, and using more traps than are legally allowed to use).\n\n&gt; We called the DFO to report it. We talked to 6 different DFO offices trying to get in contact with someone who would hear what we had to say. The 7th office we contacted they said they could send an officer out in 9 days to the location.\n\n&gt; The DFO is a joke, illegal fishing is happening, and there is NO protection to our fisheries and oceans.

Here's more from Regenecure:\n\nhttp://regenecure.co.il/technology\n\n&gt; REGENECURE's regenerative biocompatible polymeric membrane implants are made of microporous AMCA (ammonio methacrylate copolymer type A) and a plasticizer.\n\n&gt; The microporous surface of the membrane facilitates the adherence of stem cells (MSCs) recruited to the injured site through a signaling mechanism known as chemotaxis. The membrane allows excellent proliferation and differentiation of MSCs into the bone tissue. The membrane implant is strong and flexible, and serves as an effective barrier to prevent connective tissue from infiltrating the healing space and slowing down the regenerative healing process.\n\n&gt; REGENECURE’s implant can be shaped into a tube or a patch to span large segmental bone defects. The osteoconductive and osteoinductive qualities of the membrane ensure that REGENECURE’s MSC scaffolding method directs bone in-growth naturally into the tubular implant.\n\n&gt; The membrane implant operates both as a delivery system for cells and as a device for guided bone regeneration or tissue engineering purposes. It can also be used to deliver active agents such as osteoinductive, antiseptic agents, and more."

"Its not going to well. The people who make decisions that affect how we attempt to reduce Climate Change are by and large elected officials (whether or not they are elected by the people or large influential corporations in the end).

Its a hard sell. In the Third World, those people are not going to get reelected by telling their voters they can't have what the First World already has. Also a hard sell.\n\nThe voters themselves are typically human, they don't want to believe bad things can happen to them, they don't want to hear they can't have the lifestyle they aspire to, and they by and large put on blinders. Also not everyone has the time and intellect to study the science involved, so it all gets simplified to the point where many people don't trust the scientists because the people don't understand scientific theory sufficiently.\n\nI expect *millions* of people to die in the next few decades, from weather changes, drought, starvation, disease and the wars that will result from the competition over the dwindling resources we have left to us after intensively sucking them out of the planet for over 100 years.

"You can't encrypt the whole packet, just its contents.  The destination IP would be intact.  The source IP doesn't need to be real, so they could mask that it came from the printer.\n\nIf you were packet sniffing your network on a regular basis looking for any signs of something being off, what you would see is new packets going to an IP address you don't recognize, leaving your building's network, that weren't there before.  The likelihood of someone actually detecting this is pretty small, but it would be there for you to see.\n\nFrom there you would look for what's creating those packets.  If they used the printer's IP address, the chances of noticing it are high, and it would be easy to locate the source device.  So, since they have no need of replying to the printer, they probably would not do that.\n\n**Here's how it would go down if I worked for the NSA, and the smartest guy they had was me.**  (Neither of these are the case so I have to assume they would be able to be even sneakier.)\n\nThe printer, which is almost certainly connected to the company's network, would capture data.  It would construct encrypted packets, with a destination address of a company that is frequently contacted by automatic protocols and likely to be allowed through the firewall.  (Something like gmail.com.)  It would use a standard port and look for all the world like encrypted data being sent to one of those common trusted sites.  It would also forge the source IP and MAC address, rotating them between each communication, and it would have redundancy between packets so that packet loss can be corrected NSA-side without the need to ask for retransmission.\n\nThis lets the traffic get out, and obscures what's sending it.  Once the packet has left the building, **that packet is on networks the NSA can influence and has influenced.**  NSA-influenced equipment would notice the packets going to gmail.com, look at the encrypted data, see that they are NSA packets, and redirect them to the NSA.\n\nTo identify something was amiss, the company would have to notice the additional traffic among a preexisting pile of traffic that looks the same.  While a transmission was actively going, they would be able to trace the MAC address through their switch network, but if they looked later that entry would have expired and they would have to wait for the next transmission, which would be a different MAC.  Even then, they would only see suspicious traffic going to gmail, and would bark up the wrong tree.  They would only be wise to NSA bugging if they somehow realized that packets sent to gmail matching certain patterns were being redirected to the NSA using nonstandard route redirection outside their network.\n\n(Edit) Yes I know, OR they could install a cellular antenna in the neighborhood and use wireless.  This requires two things:  Someone has to let the NSA use their rooftop, and there would be a new antenna for people to see.  This may or may not be a problem.  I can easily see them making it happen, IF the corporate office receives cell signal OK (many don't) and IF the corporate office is in a populated area where someone wouldn't notice an extra antenna.  (many aren't, or the office they want to bug would be the only suitable building.)\n\nI mainly wanted to present a possible real-life scenario for sneaking data out of a network, stemming from \"enough network experience to get in trouble\".\n\n**tl;dr:**  Forge the source IP and MAC, encrypt the data frame, send it to a server that already gets plenty of traffic from the building using the same protocol those packets use.  Then use an NSA device to recognize and redirect NSA snoop packets after they leave the building.  Nobody in the company would figure it out."

You can also encourage the 'doctrine' of fallibility- that is the concept that any of our knowledge about the world may be flawed, and that includes the Qur'an.  \n\nThe fundamental problem with religion is *not* that it's not true.  And although I believe it *is* untrue, it's no crime to be wrong.

However i do not agree with doing nothing and i do not agree with marching into these regions killing people.  If it takes a few weeks of house arrest provided power and food remains going then I am fine with that.  If my city suddenly was bombed and the city said.  \"The army is taking control and doing a sweep.  The city is on lock down and you will have to remain inside.

"True, but they can't keep quiet.

It was a premise of the legal agreement between the business in question and the NSA that the information could not be shared with the public, and if the company were to breach that, then there would be criminial reprecussions.  However, isn't that a two way street, with the comapnies expecting protection from a release that could effectively damage their reputation given the coercive nature of the requests?\n\nIt's shitty grounds for a suit, but could a company sue on the premise that any agreement made was expected to be protected and secured by the government, and that the breach of said agreement is grounds for civil damages?\n\nI'm not swiging for the corporations on this one, but could the discovery process shine light on exactly what they were looking for, or would it just be covered up under the same cloak-and-dagger bullshit we've come to know and detest?"

(47:15)\n\nAnd say, \"The truth is from your Lord, so whoever wills - let him believe; and whoever wills - let him disbelieve.\" Indeed, We have prepared for the wrongdoers a fire whose walls will surround them. And if they call for relief, they will be relieved with water like murky oil, which scalds [their] faces. Wretched is the drink, and evil is the resting place.

"the brits should have left germany alone? uh did you ever here of the term \"appeasement\"?? that is what the brits and the allies did? obviously it didn't work when germany decided to invade Poland with its massive army. What was Britain and France supposed to do? first of all they had agreements in protecting each other and second of all, your saying it is Poland's fault for fighting back and Europe should have just accepted Hitler destroying everything? Got to be one of the most ignorant things I have ever seen on reddit. \n\nPersonally I say bomb the fuck out of the middle east and try your best to get as many innocent people out of there. but this isn't a perfect world, and things are not that simple. However, one of these days the terrorists are going to finally go to far, and someone like Israel is going to press the button and blow whatever country to kingdom come with no mercy. that is the reality of where we are headed, as there is no way to weed out who is innocent who is a terrorist, the job is extremely difficult which is why lots of people are dying. \n"

"It's not that I disagree with you. I held the same views that I am debating with you right now. I'm not arguing about how things are, I am trying to figure out how to make them better. \n\n\nWe are of arguably less consequence in the universe than ants. It doesn't mean that we shouldn't try to minimize our own suffering as a whole. \n\n\nI don't think that we need increased regulations. We need decreased regulations, and total open source-esque transparency. That would allow us all to self police much more effectively, and reduce the ability to engage in unfair practices. Discussing your wages with fellow employees shouldn't be a fire worthy offense as it commonly is. \n\n\nI also think that the patent is an anachronistic concept that needs to be reexamined and modified. Manufacturing and development has changed. The ability to rapidly prototype and produce a product has reduced the initial investment in innovation to the point where the protections designed to stimulate economic growth through innovation are actively hampering the progress that they are designed to improve.\n\n\nThe system has to adapt to new realities just as much as anything else. \n\n\n\nI am thoroughly enjoying this civil debate with you, it's a refreshing change of pace. Thank you."

"When people bring up joking and religion, people compare Christianity and Islam as if they're the same thing. They. Are. Not. They're religions, but their importance in societies in which they are dominant is radically different. Before nationalism, the idea of nationhood, all of that, there was only *religion*. People identified by *religion*. This is where Islam is. If you get an influential figure and they say about Americans; \"Yeah, you guys are all fucking stupid. I hope your soldiers step on an IED over there in Afghanistan, it's all you imperialistic fucks deserve\" - this is guaranteed to piss off Americans, except a few who have some really thick skin. \n\nThis is what you do when you mock Islam. It's like calling a black person a nigger. They identify themselves as *black*. It is what they are. They were born that way, raised that way, they *live* that way. If you tell them to go back working in the cotton fields where they belong, you, again, get a really angry reaction from black people. \n\nProgressive, Westernized Muslims don't care if Islam is made fun of. That's because they're *Westernized*. The society they are a part of does not place emphasis on religion as a core personal identifier. In non-Western - or \"core\" Islamic - countries, Islam is to them what being American is to you, or being black is to Obama, or *whatever*. \n\nI'm all for free speech. I don't care if people are offended, and I don't believe in censorship in the slightest, but acting as if making fun of Christianity and making fun of Islam is the same thing just shows a fundamental lack of comprehension of the mindset behind those people you are offending.\n\nIf you wanna look at people shitting on Islam, Omid Djalili is a funny guy and he does it fearlessly. How many white men do you see go on stage and take the piss out of black people? *Very* few. How many blacks do you see go on stage and rip on black people? A lot. People are acting as if this is unique to Islam, but the kinds of \"jokes\" people want to make are the insanely bigoted or offensive ones(The sad and typical \"Muslim blowing up\" joke is like the black man being a criminal joke - it's funny but if you're not one of them you're going to start pissing people off), come up with a tasteful joke about Islam and you wont draw attention to yourself."

You don't Necessarily have to immediately know what the problem is or what's causing it, anthropogenic etc, in order to treat the symptoms. I strongly dislike the idea of artificial clouds and other bandaid, potentially problematic in inforseeable ways, ideas for remediating the situation. However, it IS a fact that if it looked like we were getting into a wipeout situation, that second-class engineering solutions could temporarily help, or even save us. We may end up deploying several of them. It does seem like ceasing to burn shit ASAP is still the best short term plan. You could offset a lot of farting cows with that."

"A lot of people think the doctrine of \"Karma\" means bad people will be punished by the universe.\n\nIt doesn't mean that. It's just a way of ignoring the suffering of innocent people. It's an ancient mental trick used to hold one's conscience at bay, while others around you go to bed hungry, their stomachs tied up in knots as they listen to their starving children cry themselves to sleep.

"Toyotas have computer-controlled throttles as seen in the unintended acceleration incidents a while back.

Something higher-end like the Mercedes in that crash could have such a system as well.\n\nBut it doesn't really matter if the brakes are computer-controlled or not, as long as the throttle, shifter, and ignition are.  Wide-open throttle until the gas runs out will overheat your breaks if you don't deal with it the right way, and then you can't stop.  You'd also get sparking coming from the brakes, as was seen on Hastings' car according to witnesses."

"The bishop is clueless. The banks are not to blame, governments are. The banks only operate under the strict rules and regulations of the central bank - which is government run with government rules. If the government allows slavery nobody should be surprised to see slave owners appearing. The problem is that the government just can't change the rules of the game now. The banks are an integral part in their scheme to enable perpetual deficit spending and indirect monetization of debt to facilitate for this. Without the banks as a team player in their big scheme they would be forced to outright monitize debt / print money in a Zimbabwe style. The banks provide them with alibi and they have to pay the banks for this service. The bishop are blaming the wrong people for the wrong reason. Nothing will change as politicians are addicted to overspending. "

"There are dozens of examples of Muslims in non-backward countries who act like inbred, insane savages. \n\nThe Innocence of Muslims is but one such example. \n\nA study came out earlier this month, showing Muslims in Europe hold very strong fundamentalist views:\n\nhttp://www.wzb.eu/en/press-release/islamic-fundamentalism-is-widely-spread\n\nNeed I go on?

"have you ever actually read the Koran? it is a pretty extreme book. There is a reason the middle east has been like this for thousands of years, Islam is a very strict, unforgiving, and brutal religion. Ridding the world of the infidels, etc. do not exactly encourage peace. Yes millions of muslims are peaceful, in fact I would even say 90% are some of the most peaceful, loving people but it is those 10% who control religion, the mosques, society, etc., just like the princes and families in Saudi Arabia who enforce Sharia Law, that continue to make it such a brutal religion. It is never going to change, because those people are always going to be in control, and being in control means everything to them."

"&gt; And not just pacific, it will spread..it is spreading right now\n\nI know. But there are new technologies that exist called [nuclear transmutation](http://www.coldfusionnow.org/navy-lenr-patent-granted-transmutes-radioactive-waste/) where radioactive wastes can be converted into less dangerous elements with less half-lives or even none. This would take money and the hard part is where is the energy going to come from for this alchemical conversion of radioactive isotopes. Energy itself is the challenge to clean up nuclear pollution. But we must at least face the problem head on and start to tackle the challenges.\n\nCheck out biological transmutation, that even some living things have this inexplicable ability to transmute certain elements. So, nuclear transmutation is a possible solution. But it has to be an international effort to find the solution. And the first part is actually acknowledging the problem, which is so difficult to do on reddit and in people in general, but we are quickly getting there I believe. Time is essential because the more radiation spreads the deeper into the food chain it gets and cleaning up gets harder."

"To people complaining that the comments are in support of Putin's declaration but anti-NSA/PATRIOT Act stuff: \n\nThe biggest difference between the former Soviet Union and the Russian Federation is the USSR's involvement in global geopolitics during the Cold War. Russian foreign policy has been, in contrast, heavily restricted to Eastern Europe and the former Soviet bloc. Putin doesn't pretend Russia is the world police; he isn't sending troops to every humanitarian crisis or dictator or uprising. He is concerned with what's happening in his own backyard with only a few exceptions (Syria).\n\nThe US, in contrast, has backed itself into a corner with Kosovo, Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, and almost Syria, as well as a bunch of UN peacekeeping initiatives in Africa, and stuff like humanitarian missions to Haiti, the Phillipines, etc. Whether intentionally or not, in the last 20 years after the end of the Cold War they've begun exporting the 'world police' image we see so often. This is not to say that that is entirely effective; as the inaction of the UN shows, the US has very little power against other major non-allied states (Russia, China) or allies of said states (North Korea, Syria). Nevertheless they have the reputation of leading NATO's charge into dictatorships, civil wars and genocides.\n\nMy point is thus: because the US, whether rightfully or not, has gained the reputation as a 'defender of freedom and enforcer of human rights worldwide,' their domestic anti-terror policies are criticised for going against this image. Putin, on the other hand, never pretended to give a fuck about despots in other countries or human rights (in either Russia or abroad to be perfectly honest) or genocides or anything. Even if the Obama Admistration's anti-terror policies were exactly equal to those of Vladimir Putin's, only one of those parties cultivated an image that purported to be staunchly against such violations of liberty, an image that brought down the very governments that enacted laws like they did."

"I'm gonna post the same thing I said to the top comment. When people bring up joking and religion, people compare Christianity and Islam as if they're the same thing. They. Are. Not. They're religions, but their importance in societies in which they are dominant is radically different. Before nationalism, the idea of nationhood, all of that, there was only *religion*. People identified by *religion*. This is where Islam is. If you get an influential figure and they say about Americans; \"Yeah, you guys are all fucking stupid. I hope your soldiers step on an IED over there in Afghanistan, it's all you imperialistic fucks deserve\" - this is guaranteed to piss off Americans, except a few who have some really thick skin. \n\nThis is what you do when you mock Islam. It's like calling a black person a nigger. They identify themselves as *black*. It is what they are. They were born that way, raised that way, they *live* that way. If you tell them to go back working in the cotton fields where they belong, you, again, get a really angry reaction from black people. \n\nProgressive, Westernized Muslims don't care if Islam is made fun of. That's because they're *Westernized*. The society they are a part of does not place emphasis on religion as a core personal identifier. In non-Western - or \"core\" Islamic - countries, Islam is to them what being American is to you, or being black is to Obama, or *whatever*. \n\nI'm all for free speech. I don't care if people are offended, and I don't believe in censorship in the slightest, but acting as if making fun of Christianity and making fun of Islam is the same thing just shows a fundamental lack of comprehension of the mindset behind those people you are offending.\n\nIf you wanna look at people shitting on Islam, Omid Djalili is a funny guy and he does it fearlessly. How many white men do you see go on stage and take the piss out of black people? *Very* few. How many blacks do you see go on stage and rip on black people? A lot. People are acting as if this is unique to Islam, but the kinds of \"jokes\" people want to make are the insanely bigoted or offensive ones(The sad and typical \"Muslim blowing up\" joke is like the black man being a criminal joke - it's funny but if you're not one of them you're going to start pissing people off), come up with a tasteful joke about Islam and you wont draw attention to yourself."

"&gt;The other group came in illegally, and from a different fucking continent. \n\n\"During the Mandate, the Yishuv or Jewish community in Palestine, grew from one-sixth to almost one-third of the population.

However, if I understood it correctly, future plans and/or Israel changed it so that they could get rid of most Muslims. That is wrong. Those who lived inside current Israel originally, should have been allowed to live there.\n\n&gt;If they sit on occupied land, how can they complain they are getting blown up?\n\nAre you implying it is somehow ok to murder civilians even if they are \"occupiers\"?\n\nI'm not taking Israel's side here, as you can see I'm still learning the Israel/Palestine situation and history here.\n\nI am however taking the side that it is never ok murder unarmed civilians."

Backward would definitely solve the problem.  Reduce us back to a few 10s of millions, and live sustainably, and these problems wouldn't exist.\n\nBut that's unconscionable to us.  So forward it is.\n\nBut assuming that we're going to out-pace our destruction with our technology is only speculative.  We don't fully understand what the universe allows and doesn't allow.  We'd like to believe we'll eventually blast off the Earth in some Star Trek warp-ship and colonize 100 other planets, but it's quite possible that it's not possible, not because we're not creative or clever enough, but because the fundamentals laws of the universe don't allow it.\n\nIt's also a belief if it is possible, that it will be us doing it, but we aren't in any way compatible with deep space travel.  We send robots to Mars, just a interstellar block away, because it's so difficult to sustain our life there.  It might be the case our role in the grand scheme is to create a life-form superior to ourselves, and give it a chance to seed the galaxy.\n\nPerhaps we're just another in a long line of bright apes that have to fall by the wayside to make room for something more powerful and more intelligent than ourselves.\n\nTime will tell, but humans by and large aren't capable of thinking in that manner.  We're not hive-insects, we live for ourselves not for the species.  We'll trade the common good for the individual benefit at every turn.

"Well sometimes that's because the article doesn't bring too much new information. And as an avid reader of ____ topic it's pretty easy to jump to the comments to see if any experts have weighed in or if this discussion is a significant departure from the last one. \n\nWith development stuff I'm constantly stuffing the articles in saved-links but the discussions are incredibly substantive. So many takes on various routes of doing the same thing and you get to learn why people argue for their method (e.g. a tiny personal website or single owner, a web app, and a large corporate site all comparing SASS, LESS, SCSS etc.). \n\nIn the case of NSA developing a new story. The top comment at the moment tries to downplay the article by saying, \"physical access makes the point of this shit almost irrelevant\". Hack into a piece of hardware that usually gets jailbroken a day or two after major patches means there's exploits all over the place. They aren't just loading custom app stores though, they are tracking the most private shit and activating shit to spy on you every waking hour. The part where they admit to rerouting shipments IS a big deal. It means they can essentially find a backdoor, load up an entire order of phones and until Apple does a patch or possibly even with a patch NSA has their tool to crucify you should there be a need. \n\nThe fact that they admit to working on remote exploits just means that browser, icloud, Wifi, and bluetooth connections would be at risk. I can't really imagine the NSA ramming exploits through the cell chip and writing files into the device... it'd be easier to just attack the cell towers and servers as they currently do. But these people seem pretty creative so maybe Airdrop spyware could actually be a thing. \n\nBut it's just another straw in the pile at the moment. We know that the NSA has gone overboard. We know they've abused their power and at some point SOMEONE will have to fall on a sword. We know they've endangered the entire US by spying on Allies and creating barriers that weren't there before for Diplomatic relations. We know that billionaires, CEOs, and elected officials basically all the people at the top are VERY uncomfortable with the present situation and we know that all of our texts phone calls, and internet usage are being monitored. This article adds a popular device to the mix, eroding another wall of the excuse that \"this does not affect me\". \n\nWhat we don't know is... what's the end game? I am a public individual. I grew up on the Internet and realized anonymity is good HOWEVER it is not air-tight. There will always be someone somewhere who when motivated will track YOU down and can easily take what YOU said and use it against you(non-internet you). \n\nSo what does the NSA gain from my private versus my public life (online)? I like porn, emoticons, and Vine videos of black people? That just doesn't seem worth it. The stuff that's worth it is already out there in the public. And I am more of a prodigious and thoughtful writer than average. Are they doing all of this giant net stuff only to grasp the 1%? That seems like total overkill. Is it to completely turn public opinion on some random person like some movies? The totally public individuals will have a much harder time being damned, and yet they are probably the ones more worth turning. I really, really just don't see the point in all of this. "

"&gt;If the Qur'an admitted it was a fallible document to be updated with better information if and when the time arose, then Islam would be no more harmful than a cup of tea.\n\nI agree with this. And it's also why I think Islam is a bit of a plague upon the world.\n\nIn Christianity, the New Testament is basically written by a bunch of humans living at the time. This creates the grounds for a lot of simple logic for why, if God has commanded Bob, \"do X unto this man\", to argue that even so, today, one should not do X unto a man. For example, that God wanted Bob to do this but nobody else, and it was impossible for Bob to know God's complete will. Basically a mechanism for progressive humanisation and adaptation of religion.\n\nA number of muslims mock this aspect of Christianity, claiming that it's changed over time, been sullied somehow, uncertain, as opposed to Islam which is unchanging, certain and fixed. Within Islam the view is rather that the Quran is the literal word of Allah, and the simple logic for not following a command just isn't there. Allah was all-knowing -- so why did he write \"you should do X\" if he only intended some people some of the time to do X?\n\nThis is important on a micro level of debate and discussion. If Moderate Mortimer meets Firebrand Fred for debate, each having a group of followers, I should think Islam makes it hard as hell for Mortimer to not look a fool when he argues against a literal interpretation whilst Fred can just read out the letters as they stand."

"Not only that, but if you're the only one standing up against such bad behavior, it's just going to get you killed.  Standing up to terrorism has to be done as an organized endeavor, mainly by the government.  If the government refuses to stand up to it, and in fact simply allows it to happen, then what can you do as an individual?  Nothing really.  That's how it is in many European countries, where they allow Muslims to run around terrorizing people, and do absolutely nothing to stop it in the name of \"diversity\" and \"multiculturalism\".  If those countries were serious, they'd deport all such people, especially anyone who displays signs saying things like \"those who insult Islam shall be beheaded\".\n\n\n"

"&gt;End this? nonono, i like you way to much to end this discussion.\n\nI agree completely. Most people seem to argue circularly, or get frustrated and leave. We can go on forever or until we come to an agreement or pinpoint the exact things that are disagreed upon which we do not have the answer too. \n\n&gt;by bitching, americans relieve their stress with the government\n\nBy bitching, voting, and weakly compromising. Bitching is non-violent protesting though. I think making a change through violence is a weak compromise - citizens run the country, pay for the military; it is ours to amend, we just have to stand up together and demand it. So I would encourage more bitching. People think that is stupid, but they misunderstand what bitching has accomplished, and how little it has truly been utilized in a constitutional democracy. \n\nWith NK, it is one of the biggest dilemmas there could be. If we go to war, millions of innocent Koreans will probably die. If we 'peacefully' overthrow the regime by sanctions, millions of innocent Koreans will die. If we try encouraging a military coup (which I truly think would not take a lot of convincing, given the chance; maybe showing the actual size of North Korea compared with the rest of the world), by dropping leaflets or working underground, we risk going to war. I hate to stoop so low, but with the options given, I think multiple assassinations followed by a supported uprising might be the best bet. But allowing them to further develop WMDs is a threat to the security of the world that should never be allowed. \n\n&gt;Give people education, make em work for it.\n\nAt the wages (if any) given regularly in underprivileged countries, paying for the tuition of one class would take years. So a subsidy of some kind is necessary for practicality, and in that case you could be giving it to them for free, and the outcome could be much more effective. On top of all the ideas I've thrown at you up till now, I'll suggest international labor laws (not by the UN, but by national governments either by denying products for American business which violate the laws, or instating import tariffs that make underpaying and overworking workers impractical). This will keep jobs in a practical place for reasons other than avoiding humanitarian legislation. I'm happy with less accepted exploitation, and Americans love their jerbs. They go crazy for some extra jerbs. \n\nIt boils down much, this disagreement, to a creed of philosophy. Should we care about others, beyond their capacity to help us? The evidence against morals (I realize it is a subjective term and people can make it mean whatever they want; I hate lingering on terminology and I'm sure you know what I mean) focuses on lack of reason to for them. Evidence for them goes from the ridiculous to complicated to assumptions about souls - but there is more I am convinced. \n\nAsking an atheist why they aren't an asshole, I find empathy to be a frequent response. Empathy is a phenomenon I'm convinced has come about in humans for a reason. And even if our intelligence can be supposed to circumnavigate that impulse, it exists. It also, mind you is distorted to not apply to gay people, or Africans, or have any limits in consciousness, more likely. I say that more likely, because it seems less likely for young children to be so affectionate towards animals, especially cats and dogs, pandas and such. If you see a video of a person getting kicked in the nuts, you feel something. If you heard me, who you've just talked to on the internet, was a victim of Buffalo Bill, you would probably feel bad. Now I don't know to what level, but if you yourself were to perpetrate some heinous crime to an innocent woman or child, you might feel bad. To what degree of diminished empathy constitutes a psychopath, I don't know. How much better you would feel being justified for all of your actions, and knowing you did the best you could for others, I don't know. So \n\n&gt;There's no \"just or unjust\", there's only feeling good about oneselfs deeds, and not doubting em.\n\nbut we seem to have, in youth, and after education, a fairly uniform feeling of justice, even if it can't be defined absolutely. Cultures everywhere have some sense of justice reflecting their empathetic feelings. I don't think it would be such an invention, to care about others, at least it's like a pyramid, just the most practical way to create a tall, sturdy, building, except erected in our psyche instead. \nHowever, if the best you could hope for is to be cared for\n\n&gt;Like a company cares about a shareholder\n\nYou should be very worried. In a business relationship, when your worth is done for, so is the care for you. I wouldn't be comfortable as a shareholder if the majority holders wanted to sell a booming business because of a deal they cut with others. It would be quite economical for them, however, to get what they can in spite of myself. Likewise, I wouldn't feel comfortable as a citizen when the establishment no longer needs me to defend its interests, when the military can be run without a mass of citizens. So as these remote control airplanes are perfected, as machines can operate the factory jobs we were once needed for, I think a united interest in convincing people to work together for each other is in our best interest, all morals aside. \n\nBut the explanation that I like most comes from you and Cicero:\n\nLiving is an art to\n&gt;survive to eat and fuck\n\nPhilosophy is the art of living well. \n\nNatural processes, and whatever we cause, are another thing difficult to distinguish, which leads to confusion. Simply the fact we can potentially manipulate our DNA to improve ourselves illustrates that evolution does not apply the same to us. Rhinos being shot with rifles does not tell me they are unfit to live and should therefore die. It tells me they have something we want for no good reason. If I am wrong, that we should actively try to save them, than following that, all forms of life we find beautiful will, and should, be erased. \n\nIt doesn't settle well, I don't know where happiness comes from - but I am comfortable feeling justified (or closer to being justified, more accurately), it is like my natural habitat I feel, and beauty helps too, I want beauty, like justice, to thrive, not be taken by selfishness and exploitation, it doesn't feel natural to me, the degree it has taken. \n\nI think I have gone through all three messages, almost. \n\nOCW was an attempt, and actually had/has branches in many cities. Olympia, Washington, is an obscure one I noticed. Of course they didn't have enough momentum, because as we agree, Americans are kept too fat to complain enough. The most materially stuffed population, with one of the most consolidated establishments. A care for others is the only way these fat egos will protest for others en masse. \n\nAmerica sure has risen to the top. It's a lot of responsibility, exceptional responsibility for Americans to carry; it, to me, is a shame American Exceptionalism carries no spirit of duty. \n\nCulture is too diverse in America for it too be a practical factor to target for a tipping point, very few people actually believe in politicians, and democratic politics as an option, as well. The factor I think that will make the difference is individuals. All real progress, as a good thing, has been a matter of individuals. \n"

"I know right?\n\nAnd it is not just on the Mars Rover that this Israeli invented cryo-cooler has been used but 4 other NASA space probes including to the planet Mercury and Comet probes. \n\nChina has excellent technology of this type of its own design. Several Chinese Universities have research laboratories devoted to this exact area of engineering, and Chinese scientists publish papers on Chinese designs for cryo-coolers in scientific journals all the time. So the question is why would China need this particular Israeli device when the Chinese have their own as good or better?\n\nI think probably China wanted this Israeli device for their recently massively expanding non-military civilian space program.  Aerospace engineers hate launching into space electronic components without a proven track record of successful previous space flight. It de-risks the project if the components have all been in space on previous missions and are proven to work in that harsh environment where repairs in the field  are impossible.\n\nInstead of embargoing all western technology from China's space program, and for example cutting them out of the International Space Station it is time the West and Russia start cooperating with China. Space exploration is so expensive the world can't afford to be duplicating efforts. The Chinese have huge amounts of money and engineering capabilities and we should let them join the West and russia and work with them as a member of the team, for the benefit of all mankind.\n\n\n\n"

"Christianity has a long and bloody history. But it's also about 600 years older than Islam. Crusades, inquisitions, witch trials, you name it.

The Huguenots, a Protestant group, were persecuted horribly by the Catholics in France and were massacred in the tens of thousands. \n\nPeople have killed in the name of religion for as long as it has been around. The abrahamic religions are all inherently violent, especially when interpreted literally, word for word. \n\nI do think, however, that Islam is especially violent. I'll be honest in that I don't know a whole lot about Judaism, but with Christianity I know that Jesus wasn't a warrior. Muhammad was a religious, military and political leader. He used violence in order to increase his power and spread his religion. I don't buy that bs about it being a religion of peace. Maybe peace through violence. That's not to say that there aren't peaceful, non-violent Muslims out there. I'm sure there are. But that doesn't change the fact that their religion was both born out of and spread by violence."

"The laws in Japan are a bit grey and here's how they get around it:\n\n\"Article 3 of the Anti-Prostitution Law (売春防止法 Baishun Bōshi Hō) of 1956 states that \"No person may either do prostitution or become the customer of it,\" but no judicial penalty is defined for this act. Instead, the following are prohibited on pain of penalty: soliciting for purposes of prostitution, procuring a person for prostitution, coercing a person into prostitution, receiving compensation from the prostitution of others, inducing a person to be a prostitute by paying an \"advance,\" concluding a contract for making a person a prostitute, furnishing a place for prostitution, engaging in the business of making a person a prostitute, and the furnishing of funds for prostitution. The definition of prostitution is strictly limited to coitus. This means sale of numerous acts such as oral sex, anal sex, mammary intercourse and other non-coital sex acts are legal. The Businesses Affecting Public Morals Regulation Law of 1948 (風俗営業取締法 Fūzoku Eigyō Torishimari Hō), amended in 1985 and 1999, regulates these businesses.\"\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution_in_Japan"
"You have to judge groups based on their behavior, and based on how many people in each group display such behavior.\n\nWBC is a pretty dumb comparison, because there's literally only a handful of people in that church.  You can't judge a religion of over 1 billion followers based on the actions of 10 of those followers, while the other 999,999,990 of them say those 10 people suck.\n\nIf you want to say something bad about Christians, you'll have to find something that a large percentage of those 1B people are guilty of.  I'm actually not sure what that would be, honestly; different groups of Christians are guilty of stupid things, but I can't think of one single thing that a majority of them are.  Catholics, for instance, are guilty of some stupid things like being anti-contraception, but Catholics are not representative of all Christians, and AFAIK are not a majority.  So if you want to criticize Catholics for that, that's fair game.  American Evangelicals, for instance, are guilty of lots of stupid things, like denying evolution theory and global warming and pushing Creationism, but again, Americans are not the majority of Christians, and even in America, Evangelicals are probably not a majority (probably around 1/3 of Christians here, with another 1/3 being Catholics, and another 1/3 being mainline Protestants), so you can't judge all Christians worldwide based on the actions of a minority of Christians in America.\n\nWith Muslims, while I can't say what a clear majority of them stand for or against, we have seen very large numbers of them displaying very bad behavior: millions marched in the streets when the Danish cartoon flap happened several years ago, for instance, demanding the cartoonists be executed.  There's many other instances where very large groups of them have stood for very barbaric things like this."

If they then say, ‘Come, let us worship other gods’—gods you have not known before— do not listen to them. The Lord your God is testing you to see if you truly love him with all your heart and soul. Serve only the Lord your God and fear him alone. Obey his commands, listen to his voice, and cling to him. The false prophets or visionaries who try to lead you astray must be put to death, for they encourage rebellion against the Lord your God, who redeemed you from slavery and brought you out of the land of Egypt. Since they try to lead you astray from the way the Lord your God commanded you to live, you must put them to death. In this way you will purge the evil from among you.\n\n---\n\n&gt;“Suppose someone secretly entices you—even your brother, your son or daughter, your beloved wife, or your closest friend—and says, ‘Let us go worship other gods’—gods that neither you nor your ancestors have known. They might suggest that you worship the gods of peoples who live nearby or who come from the ends of the earth. 8 But do not give in or listen. Have no pity, and do not spare or protect them. You must put them to death! Strike the first blow yourself, and then all the people must join in. Stone the guilty ones to death because they have tried to draw you away from the Lord your God, who rescued you from the land of Egypt, the place of slavery. Then all Israel will hear about it and be afraid, and no one will act so wickedly again. \n\n---\n\n&gt;“When you begin living in the towns the Lord your God is giving you, you may hear that scoundrels among you are leading their fellow citizens astray by saying, ‘Let us go worship other gods’—gods you have not known before. In such cases, you must examine the facts carefully. If you find that the report is true and such a detestable act has been committed among you, you must attack that town and completely destroy all its inhabitants, as well as all the livestock. Then you must pile all the plunder in the middle of the open square and burn it. Burn the entire town as a burnt offering to the Lord your God. That town must remain a ruin forever; it may never be rebuilt. Keep none of the plunder that has been set apart for destruction. Then the Lord will turn from his fierce anger and be merciful to you. He will have compassion on you and make you a large nation, just as he swore to your ancestors.\n\n---\n\nOops! I suppose that's actually Deuteronomy 13:1-17, isn't it?  \nMy bad, hope I didn't undermine your point, or anything. "

"&gt;&gt; A group of wealthy investors wanted to be able to predict the outcome of a horse race. So they hired a group of biologists, a group of statisticians, and a group of physicists. Each group was given a year to research the issue. After one year, the groups all reported to the investors. The biologists said that they could genetically engineer an unbeatable racehorse, but it would take 200 years and $100bn. The statisticians reported next. They said that they could predict the outcome of any race, at a cost of $100m per race, and they would only be right 10% of the time. Finally, the physicists reported that they could also predict the outcome of any race, and that their process was cheap and simple. The investors listened eagerly to this proposal. The head physicist reported, \"We have made several simplifying assumptions: first, let each horse be a perfect rolling sphere… \"\n\n&gt; This is really the joke form of ***\"all models are wrong, some models are useful\"*** and also sums up the sort of physics confidence that they can solve problems (ie, by making the model solvable).\n&gt; Ewan Birney, associate director, European Bioinformatics Institute\n\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/dec/29/scientists-favourite-jokes"

"&gt; just diminishing returns on performance/cost ratio\n\nIt is not a straight line. For example, electronics that monitors health &amp; operation of a system &amp; runs diagnostics, can reduce maintenance cost &amp; burden tremendously.  (eg on f-35). Even better monitoring of engine or flight performance can be used to improve fuel efficiency (eg [This engine program(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_Versatile_Engine_Technology)) and reliability/mean time between overhauls / life . \nEven having weapons interface run by electronics/software may mean that it is easier to add (qualify) a new weapon or to send commands to it. In the past, this was often dealt with simply by not adding different weapons capabilities. \n\nAlso, improved avionics can improve life of a single plane or a single platform, thus allowing for fewer purchases of a plane or for less frequent development of a new plane.\n\nCost is funny. Amortizing development cost over many planes/systems, and over time (using old paid for air-frames and systems) helps hugely. \nCost of losing a plane/pilot is also high.\nAnd in some cases it isn't about the performance-cost ratio but straight performance. \nQuestion is - how much performance is too much. and is the cost tradeoff for that %age of cases worth it in our current milieu. Also, even if you get a 'million performance' (tough to measure) thereby improving performance/cost, do you really need a million performance ?\n\nA singe airplane today  can deliver a precision strike that it may have taken 1000+ WW2 bombers to achieve, (with fewer collateral damage, less pension/training etc). eg - [The peenemunde strike]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Hydra_(1943\\)).What's the premium on that ?\n\nLimiting performance limits cost. \n\nOne point is that improved avionics add tremendously to the capabilities. But  in most cases, the potential is traded off for greater complexity/performance rather than cost. there is a development cost and also,\n\n&gt; UAV make more sense with what you said in mind. Less expensive both in terms of human cost and financial,\n\nUAVs have a place. But it's not a straight re-place. Trying to add similar warfighting/strike capabilities leads to large complex, costly UAVs. They have large sensor and communication needs, which are quite susceptible to failure/jamming (adds to avionics). \nAnd there's benefit in having a trained sensor (eyeball mark 1) along with having the pilot on the aircraft to manage all the inputs, interpret them and make the decisions right there. (especially since there are limits to sensors and communications, sometimes)\nUAVs clearly score on range/persistence and on ability to provide UAVS which are smaller, cheaper, more limited package. (though loss of these is also expensive)\n  \nThey will definitely be more UAVs of all kinds and with differing levels of human crew involvement."

But the fact remains that a majority of the Muslim world is still set off by words or images, which really, really fucking fire them up, sometimes driving them to perpetrate massive massive property damage (i.e. rioting) or to even kill people as a reaction. Even without the jokes or criticism, Muslims are still killing Muslims daily across the Muslim world because one is Shia and one is Sunni, or one of the smaller sects.\n\nIt's a bit unfair to compare race to religion when it comes to comedy. Yeah, white people don't really rip into black people on stage. But Religion, for the most part, transcends race. Anyway, none of that really should matter because it is just comedy and pretty much every race, ethnicity, gender, religion and sexual orientation get shit on. Yeah, some comics go further than others but that's just the way it is. "

"&gt; Thats how cities like London and Berlin are now only around 55% native\n\nDepends how you define \"native\", really.\n\nWhilst it's true that *only* 44.9% of Londoners are \"**White** British\" nearly 2/3 of the population of London as a whole are British (63%), and fewer than 1/4 of the population are from outside Europe (and people within the EU have the right of free movement).\n\n\nAs for Berlin:\n\n[\"National and international migrations into the city have a long history. In December 2010, 457,806 residents \\(13.5 percent of the population\\) were of foreign nationality from 190 countries\"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Berlin)\n\n\nSo you're definitely wrong about Berlin, and wrong about London unless you're classifying those who are British but not white as not native."
"Especially when you're raised in a culture that's permeated in it. It's easy to say in the US where even here, it can be hard to escape your religious upbringing depending on what it is.

"&gt; If members of a religion allow their fringe groups to say and do hate filled things they have no right to lecture anyone on anything.\n\nA religion is not a cohesive entity, and there's no reason to think that its different segments have any real influence on what the other ones do.\n\nSay I'm a guy from Nusquamistan who has never met a citizen of the USA but believes that they're a bunch of stupid fat assholes. Say I make my opinions known far and wide. Mr. Bloggs from Austin challenges me, saying that Americans are nice people and what I'm saying is untruthful. I can then point at any number of people who are stupid, fat,  and assholes, and who by chance happen to be americans. \"Look at these people\", I can say. \"How am I supposed to think Americans are good people when people like this are all over the place?\"\n\nYou hopefully see that this is totally unfair; surely these people are not representative of the USA as a whole and Mr. Bloggs, who has been surrounded by Americans his whole life, knows that on average, they're fine folks that you can rely on. And it's totally unreasonable to think that all their reputations are stained by the fact that some idiots exist somewhere.\n\nBut your argument about muslims here is the same as the argument about people from the USA that is made by the gentleman from Nusquamistan."

Many of the people who died were Muslims, and a good chunk of those were killed by Christians.  The [second article](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C06E5DF1F3EF937A15751C0A9609C8B63) on the page you link to talks about the 100 people who died in Nigerian riots:   \n  \n&gt;  Dozens of charred, smoldering bodies littered the streets of this bustling commercial center on Thursday after three days of rioting in which **Christian mobs** wielding machetes, clubs and knives set upon their Muslim neighbors.  \n  \n&gt; **Rioters have killed scores of people here, mostly Muslims,** after burning their homes, businesses and mosques in the worst violence yet linked to the caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad first published in a Danish newspaper. The violence in Nigeria began with attacks on Christians in the northern part of the country last week by Muslims infuriated over the cartoons.   \n  \nThe Christian attacks happened after Muslim attacks, which were a part of a larger pattern of sectarian violence in Nigeria.  The article states that Nigeria has a fraying patchwork of 200 different ethnic groups and that \"thousands of others have died in such clashes in the last few years.\"  So maybe, just maybe, the hundred deaths in Nigeria were a result of something more complicated than short term religious outrage.  And if that's the case there, maybe that holds true for the hundred deaths that happened outside Nigeria, too.  \n"

I'm not sure why everyone on this thread doesn't realise that just because some people are all like \"oh nooo we can't joke about Islam because we are afraid of violent retaliation and it's all their fault cause they can't take a joke\" what they really mean is that \"those Islamic people won't laugh at my lazy racist jokes at their expense and those are the only kind of jokes I know how to make about Islam so they are jerks.\" \nFor fuck's sake. You can make jokes about ANYTHING!! Just realise that for comedy to work with certain topics you can't be lazy and pull the same shitty predictable route.

"I know this will be buried but I urge anyone who reads this to upvote if you found it informative so we can spread knowledge instead of ignorance. \n\n\nI'm a Muslim, and I think Muslim's need to chill out. Yes, Prophet Muhammad is very dear to us and it hurts and angers us to hear him mocked and insulted. I understand that it's human nature to try and protect something which you love, and to use violence to dissuade others from harming it again. But a main tenet of Islam is to act directly opposite of your human nature, to curb your ego and your animal instincts. \n\n\nRetaliating against verbal abuse with more verbal abuse is unseemly, and retaliating with violence is outright inhuman and goes completely against the teachings of Islam. Before Islam could get a grip hold in Mecca, the Prophet was mocked, slandered, insulted and sometimes even physically attacked. Did he retaliate with verbal abuse? Did he retaliate with violence? NO! It was at these times that a one of his most important characteristics, *patience* came into play. The Prophet of Islam, **Allah's messenger on Earth**, *was mocked by his own uncles and his only retaliation was to pray in their names so they may find guidance.*\n\n\n**•** *\"And have patience with what they say, and leave them with dignity.\"* [**Quran, 73:10**](http://www.quran.com/73/10)\n\n\n**•***\"You will certainly hear much abuse from the followers of previous books and from the idol-worshipping people. And if you are patient and keep your duty -- this is surely a matter of great resolution\"* [**Quran, 3:186**](http://www.quran.com/3/186) \n\n\n**•***\"So be patient over what they say and exalt [ Allah ] with praise of your Lord before the rising of the sun and before its setting:...\"* [**Qur'an, 20:130**](http://www.quran.com/20/130) and [**50:39**](http://www.quran.com/50/39)\n\n\n**•***\"And if you invite them to guidance, they hear not; and thou seest them looking towards thee, yet they see not. Hold fast to forgiveness and enjoin goodness and turn away from the ignorant.\"* [**Qur'an, 7:198-199**](http://www.quran.com/7/198-199)\n\n\n\n**•**The Muslim who mixes with the people and bears patiently their hurtful words, is better than one who does not mix with people and does not show patience under their abuse.\" *This is a hadith from Mishkat al-Masabih,* \n\n\n**•**\"The Messenger of Allah and his Companions used to forgive the idolators and the followers of previous books, as Allah had commanded them, and they used to show patience on hearing hurtful word\" *This is a Hadith from Bukhari.*\n\n\n\n**•**\"Once when the Holy Prophet divided some wealth among his followers, one man accused him to his face of being unfair and told him: \"Fear God, O Muhammad\". After the man had left, the following conversation took place between Khalid ibn Walid and the Holy Prophet:\n\nKhalid: \"Shall I strike off his neck?\"\n\nHoly Prophet: \"No, perhaps he is a man who says prayers.\"\n\nKhalid: \"There are many people who pray, but what they say is not what is in their hearts.\"\n\nHoly Prophet: **\"I have not been commanded by God to cut open people's chests to see what is inside their hearts.\"** \n(Hadith from Bukhari, Book: Maghazi, ch. 63.)\n\n\n**•**Suhayl Amr was a prominent man among the opponents of Muhammad. He was a skilled public speaker of Quraish tribe, and used  his skill frequently to make speeches against Muhammad. He was captured in the Battle of Badr and brought before Muhammad. Umar Khattab asked permission from Muhammad to pull Suhayl's front teeth out so he couldn't speak against Islam anymore. Muhammad replied  that he certainly would not mutilate anyone, because Allah would mutilate him in retribution, even though he was His Prophet. (This is also a sign of the justice in Islam, even the freaking Prophet of God has to follow His rules or face His wrath) Suhaly embraced Islam six years later. Do you think that would have been the case if Muhammad had retaliated his mockery and insult with violence? [*You can read more stories like this here.*](http://books.google.com/books?id=qMV1OcdBBlsC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false)\n\n\nEveryone can see that Muhammad was a master of patience and of ignoring insults. He practised what he preached in the examples I gave above. If we Muslim's can actually remember and concentrate on the life lived by this man, the Islamic world would not be where it is today. The only reason we're seen as violent and dangerous in the west is because we forget to live like the Prophet lived. \n\n\nI don't like it when people insult Islam of Muhammad, I don't respect what they say and I don't respect them as a person. But I sure as hell respect and recognize their right to speak their goddamn minds, and I like laughing at a joke once or two, even if it's about Islam or Muhammad. And I think he would have done the same.There is a lot more I want to say but English isn't my first language and I'm not very eloquent. I urge others to speak out against ignorance and the spread of wrong information, don't let the mindless masses have their say while you sit quite behind the computer. All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing. Peace to all. "
"&gt; I encourage others to do the same.\n\nTo what end?  Is this a hill you're willing to die on?  Insult someones religion for no other reason other than xenophobia?  Why can't we just respect each other?  Islam is a religion of peace.  You don't see people using the Westboro baptist church as a glowing example of Christianity?  It's absurd.

"There are Christians in the United States that identify as strongly with their religion as non-Western Muslims and they don't react violently when they are mocked.  You are stereotyping when you say that a person's sense of identification with their faith/culture is not as strong in Western nations (sure, it may not be completely pervasive in their society, but you did compare this issue to black people being called niggers).  There are certainly people that retain their sense of culture and identify very strongly with it in the United States and other Western nations.  You are also stereotyping when you say that making fun of Christianity is universally unlike making fun of Islam.  It may be in certain people's eyes, and this is more of a factor than the difference in roles of religion between Muslim and Western nations.\n\nIt comes down to the individual's reaction; that is the only thing that is universal about this issue.  There are plenty of non-violent, non-Western Muslims, but the element of terrorism and violence (from an extremely small minority) directed toward expressions of opinion that criticize the religion separates them from all the groups you mentioned.\n\nInsulting Islam is the same as insulting Christianity, or any other group.  It simply depends on the mindset and reaction of the individual.  Insulting Islam is more likely to incite the wrath of a fundamentalist or terroristic Islam, than insulting Christianity is likely to incite the wrath of a fundamentalist Christian.  The fundamentalist Muslims are more likely to be terrorists and react violently; the element of terrorism is more pervasive and notorious in Islam than any other religion or group that you spoke of.  \n\nThere is a certain breed of fundamentalist Muslim that is simply more violent than any other group of fundamentalists/\"strong core identifiers\" that you listed.  While I agree that Islam and Christianity have different roles in their nations of practice for the most, I completely disagree with you when you say that insulting Islam is somehow different than insulting any other group that strongly identifies with a culture or way of life.  It simply comes down to how strongly the individual feels. Even if that lifestyle doesn't pervade their entire society, they may place it before their nationalism, even if they live in the United States--where they can basically live and identify with any lifestyle or culture they would want to."

"The extreme is probably somewhat worse, but why should that enter into our ideas about the majority?"
"We did happen to kill far more Islamic extremists in response to terrorism than victims of terrorism. I agree to some degree with your sentiment but I don't think these people are playing a long game of attrition. I think they're just religious nutjobs who's book says that those not willing to read the book need to be killed. (It's a fake religion anyway, just a copy of the Jewish and Christian texts, copied from one persons memory with some regional warmongering thrown in)\n\nThe lesson taken from the latest clashes between Islamic extremists and non-Muslims is that if you make your extremist views and actions known, you get hunted down and imprisoned or killed. So not really a fantastic success story for the extremist side (all the major players are now captured or dead).\n\nSo while it is true that changing your actions because of terrorism plays into their hands I believe the lesson to take away from the last decade or so is that passivism and tolerance doesn't work against terrorists. I personally believe that it's a perpetual threat and the way to keep your nation safe is to fight the battle in their home country rather than your own. That it's better to lose soldiers lives than your own civilians. Drone attacks work. Intelligence gathering of extremists works. Killing them when they reveal their location and intentions works. However it's an unending battle. The idea that it will go away or that there's a certain number of extremists to kill and imprison is naive."

"The difference between a country and a faith is that one is a geographic region where many diverse people happen to live, and the other is a guideline for living with strict rules and ideological patterns that millions voluntarily follow. If the religion has an effect on its most hardcore adherents making them violent, angry and completely intolerant of different lifestyles, then there's a problem with the religion. Not to say this is representative of everyone, but I thought I'd throw in a personal anecdote here: That is the reason I left Christianity. When I realized that everyone I knew in the church I was raised in was a Bible-waving homophobic bigot who would rather convert new followers than make the world a better place, I knew the problem was the religion, not a few fringe followers. Everyone who wasn't that way left, as did I when I realized that wasn't the way good people live. Sure, you may know some more tolerant Christians, but the problem is they all call themselves that, so they fall under the same category. They'll either have to formally split into different religions or deal with the reality that other so-called Christians have very different beliefs (and historically this scenario has ended with one or more groups going away, violently or otherwise). In certain hierarchical religions such as Catholicism, Mormonism or Wahhabi Islam the religion definitely is a cohesive entity that values conformation to the group over individuality."

"You know, it's so easy to just tell people not to get angry or be offended, but we are products, whether we like it or not, of Christian culture. And, at it's core, the principal response we are taught when insulted is to 'turn the other cheek' or the more modern version 'don't sink to their level'.  This is not a universal teaching. In many cultures self-respect or honor are the chief concern when insulted. \n\nSouth Park and other Western comedies were born from a desire to criticize the proud and the self-righteous.  But I don't think that these Muslims that get angry are being proud. They genuinely believe that an insult against their religious symbols is an ATTACK. Now, a lot of us would say, no subject is sacred enough that it can't be ridiculed, but I again point to the fact that we are Christian-born. Jesus was mocked. The disciples were mocked. We expect religion to be mocked!"
"What you say is true but it's a separate point. I think the fundamental (sorry) consideration is that white guy making fun of Islam is more akin to walking up to a bunch of black militants and making a remark about watermelon and fried chicken than making fun of Christianity (in the case of a well known figure anyway).\n\nIt is more about group/outsider dynamics, perceived victimisation, identification with the group, perceived legitimacy of violence etc. than any philosophical/ religious belief. The parent comment was looking at it as a dynamic more than a question of the validity of the content of those dynamics. \n\nThere's a place for challenging ideas but it's pointless if the only result is that you'll be physically attacked, there has to be an awareness of the environment that those ideas are sitting in."
"It could be completely innocuous. There was a deal a couple of years ago where bad guys tried to plant a bomb in a laser toner cartridge in a printer.

Because of how you're choosing to present yourself.\n\nStop looking and acting like someone an 18 year old wants to date, if you want to stop dating 18 year olds.  Pay attention to the women your own age and be what they're looking for, if you want them.\n\nThese things are absolutely within your control.

"Well for Berlin, I'm simply going by what on old associate told me the last time we spoke, and as he lives in Weimar now, I'll willingly concede inaccuracy there. \n\nAs for London, I do live there, and I only included white British as being definitively native, even if they hailed from a more celtic Irish or Outer Isles background (never did get the foolish need to partition and poorly treat ourselves). I did not include the naturalised second or third generation descendants of immigrants from the Carribean and former West African Indians or Pakistanis which followed Hinduism, who were fleeing fatal persecution from their respective homes after the Empire collapsed. \n\nWhilst many day to day activities are undisruptive and people get along as well as Londoners can without having an existensial crisis, there are borroughs which have become largely - and in rare cases on certain streets, exclusively - locations where only non-whites live, and it does cause friction. \n\nThe Muslim communities in the North London district of Tower Hamlets for example, have become increasingly hostile, resulting in cases of attacking women because of their clothing, or seeing a man be affectionate with a partner in public. A very small group even claimed they had the divine right to cede from England and become a self-governing theocratic enclave. Nobody takes them seriously, but its tense. "

I asked one of the guys in my department, a practicing Muslim, if he could suggest any songs for me.  He said he could find me a song, but did not know of one that was \"funny.\"  \n\nBeing an atheist myself (not the militant kind, just the mind my own business kind), I think all religions are hogwash (yes, even you Buddhists), but I do feel like Islam needs to take a chill pill.

"The question is, can they move out of this stage? Many can't or won't. Is there something about Islam that demands this sort of fanatical loyalty that you won't find with other religions? Almost certainly. That's why it's so much more dangerous than other religions. It tells the follower how to live their lives intrinsically - how they should be governed, how they should marry, who they can marry, how to wipe their arses, how to eat their food, which foods to eat, what to wear, that you have to go to the middle of the desert once in your life to walk around a big rock whilst throwing smaller rocks at it, to pray 5 times a day... the list goes on and on. Obviously members of a cult are going to feel that is more central to their life and get angrier when they have anyone around them rip down the walls on their fantasy, that doesn't make it any more valid.

"I think the 'sexist' part is that the airline assumes that the couple will share a last name, and societal expectations rest on the woman to change *her* name. It's more of a subtle, implied sexism-- like, you're not meeting our criteria for a married couple because the *wife* refused to change her name, so we can't make this transfer. Nobody is directly saying that of course, but I can understand how 'we won't transfer this because you don't get the married couple benefit if your names are different' might feel like that. People (even if it's not the airline, but perhaps the wife's great-aunt-in-law who's had a few too many over Christmas dinner) might still ask the woman why she didn't change her name, and nobody at all (except perhaps the most ardent and vocal feminist) would ask the husband if this couldn't have been avoided if he had just changed his name. I think it's really that potential-blame for something that should be OK in this modern age that has people up in arms. It's quite odd really, because saying it's sexist implies that it *is* the wife's fault for not changing her name, because no one would expect the husband to, which is in itself sexist.\n\nAssuming that the vouchers will go from the husband to the wife is absolutely sexist. If everyone on this thread made both the assumption that vouchers were transferred between genders of married couples at an equal ratio and that the duty of surname changes rested equally upon both parties' shoulders, there would be no sexism debate at all-- merely a question of why this airline is incapable of accepting modern-day marriage practices."

"China and Toxin in food leading to cancer: the problem of long term consequences and whether the Chinese can better deal with it\n\nThere has been an increase in cancer within China which many believe are due to toxins founds in their food. Apparently in provinces like Hunan where about 16% of the country's rice is produced there have been increased activities in mining which has led to increase levels of toxins. These toxins are supposed to be the main cause of rising illness.\n\nIt seems like most of our challenges today are of a similar nature both on a state and on an individual level. Essentially problems that have a direct effect are easy to solve. If there is a fire that leads immeditately to burning then we know to put it out. If we touch something hot we know to retract. As a country if another nation threatens us with war then we mobilize our defences. All these problems are direct and obvious which makes solving them simple between we are equiped with the rational and the procedural rules to respond. But what's harder are things that lurk beneath our vision or happens over the span of years and centuries. \n\nFor the individual I think a healthy lifestyle is exactly so hard because there isn't any benefit for a lot of time to come. When I pack my container of brown rice and chicken I don't seem to be much happier than friends eating a cheeseburger. The effects and benefits are longterm so I will have to put in a dedicated effort while others benefit by not trying. And you know not to mention the possibility that I do everything in vain and somehow find out years later my diet actually caused me harm. \n\nI think this type of disconnection is similar when it comes to environmental challenges at the state level. It's not at all apparent what advantage you get by halting your economy to save a lake or protect some species you've never heard of. As a government you'd feel immense pressures to effect positive change now which involves taking steps to ensure your nation is richer. In this case the provincial leaders in Hunan, China see a direct benefit in expanding mining and yet cannot as easily see the effects on the nations health.\n\nIt's because of this I'm inclined to wonder if maybe a government like China's could better deal with these issues. Ruled for a small group of party members could they see past what otherwise blinds democracies and make decisions that prevent long term diasters? "

"&gt; Sure, you may know some more tolerant Christians, but the problem is they all call themselves that, so they fall under the same category.\n\nI guess this is our major disagreement. I don't think they fall under the same category. You say they should have a formal split, but that's a difficult thing to do when formal structure is mostly absent overall. If a political party (say) has a split, it's going to be formalized, because the entire existence of the party is formalized. But religion often has no apparent structure beyond that of the congregation. If the congregation splits, you'll know, because the congregation is at least somewhat well-defined as an entity. But you want a split at a higher level, and it is not clear what that actually means."
"Actually the Pakistanis have 100 warheads (estimated). Lets say they don't even use nukes at all. \n\nRussia borders MANY Muslim dominated countries.

It is essentially the tactic that the Russians used to beat the Germans in WW2; victory through overwhelming numbers, even if it means HUGE losses. \n\n&gt;Now ask yourself how much Putin cares about the citizens of Russia. Be honest. He'll keep on hitting back until the Muslims are forced to give in.\n\nAgreed; which is why I said that in a hypothetical scenario or in an alternate universe, if this ever was to happen. Russia should expect the majority of their population as dead with pretty much all of their major cities in ruin. \n\nI don't think people understand how sacred of a shrine Mecca is too Muslims.

Hence why he kept making up B.S. excuses and told them they were just being relocated; then he forced them into camps where he would slowly kill them as to not create a scenario where they would all rebel at once. \n\nPissing off 1.5/7th of the total population of earth at once isn't a smart idea. \n\n"

I believe that an intelligent species is the only thing which can address that problem. I have hopes that humans will reach the point where they are more inclined to do good in general, so I'm not in favor of extinction.\n\n&gt; And there would be no global warming, etc. Well, there wouldn't have been any to begin with if humanity was never around. \n\nI don't think global warming is inherently bad.

"He also said that black people in America identify with the color of their skin, much like Americans identify with America, and Muslims with their religion.  If Americans get insulted by a foreign leader, we're not going to attack them for that.  Muslim terrorists seem to be prone to doing that when they are criticized or mocked.\n\nMy point is that the small segment of extreme, terroristic Muslims seem to be more sensitive and prone to violence when their faith is mocked or criticized than any of these other \"fundamentalists\".  There seems to be a SMALL SEGMENT of the Muslim population that is more aggressive about stamping out dissent over their religion than any of these other groups.  Note that I am not talking about the average Muslim in either Middle Eastern or Western nations.\n\nSo, yes, Muslim extremists seem to be more violent than other fundamentalist groups of these other identities.  I stand by my point and I don't think you really understand what I'm saying.  This is essentially about reaction to freedom of press/speech and how Muslims seem to have small population that does not tolerate freedom of speech when it targets them.

"To be fair, Chamberlain tried as hard as he could to prevent a war.  At the time he had no idea what a monster Hitler actually was/would become.  Up until Britain's declaration of war on Germany, Chamberlain was working reach a peaceful settlement in which Germany could annex Danzig.  At this point it is important to understand that Hitler was only annexing former German territories, which had a large population that supported becoming incorporated with Germany.  Hitler thought Chamberlain was bluffing and would not actually defend Poland, so he went ahead and invaded instead of pursuing peace.  It wasn't only Chamberlain that wanted to avoid war; the population of Britain did not want another war.  After Hitler invaded Poland, this sentiment changed of course.  \n\nFunny that everyone gives Chamberlain shit for appeasement, but the US gets a free pass for isolationism.  Hitler had all of western Europe and the US public and government still didn't care.  At least Chamberlain did what he said he would even though he didn't want war."

"So- in your opinion if e.g. a Muslim wanted to drink wine would you admit there's a chance your understanding of the Qur'an is fallible enough that it's wrong in principle to forbid it based on Islam alone?  What about if a Muslim disagreed with a verse in the Qur'an?  Should they have to study the Qur'an harder on the basis that this should eventually lead them to the truth or are they free to reject the verse?\n\nI think what I'm getting at is that yes- it's definitely a good thing that Muslims acknowledge their interpretation may be wrong but is that enough?  Ultimately the remedy for disagreement is further study of the Qu'ran as opposed to having the freedom to consider that better solutions may lie elsewhere.\n"

The US does not have a group or area within its border violently fighting for their own Islamic state, Russia has fought a war of that nature recently (and it's not peaceful yet.) \n\nMore importantly, the US is killing insurgents with drones on the opposite side of the world where they arguably have little in the way of proper jurisdiction to do anything, Russia is doing things within her own borders.

"Edit: The voting got switched around. This post is about the exchange happening here between /u/Zion-Ba-Ion, /u/asongfromthesixties, and /u/kaleety\n\nLook at the first 3 posters in this thread. The first is a person who posts twice a month (could be alternative account). The second person is quite obsessed with calling out anti-semitism, but appears to be the main propaganda account. The 3rd poster is clearly an alternative account. Most likely a vote booster account (one of many). That is the only post that account has made since it was created 8 months ago. \n\nLet's look at the comments themselves. The second person starts the comment off with \"Its true.\" The third person starts their comment off with \"true.\" Strange.\n\nAlso, take a look at the first poster. Look at the phrase \"etc etc.\" The poster who responded to this person also uses this same, rare phrase (without periods or a comma) here: http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1swbyi/on_eve_of_ministerial_debate_haaretz_poll_finds/ce1zo5d\n\nFinally, the third person uses the phrase: \"pro pal arguments.\" Nobody talks like that. It appears to be a poor attempt at making the poster appear to speak differently from the person he is responding to, when in reality, they are all 3 the same person. \n\nAnother odd quality of the first poster is they only have comments in r/worldnews. This must be the /r/worldnews propaganda account. I'll bet there's other accounts just like this dedicated to specific subs. The second poster also seems to stick to /r/worldnews for the most part, and since the 3rd poster never commented before ever, it also only has comments here. "

The South Downs were on my doorstep, and the beach was down the road. I recall frollicking amongst rather annoyed sheep and cattle as I explored the ruins of an Iron Age hillfort. It was great. \n\nLondon by comparison was stern and weathered, where people just quietly went from place to place or stayed indoors brooding. If you had some co-workers or friends from your childhood then all was well, but otherwise it was so easy to slide into loneliness. \n\nA secondary school in Lewisham was a place where one could keep to themselves, and classes were generally full of banter, but even though my form group was more integrated than most, so many other students seemed to just naturally group themselves by race or culture. \n\nMy group of friend at that included a boy from Bermuda, and even he stayed away from the other students with Carribean heritages. They treated him with disdain for reasons he never shared, but it was clear London was a place where the ice breaking had to occur early and swiftly or else you're a reject. \n\nThat feeling of abandonment is so clearly what happened to the immigrants from Pakistan and other Islamic states in the last few decades, and once the derranged Imams reach them, its easy to see why places like Bradford have become shunful and vitriolic towards the rest of the country."

"&gt; So- in your opinion if e.g. a Muslim wanted to drink wine would you admit there's a chance your understanding of the Qur'an is fallible enough that it's wrong in principle to forbid it based on Islam alone?\n\nIn principle, there's no way to be absolutely certain that it prohibits all alcoholic drinks, but that doesn't mean that we shouldn't attempt to interpret it to the best of one's ability and live life according to it (if one chooses to be a Muslim, that is.)\n\n&gt;What about if a Muslim disagreed with a verse in the Qur'an? Should they have to study the Qur'an harder on the basis that this should eventually lead them to the truth or are they free to reject the verse?\n\nhttp://quran.com/3/7\n\n\n&gt;I think what I'm getting at is that yes- it's definitely a good thing that Muslims acknowledge their interpretation may be wrong but is that enough? Ultimately the remedy for disagreement is further study of the Qu'ran as opposed to having the freedom to consider that better solutions may lie elsewhere.\n\nWell, yes, you're right, there's no absolute freedom granted within the framework of interpretations, you're ultimately constrained to the words on the page, but that's the trade-off. If you believe that God *actually* authored the Qur'an, then it doesn't become that much of an issue. The Qur'an doesn't present any moral dilemmas anyway, really, so even then, it's not problematic (unlike the present-day Old Testament.) "

It is a valid comparison and the key distinction is which forms of discrimination you are more comfortable with.\n\nNo.  You have read the Qur'an, why do you cling to the myth that the Qur'an is sexist? I am sure that the folks at /r/islam would be happy to dispel any falsehoods you have heard about Islam and sexism.  In the middle east, too often people point to Islam when the reality is that there is a tremendously long history of patriarchal *culture.*  Make sure that you realize the dividing line between culture in the middle east and Islam, as they can be hard to distinguish.\n\n&gt; I suspect you would recognize the significance of Human Rights violations only when they are being committed against you and your family.\n\nMy argument though is that Islam is not to blame for many of these violations.  Has anyone ever committed atrocities in the name of Islam?  Yes. But just because someone is a sexist and prays 5 times a day does not mean Islam is sexist.  It is a sexist person practicing Islam."

"Russia's policy has been counterproductive in terms of preventing terrorist attacks, though. When Putin did this in 1999, in the Second Chechen War, terrorist acts in Russia increased 400% in 4 years. So appeals to the practicality of brutality are false. The Russian \"experience\" should argue against the same old tactics, not result in a cheering of them.\n\nRussia doing things within its own borders has MUCH more salience as an argument. But it seems a lot of people whose vehemence on the *principle* of human rights, of hatred of the surveillance state, dislike of polices states in general...why do borders affect their judgment so much when their issue is (according to them) basic human rights?\n\nI don't think Putin should allow this horrific murder, this awful terrorism. I don't think the United States should allow these people to gain footholds and reach to the United States. Certain tactics help that mission along for both countries, and for China against it's Western suicide bombers, and for everyone more concerned with modern civilization over medieval regression. \n\nHowever, there is a balance to be struck for democracies or quasi-democracies between the rights of liberty and the preservation of security, and out-of-context quotes by Ben Franklin don't undo that need for a \"gray\" balance outside of the black and white of it. Most countries' governments have gone crazy for security, and that's wrong. It's wrong for the US. It's wrong for Russia. It's wrong for China and everyone else, too.\n\nIf we can all get to a point where we realize that some intelligence measures, some tactics, are necessary...fine.

"Having lived in both in the US and UK for extended periods of time, I think the correct strategy for secularists who care about reason and justice in the US is to ignore Islam, because it has virtually no influence whatsoever, Christianism is a much greater threat as is the nationalist reaction to Islam and Islamism.  In the UK however, there really is a cultural and political danger from Islamism as certain Islamic communities attempt to expand their cultural and political influence, and while there is also a great danger from nationalist reactionaries response to Islamism, Christianism is not so significant in the UK as it is in the US.  For similar reasons I don't see much political motive to make fun of Jains or Unitarians, who overwhelmingly nice people who don't try to deprive anyone of their rights or to impose a theocratic agenda anywhere.  \n\nAs such I think the responsible balance of targets for humor and satire is a bit different in the UK as compared to the US.

It the podcasts it told of a factory in Colombia which had raised the wages and the conditions for its workers too high and so was abandoned by Jockey for cheaper labour in a different country. This is how these things work - it's a profit orientated approach, and both the big corporations, which are aware of the goings on, and the factory owners themselves contribute to the  bad conditions for the workers by making the choices that they do. \n\n\nhttp://apps.npr.org/tshirt/"

Survivors of sunken rafts leaving North African coasts to make for Italy snd France reportedly get told by the crooks that ferry them part way that they would be sailing up the Thames in time for supper. \n\nImmigration has picked-up all across Europe in the last decade, as evident by the increased hostility in Sweden with the Stockholm riots and the veil ban in France. \n\nYet for each incident of mainland repression, Britain remains the stoic and the tolerant, at least as national policy. Some people like myself are inexplicably apathetic towards it all, whilst the rest, not knowing how to radicalise effectively, resorted to thuggery and petty vigilantism, which only disollusioned the middle classes more than dncourage them. \n\nThe answer likely still lies in tolerance, rather than a second lapse into fascism, but the uncooperation from the immigrants themselves are just as much to blame. When they'd rather play victim to criticism for adherence to such a foul religion as their's, they are not yet worthy of respect. Mocking faith has been a long-standing and proud British tradition, ever since the dissollution and later after the reinstatement of the monarchy."

"&gt; And how's the Islamic intellectual world doing right now? \n\nAvicenna, Averroes, Alhazen, Alpharabius, Alkindus, Alberonius, Avempace, al-Ghazali, etc, did just fine, actually. To say that the current state of the Islamic world has more to do with Islam than other causes would equate to forming your thesis on selective historical grounds. If, hypothetically, the Qur'an never existed, (ignoring the principles of Chaos theory), the Islamic world today has no reason to be any better, but probably only worse. Most people in the Islamic world have a nebulous understanding of true Islamic precepts and the Qur'an to begin with anyway (which allows their clergy to exploit their ignorance fiendishly.) \n\n&gt;Are you happy with its progress in science and technology and in philosophy and the arts and music and writing and so on?\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbasid_Caliphate\n\nThe current decline of the Muslim world has more to do with factors beyond Islam rather than factors exclusive to this religious ideology, this \"Islam.\" If this wasn't the case, why would the far more puritanically religious Abbassids have flourished under the very same religion?\n\n&gt; There are very good reasons why Western secularism is currently churning out millions of scientific papers and technological innovations whilst the Muslim world is left behind in the dust\n\nAnd none of those reasons are inherently tied to Islam. The Phillipines or Uganda produce no more technological innovations than Pakistan or Lebanon.\n\n&gt; In Western secularism all ideas can be criticized and knocked off their perch. No exceptions and nothing is held to be infallible. Intellectual freedom must be completely unrestricted or else it just doesn't work.\n\nI agree, but now you've gone and convoluted the discourse because you're asserting that holding some things to be religiously sacrosanct equates to evading intellectual criticism of those precepts. Morality cannot be criticized relative to an objective standard since it evades objectivity, so, it's fairly irrelevant whether or not one holds the moralistic values within the Qur'an to be fallible or infallible. It's not like the Qur'an says that the earth is flat or something and that scientists (within the Muslim world) refuse to contradict that assertion. \n\n"

The problem here arises that Africans were here with the Anglo-Saxon colonists, but they weren't considered \"people\" by the founders. In addition, the United States took a lot of its land from the Spanish which left lots of Spanish colonist and Spanish/Indian mix people.\n\nI think it's best to just consider the United States (being \"American\") as a nationality which groups together many other united ethno-nationalities.

"&gt;Stops any advocacy groups he doesn't like by labeling them foreign agents\n\nLots of Russian NGOs took money from Western nations. I can absolutely guarantee you the Western nations weren't just doing charity when they supported opposition NGOs in Russia. US won't like it if some important US NGO took money from the Russian gov't either. Imagine the uproar if Bush-era Republicans found out that Bush-era Democrats took money from China and planned to install a pseudo-communist system of gov't in the States.

But Russia always had a noticeable homophobic streak since USSR fell apart. Putin merely capitalised on what the population believes in. Russian people are to blame here, not Putin. Arguably his anti-gay measures were the *most* democratic things he did since they were very popular (a decisive plurality of Russians support it)\n\n&gt;Murdered Alexander Litwnienko by a method to publicly show his strength\n\nI don't doubt that Putin ordered deaths at times, but that's unfounded bullshit. Litvinenko blackmailed a lot of Russian oligarchs and he got what any man would have gotten when they fuck with those lawless bastards. Almost all the reporters that go missing or dead in Russia are killed at the hands of oligarchs whose corruption they expose. Problem is, while Putin is not directly behind these deaths, he doesn't exactly try to stop them. \n\n\n\n&gt;Nothing I've linked to is even controversial\n\nYou don't sound like a Russian, but if you were, you would be a pretty ill-informed one. Reading the news won't give you the same perspective as living in the country or especially being a Russian expat looking back at his country. Putin is pretty bad, but so far we don't have much choice. Problem is, of course, is that he is stifling all opposition so we won't have any chance to pick anyone better. Then again, Russia needs *a very strong leader* to rein in all the oligarchs, even at the cost of colluding with them many times. Yeltsin was a pure kleptocracy. Putin at least believes in Russian greatness, he actually cares about the country more than he does about himself, which is a goddamn rare quality in Russians. We don't give a fuck about our country most of the time. At least not enough to do anything about it. I don't live in Russia anymore either. \n\n\n\n"

The atmosphere is extremely complicated and so climate change models are difficult to put together and have them model everything properly. \n\nThe upward trend in temperature is fairly certain, but predictions to 2100 are unlikely to be very correct.\n\nThere are many climate models by the way. They all seem to somewhat agree but there is a large discussion on whether they agree because this is what is occurring or because they're taking common borrowed parts, there are more models so the statistics change, etc. \n\nLong story short, we don't know for sure.\n\n"

"Skeptic here. My 2 cents: While I agree with the sentiment that making fun of Islam is inviting a death sentence, I believe that within reason, certain issues can be poked fun of in Islam. This requires a tasteful sense of humor and cannot involve the targeting of, however easy and tempting it may be, the prophet. It goes without saying that no artist wishes to be constrained in their creativity. But then again an artist can make do with whatever is available. I feel the temptation to go all out anal when making fun of Islam is too damn high, and whoever wishes to do so, aims for the jugular, as is the target for any artist who wants to \"kill it\". Then again there is a spectrum of materials to be used.\n\nIn brief, these are the things you cannot make fun of unless you want to die an unnatural death:\n1. The prophet\n2. The qoran\n\nEverything else is fair game if done in a manner that Muslims will also find funny, eg.:\n1. Rituals that are performed under social pressures \n2. Cultural differences between types of Muslims and how they manifest in society\n\nThis involves knowing the subject well before embarking on comedic quests of founding a funny kingdom.\n\nThe compulsion to appear Muslim is at times greater than the fact that they are Muslims. It's important to note that while they might display a slight but noticeable uneasiness at performing said rituals, they never refute the validity of them in front of kaafirs (99.99% of reddit). \n\nTo me it's about evolution. A sense of tolerating diversity vs a display of cultural uniformity. It's a fine balance that Muslims must have in order to blend. The artist has the creative license to either detonate a nuclear device at the boundary and watch the fallout, or they can gently push the walls and see the response. If positive, push a little harder. Bending vs breaking.\n\nSorry if it seemed like more than two cents. In India 2 cents, is like 1.20 rupees. That's a lot, when you consider 1 bhang goli costs 1 rupee and trips you out for 6 hours. "

"At the same stage in Christianity (1400-1600 years into their faith), we had the roots of Reformation emerging, where people were questioning the generally more rigid interpretations of the Bible that Catholics had and wanted a more \"spiritual\" and \"personal\" relationship with their religion. It was probably the most violent time between Christians in history because of religious beliefs.\n\nUnfortunately, no equivalent to the Reformation of arguing for a more personal relationship between the individual and Allah has emerged from either of the two major sects that Islam has today. This lack of a movement that argues for a more personalized belief system that is more about one's understanding of the tenets of Islam makes it difficult for moderates to fight for an identity that is very much enforced by restrictive and literal interpretations of their beliefs by hard-liners who have political power.\n\nIt bears noting that there is no political infighting between moderate Muslim states and states that harbor hard-line interpretations of Islam, since the moderate states have sizable elements of hard-liners in their political processes, unlike the polarization of the Reformation where few states had sizable populations of their religious opponents."

"Well, that's good that you justify using missiles on innocents by assuming they must be family of terrorists.

"I see you did not answer my question about if you have ever actually been to China. I'll just assume that means the answer is no. You should maybe spend some time talking to actual Chinese people or reading their opinions on the internet before you assume that the average person is brainwashed. Even though their educational system presents a very biased view of the CCP, that does not mean that people have no other means to learn about the government and what is really happening. Not to mention that many people experience the contradictions first hand. If you're trying to say that the majority of Chinese people are brainwashed and have no critical opinions of the CCP, you are just plain wrong, and even a cursory Google search would reveal plenty of dissenting opinions from Chinese citizens. It is ludicrous to assert that most Chinese believe only the things they read from their high school textbooks. \n\n200,000+ protests per year is no small potatoes, even when you consider the large population. What is more striking, is the fact that the number of protests is rising annually, and has been for years. \n\nAs for why a majority of Chinese would rate their satisfaction with the government so high, I can think of a few reasons. First, for better or worse, the CCP is their own. A lot of blood, sweat, and tears were shed to get rid of the emperor and create something led by the people. Second, the concept of face is extremely important in Chinese culture, and people are reluctant to publicly criticize their own country to save face. Third, despite the resulting problems, the CCP has lifted millions out of poverty in record time. Many people are much, much better off now than they were a generation ago, and this is a source of pride and happiness for many. "

"I'm interested in seeing if Russia's relationship with Iran will change at all. Iran, as some sources report (Can't provide them currently, on mobile), sponsors terrorism in Afghanistan and Palestine. Fortunately, Rouhani has softened Iran's rhetoric on fighting Isreal and the US, but I'm curious as to how Russia will respond when US representatives mention Iran's state sponsored terrorism to Putin. Will arms sales to Iran be halted? Will Russia abstain from debate on further sanctions on Iran in the UN? Or does Putin's statement only refer to domestic terrorism?"

"I won't say I agree with you, but some messed up stuff has definitely been done in Russia that hurt civilians.  I can only think of one situation, and I just read about it.  \n\nApparently, in 2002, what is known as the Moscow theater hostage crisis occurred.  Terrorists took nearly 1000 people in what was a few day long hostage situation, and Russian military stepped in to try and take them down.  What many think they did, I guess, was pump weaponized carfentanil (a very, very powerful fentanyl analogue) into the air ducts.  They did kill all the (approximately) 50 Chechen terrorists, according to reports, but they also killed more than 125 civilians with this choice of action.  In their defense, they might not have had many other options. sources: 1. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carfentanil  2. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_theater_hostage_crisis\n\nThis was a pretty off-topic comment I guess.  I think Russia does care for their citizens, and they wouldn't disregard their lives.  However, I guess I can see why you might have said that.  Also, I really do hope he mercilessly crushes these terrorists.\n\nCommence with the down-voting."
"*Clearly*."
"And Russia's attempt at rolling over Chechnya in 1999 resulted in a 400% increase in terrorist acts in Russia from 2000-2004. That spike was only ended via the honey-pot that the US' Iraq War provided, drawing North Caucasus' terrorists away from Russia and toward the Sunni triangle. The Russian counter-terrorist experience is a BAD one. Your argument is like saying that the US has experience fighting wars in the Middle East, so they should invade Iran. BAD experience is an argument AGAINST, not FOR."

The closest source to this is the sensational biography by Jad Adams, but this one is not exactly well-researched, getting some very  basic information wrong, and is also quite biased to boot. Unfortunately, because Gandhi has many fanatical, less-objective detractors among lower-caste/untouchable, Muslim, and right-wing Hindu conservative elements now, that book's claims remain bandied about on the internet (it's the source of the \"but he was a racist!\" claim among others.)

"Well that's just a no win sort of statement. The government could, were there inclination to do so and lawmaker desire, monitor *all* communications for indications of any illegal activities. All they have to do is make a law that all texts be copied into a government database by the service provider, calls recorded, etc. Could probably catch a whole lot of illegal stuff with that sort of setup. Criminals can hardly resist using twitter for their crimes, let alone texts and phone calls. You're saying not disrupting these activities is supporting them by omission because it could theoretically be disrupted. But most of reddit here has been angry about the *accusation* that Uncle Sam is reading their emails and dirty texts or whatever. \n\nSo there's really not a winning situation with what you suggest. Not unless you really love the idea of an incredibly powerful and all-seeing government, which most people wouldn't be thrilled with. "

"&gt; What are you talking about?\n\nA security researcher at Google reported a bug in July 2012 that the appstore did NOT use HTTPS for some user identifiable information.  His report didn't get fixed until [March 2013](http://elie.im/blog/web/apple-finally-turns-https-on-for-the-app-store-fixing-a-lot-of-vulnerabilities/#.UsOkXvRDuuz).  i.e. ~9 months later.  That is *long* time after it was reported to fix an oversight that really should have NEVER existed.  This should have been a major priority to patch, but Apple management didn't consider it that important apparently.   Any user identifiable information particularly customer data about purchases should have always used HTTPS before any public release.\n\n  Bottom line Apple is starting to look more and more like Microsoft of yore not just in market dominance, but showing a shakier reputation on security than Apple used to have.  I'm pretty confidant Apple closed that unintended install using developer certs, but my confidence in Apple is certainly significantly less than it used to be. \n\n&gt;Huh? We're talking about building iPhones in the factory here. Not 100% of users, we're talking about the people trained to build the phones. That's a much smaller group of people.\n\nSmaller group, but again not impossible.  It wouldn't be the first time Apple's contract manufacturer messed up either.  Back in 2006, Apple accidentally shipped ipods that were loaded with some Windows malware.  While I imagine that their QC policies have improved dramatically since then I wouldn't say impossible.  You presume that what the OEM says to put on the device is bit for bit the same 100% of the time.  It is exceedingly rare and most companies QC would catch it before it ever reached the hands of customers, but with so much personal data on iOS devices I wouldn't be surprised if there are malicious organizations in China that would attempt to bribe some relatively lowly paid Foxconn employee to change the image that was getting written to flash memory in the factory."

"&gt;I see you did not answer my question about if you have ever actually been to China. I'll just assume that means the answer is no. You should maybe spend some time talking to actual Chinese people or reading their opinions on the internet before you assume that the average person is brainwashed.\n\nThat's irrelevant. Writings are just as telling as talking to a person. Besides, how do you talk to 1.3 billion people? It's more telling to read their writings on the web, news, as well as other postings and musings. \n\nBesides, you're still ignoring the fact article stated which I initially posted and then posted again after you asked me what brainwashing is. So here it is again. \n\n&gt;&gt;Material used in textbooks exemplifies and glorifies the party, showcasing how it takes care of its people, the way a parent does for a child, and how society should therefore be appreciative and obedient, ready to put self-interest aside when the party asks.\n\n\nBrainwashing is \n\n&gt;Intensive, forcible indoctrination, usually political or religious, aimed at destroying a person's basic convictions and attitudes and replacing them with an **alternative set of fixed beliefs.**\n\nI posted a linked comment showing that 90% of the Chinese interviewed are satisfied with their government, but you still believe they're not brainwashed since there are protests, thus they can't be brainwashed. \n\nTHAT is the example of your brainwashing. \n\n\n&gt; Even though their educational system presents a very biased view of the CCP, that does not mean that people have no other means to learn about the government and what is really happening.

It is ludicrous to assert that most Chinese believe only the things they read from their high school textbooks\n\n\nThis, if true, then, doesn't explain why the 90% of Chinese approve of their government. That falls on you. (One way to deal with that is to discredit a Harvard study that I linked.) \n\n\nThis, too, is an alternative set of belief to one I provided. \n\n\n&gt;200,000+ protests per year is no small potatoes, even when you consider the large population. What is more striking, is the fact that the number of protests is rising annually, and has been for years.\n\n\n200K protests and 130 million unsatisfied people comes to what? That's about 650 people/protests, meaning if 650 people protested ONLY once a year, you will get 200K protests among 130 million people. \n\nThis isn;t much to boot your flawed argument that the people aren't brainwashed when you yourself are. See above. \n\n\n&gt;As for why a majority of Chinese would rate their satisfaction with the government so high, I can think of a few reasons. First, for better or worse, the CCP is their own. A lot of blood, sweat, and tears were shed to get rid of the emperor and create something led by the people. Second, the concept of face is extremely important in Chinese culture, and people are reluctant to publicly criticize their own country to save face. Third, despite the resulting problems, the CCP has lifted millions out of poverty in record time. Many people are much, much better off now than they were a generation ago, and this is a source of pride and happiness for many.\n\nThese, too, are alternatives beliefs you;re using to explain what I said. Go read the definition of what brainwashing is again\n\n\n"

Under their ideology, those slain family members die as mujahideen, the greatest honor imaginable to them--instant paradise. We've seen this same mentality over and over again in regards to mosques; enemy combatants/'terrorists' take positions in mosques, knowing that our soldiers will have to shoot back at them and destroy the mosque. They might die, but the PR nightmare associated with destroying a mosque adds to their cause. They have the same mentality with their family. \n\nI very much believe that all efforts should be taken to avoid collateral damage, but at the end of the day, shit happens.

"Yeah, nice false equivalency. The difference is, our military is a professional organization that actually attempts to mitigate civilian casualties, whereas a terrorist organization SEEKS civilian deaths (different than an enemy combatant who wants to take out military targets alone). That's why we don't bomb the terrorist/combatant when they're in a crowded marketplace. You get them when they're isolated. Unfortunately, it's rarely possible to completely avoid any and all collateral damage, especially because these people actively want civilians to be killed alongside them to create a PR disaster.  "
"Great take on the situation, now where is your solution? The world is a dirty place, and you seem like a person who would rather smack the wrists of the American government then put forth any decent alternative to how we tackle the problem of the global terror threat we face. Comparing the Boston bombings to the situation being discussed is also immature as it is trying to shame Americans into feeling less grief because you don't think that tragedy is near as devastating as those faced by others. Tragedy is tragedy and everyone is sad and hurt by the situation, there are no winners in war.\n\nIt also seems really childish that people are so quick to frame which side they are on. The situation is more dynamic than that.\n\nAs a future service member, son of a former service member, and proud American I sincerely believe our technological advantage should continued to be use to gain a tactical advantage over a threat which refuses to meet us on the conventional battlefield. Our tactics are a response to the threat, not some evil method of punishing third-world nations. The friends and family I have seen destroyed by $25 worth of explosives detonated by a cell-phone on some desolate road in Iraq is mind blowing. Ask yourself, will ending the use of fire and forget weapons provide any incentive to the American people other than letting us feel warm and fuzzy at night? Perhaps ending those programs would lead to more training camps, bomb-shops, etc. which in turn would lead to more lost American lives? The situation is very complicated, and as an American trying to live his life, I would much rather know that my Government is using everything in its power to combat the threats we face just because we were born in America. I also take pride in knowing that unlike our enemy, our nation's forces won't fill their ruck sacks with bombs and detonate themselves in crowded Afghani markets to make a point."

"&gt; Yes, there's a general warrant, but you have still not provided evidence that they are using that against Americans.\n\nBy definition, a general warrant is the illegal wire tapping of all Americans. **It's not an actual warrant**. It's referred to as a general warrant to imply that they don't have a *real warrant*, just the \"general\" belief that they need to be engaged in their wide-scale monitoring. \n\nYou're supposed to have probable cause to get a specific warrant (ie - a real, lawful warrant) on an individual suspected of a crime. In this case there is no warrant, so what they do is described as a \"general warrant\" they ignore all of that and spy on everyone \"just in case\". You've already acknowledged they're doing that (impossible to ignore anymore since Snowden, but I digress). I'm not sure what you're struggling with - other than the fact that your government is spying on you and you don't know how to process that information.\n\ntl;dr - A General Warrant is not a real thing in law, it's a justification used by the NSA to engage in clearly illegal behavior."

"&gt; But you want a split at a higher level, and it is not clear what that actually means.\n\nWhat I meant by that was the more tolerant and fundamentalist branches break into two or more separate religions where one of them no longer goes by the name of Muslim, similar to how Christianity split from Judaism and to a smaller extent how the Protestant reformation separated the Protestant denominations from the Catholics. Side note: The Christian church actually was united under two major branches until the reformation, which split it into the hundreds we have today since none of them could agree on tiny doctrine issues. The reformation created one single branch that split over and over again, until you get three different versions of Baptists and \"reformed\" and \"traditional\" churches. \n\nThe issue I'm talking about is that all of them still call themselves Muslims whether they're fundamentalists, terrorists or moderates.\n\nIn my opinion, if a religion is having internal turmoil due to extremists, the only correct course of action is for ALL of the remaining adherents to denounce them and shun them from the group (which some have already done). Some refuse to do this, and that would be the catalyst for the split. The more moderate adherents would have to have had enough and break off into a totally new branch of the religion, or even start a completely new one."

"Hi there everyone. I don't like nuclear power. I also dislike shoddy journalism.[edit1:^] Thanks, Gizmodo. Anyways, after finishing up watching a movie with my mom and dad and grandparents this New Years Eve, as a single man in his late 20s is wont to do, I decided to actually *look* at this here Gizmodo link and backtrace it. Effectively, consequences will never be the same.\n\nGizmodo got this article from Fark which got it from The Ecologist which is basing it off a Tepco press release. To be honest, I have no clue what a Fark is, but the link just goes to \"fark.com\" so, whatever. The Ecologist, however, has their article: http://www.theecologist.org/News/news_round_up/2217953/fukushima_meltdown_mystery_steam_rising_over_reactor_3.html\n\nThe article's meatiest bit are two teeny paragraphs:\n&gt;And now fresh plumes of steam have been seen coming out the structure. These have now been confirmed by Tepco, the owner of the nuclear plant, from 19th December onwards. The company believes the steam is coming from the fifth floor of the building.\n\n&gt;However it does not know the cause of the steam. Lethal levels of radiation and the physical damage to the structure have so far made entry and inspection impossible.\n\nSo, I went to google translate and after some frustration I got it to sort out the original Tepco post.1 Points of interest:\n\nThe December 19th date on the Ecologist website? I can't find anything in the document except mention of steam that early. Those appear to be inspections in the turbine building and certain tanks:\n&gt;December 18, partner companies workers had been patrolling F area of ​​the tank (Units 5 and 6 north side), C6 tank flange communication pipe (C5 tank side) and C5 tank I found that the water is dropping about 1 drop in about one minute from the (joint) section. ...Was carried out the tightening of the joint to 0:48 December 19, but no change in dropping amount. (The C5 and C6 tank tank, water storage the turbine building of Unit 5 and 6 underground water retention)\n\nNothing to do with Unit 3...in fact here is the whole section for Unit 3:\n&gt;\"(Discontinued April 19, 2012) Unit 3\"\n-Water injection in-reactor to the reactor and nitrogen injection medium and the reactor containment vessel gas management system in operation, the spent fuel pool circulating cooling system operation to the reactor containment vessel fresh water and water source (CST) condensate storage tank (4 pm to December 17) The transfer of the high concentration accumulated water to (High Temperature Incinerator Building) medium and the turbine building of Unit 3 → centralized waste treatment facilities\n\n&gt;**※ 48 At around 7:00 am on December 27, and confirmed by the camera that from Unit 3 reactor building, 5th floor near the center, steam is generated. Have not been identified abnormal plant conditions of 54 minutes at 7:00 am the same day, the indicated value of the monitoring post (meteorological data of 50 minutes at 7:00 am, 5.1 ℃ temperature, 93.1% humidity).**\n\nBolded part is the updated information. The ecologist article is correct in Unit 3, 5th floor. \"Abnormal conditions have not been identified,\" I figure, means that as of the past few days they've had time to analyze this but haven't updated the info on their webpage.\n\nSo, I went digging further and found YESTERDAYS update which translates as:\n&gt;※48 At around 7:00 am on December 27, and confirmed by the camera that from Unit 3 reactor building, 5th floor near the center, steam is generated. Have not been identified abnormal plant conditions of 54 minutes at 7:00 am the same day, the indicated value of the monitoring post (meteorological data of 50 minutes at 7:00 am, 5.1 ℃ temperature, 93.1% humidity). **Then, in 45 minutes around 7:00 am December 30, steam is no longer observed. It should be noted, have not been identified abnormal plant conditions in 54 minutes at 7:00 am the same day, the indicated value monitoring posts, etc. (meteorological data of 50 minutes at 7:00 am, 6.8 ℃ temperature, 39.8% humidity).**2\n\nThe steam, therefore, started on the 27th. Ended on the 27th, within 45 minutes, in fact. These articles are all out of date and a little research basically just shows that The Ecologists 3 possibilities:\n1. a meltdown is taking place\n2. 'corium' has reached groundwater\n3. rainwater on stray fuel elements \n\nMay, just maybe, be a teensy bit off the mark. Although number 3 seems possible...I dunno, it seems silly to discount the possibility of a million other things at a massively complex nuclear facility or anything. I love worst case scenarios. But I also love to surf the web. In this case surfing&gt;worst case scenario. No Nuke 'Em High in California quite yet. :) :)\n\n\n1.

"You're kidding right? Under Chamberlain he drastically expanded the airforce at the expense of the army a move which he was criticized for but did ultimately help Britain in 1939 the RAF was receiving 400 new planes each month air raid shelters were constructed. He also increased defence spending in a time of economic trouble, his favouring of the airforce over the army played an instrumental role during the Battle of Britain. As for Germany being completely unprepared you are also wrong Hitler had been re-arming at an alarming rate and he had re-militarized the Rhineland violating the Treaty of Versailles on top of the Anschluss of Austria lead to the the 1938 crisis. If you are honestly going to tell me that if the allies declared war in 1938 because Germany was unprepared then at the same time say that the time bought by the Munich agreement didn't help Britain prepare for war but helped Germany then your argument makes no sense.

It was divided up between warlords of the Islamic International Brigade which slowly took control of the region. The IIB then attacked Dagestan, the closest neighbor under Russian control - starting yet another war with Russia.\n\nMeanwhile hundreds, literally hundreds of apartment bombs were going off in Moscow, as well as a international Kidnapping ring being used to fund the Islamic International Brigade. Soon after a hostage crisis in Moscow and continued terroist attacks, Russia had enough shit and went back into Chechnya and took back control. Russia rebuilt Grozny, and built up most of the infrastructure that had previously been destroyed by the first two wars in the 90s. "

It would be enough if they just threaten to cut gas and oil to Europe for EU to get on their feet and stop America from doing anything.\n\nIf putin wants to go to war against terrorism on his own turf, NO ONE will stop him."

"&gt; Any user identifiable information particularly customer data about purchases should have always used HTTPS before any public release.\n\nIt does seem like it. However, they treated the data which the phone uses (code) more carefully. They signed it, even when they didn't encrypt it, they signed it.\n\n&gt; Bottom line Apple is starting to look more and more like Microsoft of yore not just in market dominance, but showing a shakier reputation on security than Apple used to have.\n\nSay what? The standard for security has changed over time. The idea you can never send user data over the net in the clear is not something that even existed back in the times of \"MS of yore\".\n\n&gt; Smaller group, but again not impossible. It wouldn't be the first time Apple's contract manufacturer messed up either.\n\nBackfill, baby. Go ahead and backfill.\n\nThe people who make these things are trained how to make them. They aren't going to answer that question at all if it were to come up (the one about loading a developer certificate). They are given a script to follow it and they follow it.\n\nStop backfilling for losing track of the point. You lost track of that we weren't talking about end users. And you even simultaneously tried to say that if a customer did say yes to something that they shouldn't say yes to, that it would be relevant in a discussion about the idea of the NSA hacking through backdoors. *Customers clicking yes to messages to that they should say no to is the FRONT DOOR, not a backdoor.*\n\nYou're doubly off track here.\n\n&gt; Back in 2006, Apple accidentally shipped ipods that were loaded with some Windows malware.\n\nIndeed. That happens because the iPod mounts as a hard drive and worms are designed to (and capable of) putting files on drives that mount. Someone had an infected PC (or Mac?) and it infected all drives that mount, including the iPods.\n\niPhones don't mount as drives.\n\nAnd furthermore, the malware on those iPods never ran on the iPod. It didn't affect the iPod in any way. So giving that as an example of how the NSA would hack into your phone is to not understand the issues at all.\n\n&gt; You presume that what the OEM says to put on the device is bit for bit the same 100% of the time.\n\nIt likely is so. But again, the iPhone uses trusted computing, if the image to go on is altered in a way that doesn't match the digital signature, the device likely wouldn't accept it. It certainly wouldn't run it. Apple doesn't want you hacking into your own iPhone, and the same methods they use to keep you out will keep bribed Foxconn employees out too.\n\n&gt; I wouldn't be surprised if there are malicious organizations in China that would attempt to bribe some relatively lowly paid Foxconn employee to change the image that was getting written to flash memory in the factory.\n\nSo what? How you get from there to the phone actually running it is the unsupported logical leap."

It's how we behave.  You can choose to make use of this knowledge to help yourself, or you can choose to continue to blame the world for your own choices in dress and presentation.\n\nBut there is absolutely no one but you who is responsible for how you dress."

The amount of people attending these protests sometimes numbers in the tens of thousands. But, hey, the 650 total protesters you pulled out of you ass is probably right, too. Why not? It's not like you based that figure on absolutely nothing.\n\n\npreposterous? No. 130 million/200K = 650. If 650 protested only once and if all 130 million protested at least once, you get exactly 200K protests a year. It's simple division. Even you can do it. \n\n&gt;You also completely refused to acknowledge the fact that Chinese people have plenty of access to information that counters what's written in their textbooks.\n\n\nThere's nothing to address. Isn't it obviously people are capable of accessing what information made available to them? BTW China employs millions to censor the web. What information do you think they are capable of accessing? This too is your fixed alternative belief. \n\n&gt;&gt;It's more telling to read their writings on the web, news, as well as other postings and musings.\n\n&gt;That's why I said:\n\n&gt;&gt;You should maybe spend some time talking to actual Chinese people or reading their opinions on the internet before you assume that the average person is brainwashed.\n\nMaybe you should read what they write in anonymous setting. What you said makes no sense. \"Give a man a mask, and he will tell you the truth.\"\n\nIf you're an American surely you can understand the freedom that comes from anonymity as there is no such thing in China. \n\n&gt;And if you would do that, you would easily see that despite the 90% satisfaction rating from one survey, there are millions and millions of Chinese people who are critical of their government. I do not need to waste my time picking apart the survey, when even common sense and a Google search would reveal that more than 10% of Chinese do in fact have criticisms of their government.\n\n\nAnd if I were to do that, then as you claimed earlier, face is an extremely important issue in China. So you will get a lie from a Chinese. Right? You did say that. \n\nGoogle doesn't give you enough statistical evidence to claim \"more than 10% of Chinese do in fact have criticisms of their government.\"  You realize google uses page rankings? \n \n\nThat's just a silly nonsense. \n"

"I know you didn't just throw it out, that's why I said you were the exception. Also, sources mean nothing when the sources contradict the narrative the commenter was building or when the sources are just empty sourcespam or otherwise speculative rubbish. What the other commenter 'sourced' was utterly useless, even though some were good sources, his post itself was mostly inaccurate. Sources don't mean anything when your entire post is simply wrong. They won't make it right if it isn't. \n\nFor example, lots of speculation exists over the Litivinenko affair, but in the end it is all speculation. What we do know is that he had a lot of rich oligarchs as enemies in Russia and that oligarchs in Russia have a penchant for popping snitches or journalists and that Litvinenko was in need of money and he was about to begin to reveal sensitive information about them. While Putin *may* have actually ordered the assassination, it doesn't really make sense because there were far more important turncoats or turncoat spies who revealed much more crucial information than Litvinenko. They generally stayed alive. Litvinenko did not. And he died at such an odd time too. If Putin wanted him dead because he was a defector, why not snuff him not long after the defection, not, you know, six years later. \n\nSaying Putin bumped Litvinenko is speculative and frankly ignorant rubbish. I have no doubts that Putin is an evil man, but let's not invent tall tales here. Of course, all this being said, it is very likely that Putin was aware of the plot to kill Litvinenko but chose to do nothing about it. "

"That, and I know that using fictional work tropes in real life is horrifying (and it really *should* be) is because Putin (and Russia) is at best an anti-heroic figure, and a recent if not current villain, on the global political scene, whose extreme statements and tactics are expected by the public.  Putin vows total annihilation, kills outspoken journalists, it's just business as usual - playing into the role the world expects and applauds.\n\nMeanwhile the United States is, at least in its own press and its apparent intended portrayal, a paragon of heroic virtue and a bastion of good and just virtues like freedom and democracy.  When they vow or perform reprehensible actions it's viewed as hypocritical and an unforgivable breaking of role that inevitably drives backlash and the pain that comes when reality and archetypes ultimately disconnect from one-another.\n\nSo people feel reassurance and calm when Putin does bad things because he's Putin.  People feel horror when the USA does bad things because they're the USA.  One has a crafted international image that's a little closer to the brutal truth than the other."

"nezlok is correct on the basics.\n\nI have been here for 11 years, also with a Chinese wife, and a large group of Chinese friends and acquaintances. We get together every week to talk about all kinds of stuff. Basically, Chinese people know they have no control over the government, and so they don't really care about what the government does. This leaves plenty of time and energy for making money which is the social and ultimately the political currency of the day.\n\nThe education system, as bad and abusive as it is, really does teach a lot, although without emphasis on creativity or rational thinking. This puts the Chinese citizens at a competitive disadvantage in many way but it insulates the government from a generalized attack by the middle class. "

The electric power consumption, varies on the day of the week and public holidays influence the consumption too. \n\nThe current grid, is purely designed as a one way hose, to deliver power from the generating company direct to the consumer. \n\nNow, if 22 million Tesla Cars, were plugged into the smart grid, their combined battery power, could be temporarily fed back into the system, via the sub grids switching around the damaged section main/sub grid feed lines. Once the power is restored their batteries will be recharged. \n\nThe article fails to mention that daily consumer electric power consumption is highly variable. Nor does it mention electric power companies increase/decrease the number of operational generator sets according to demand dependent on the time of the day power consumption for both industry specific requirements, for city dwellers and the lower consuming lower population density rural areas. Daily electric power consumption also changes during official public holidays when many industries are closed down for the festive season.

I also grew up with a Christian mother and her values too. \n\nI can also tell that despite the scripture of Islam calling for unity among all Muslims, our beliefs are hardly monolithic, and thus practices vary heavily from country to country, culture to culture, and in some cases tribe to tribe. Many who call themselves Muslim don't agree on many things. So different circumstances can dcitate just how compatible with Western culture we are.

"Putin is a pathetic little boy full of temper tantrums, threats, and strutting around with his shirt off like a little boy.  What a sad comedown for a great people like Russians to be \"led\" by this miserable excuse for a leader. I hope the next time he pretends to wrestle a bear, someone gets a real bear for poor little Vlad to wrestle instead of a teddy bear. \n\nThere are so many ethnic and other hatreds in the lands of the former Soviet Union, all exacerbated by the Soviets for 70+ years that it's going to take decades for them to simmer down.  Nothing Putin can do about it, not even his childish little threats about \"annihilation,\" except negotiate. You cannot threaten or destroy people anymore if their anger is legitimate.  \n\nAnyone who thinks even for a minute that Russian power can \"annihilate\" terrorism knows nothing about history.  First of all, terrorism is the way the Soviet Union was created from 1917-21, and it was the way that horrible nation was run by its murderous leaders.  And it failed, utterly, in the end.  \n\nIn the Soviets' major effort after WWII, they also failed utterly in Afghanistan, despite all their so called \"power\".  Today, the Russians could send a million man army into the southern regions of Russia, and all it would do is bleed Russia dry for years with no hope of any lasting victory.  You'd have to kill every single person to call it a \"victory\".  Putin can't be that stupid.  What he'll do is round up a few likely candidates, give them a show trial (like the old Soviets did) and execute them.  All to no purpose and just to make him look like a strong man.  How inept and impotent he is, and how weak Russia is today, a land of drunks, thieves, and strutting corrupt politicians.  Truly pathetic.  \n\nWe can only hope that the stupid Sochi Winter Olympics collapses one way or the other so he looks like the inept politician and idiot he is.  Hey, Vlad, take off your shirt and wrestle this bear, would ya?  "

Anyone with a more progressive way of thinking think that JFK, Clinton and Obama were right, despite their dirty laundry. People like Nixon succeed in pissing off everyone. But I digress, people see Putin as a god among politicians   because he's the epitome of \"get shit done\", even if he's one of the most evil politicians on the planet right now. I don't really care one way or another. I just like the concept of lesser evil vs. greater evil. Perhaps casting my fondness for fantasy scenarios onto a real, serious situation is immature, but if I were particularly inclined to political beliefs, I would likely take it much more serious. But Putin's reputation for being heartless and unrelenting makes people of the mind that a leader should be ironclad and not weak think of him as a great president, even for all of his insane, cruel methods and practices."

We are interested in developing friendly relations according to clear and strong principles.”\n&gt;\n&gt; Bandar said that the matter is not limited to the kingdom and that some countries have overstepped the roles drawn for them, such as Qatar and Turkey. He added, “We said so directly to the Qataris and to the Turks. We rejected their unlimited support to the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and elsewhere. The Turks’ role today has become similar to Pakistan’s role in the Afghan war. We do not favor extremist religious regimes, and we wish to establish moderate regimes in the region. It is worthwhile to pay attention to and to follow up on Egypt’s experience. We will continue to support the [Egyptian] army, and we will support Defense Minister Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Sisi because he is keen on having good relations with us and with you. And we suggest to you to be in contact with him, to support him and to give all the conditions for the success of this experiment. We are ready to hold arms deals with you in exchange for supporting these regimes, especially Egypt.”"

Eventually, radicalism will become unpopular enough for the people of that country to deal with the issues themselves.

"&gt;Man, it's almost like Reddit is a website made up of hundreds of thousands of different users with differing opinions or something.  \n  \nlol this makes no sense. you misread it and thought he was pointing out a contradiction in the hivemind"
"Not to my satisfaction.\n\n[Is this the comment that you're talking about?](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1u3y4x/vladimir_putin_vows_total_annihilation_of/ceel7sf)\n\n&gt;How do you know that it is the same redditors that simultaneously like and support Putin's terrorist tactics but condemn the US anti-terrorist tactics? What blows my mind is the legions of idiots on this site that literally assign all common opinions around here into a super meta-redditor embodiment of all of those contradictory opinions and then call that imaginary embodiment a hypocrite.\n\nOne guy responded with five uninteresting words with hardly any explanatory vale, but none of this addresses the tendency for early and highly-upvoted comments to be baseless and irrational in the way that I mentioned. And it looks like you haven't weighed in on this, so here's your chance. You called it an 'ever-present inconsistency'. Its presence hasn't revealed itself to *me*. You left yourself a lot of room to work with by not offering anything concrete, so maybe you can let us in on where you got the idea that such an inconsistency exists. I'm asking you to back up your implication that the two apparently contradictory opinions about 'anti-terror tactics' that you alleged in your comment often coexist in the same threads.\n\nI'm not asking you to address the all-too-facile suggestion that two opinions being expressed in the same general place indicates that there's anybody who holds both of them. You gave an answer to somebody else's comment about that, but in it you ascribed a particular thought to a large group (the group itself; not individuals within it). Clearly, there's no sense in travelling with you down that road. Nor am I asking you to support your claim that expressions of horror at US policy are feigned. That's clearly impossible. All that inclusion did was tip off the more thoughtful readers that there might be other shenanigans in the post.\n\nFeel free to disregard the rest. It's just an analysis of how such comments keep getting upvoted.\n\nYour comment wouldn't be so highly upvoted if people did read all the way down. I'm really not seeing much that indicates the presence of the sentiment that you conveyed in your comment, a sentiment that is belied by the popularity of your comment itself, by the way. These comments are upvoted because upvoting them is a way for people who aren't capable of explaining themselves (and who happen to be drawn in by the simplicity of these comments) to make their voices heard without the risk of having to defend them. It goes along with flag-waving culture. Patriotism seems to resonate with people who aren't very bright. I'm not saying that your comment exudes patriotism, but people with that particular bias seem to want to make themselves seem embattled, so they promote such opinions without considering how true or well-supported they are, and probably without reading beyond the first couple of comments for a sanity check. These are the types of minds that associate the popularity of a claim with the likelihood of its veracity. So seeing the sort of claim that they agree with right at the top further fortifies their opinion (and surely some sad souls can't figure out that this means that there *are* many people who think the same way they do). If this isn't going on, I can't see why people are still upvoting your comment, given the dearth of visible evidence that the position it claims is true. Maybe there are some who understand that what they're promoting isn't true, but want to promote it anyway. I guess it doesn't help that many people are probably drunk right now--a few hundred doesn't seem implausible--which makes them both stupider and less likely to look beyond the top comment. Beyond that, I'm clueless."

If the Church was so anti science why did they get try to respect the astronomical system of a pagan who was considered one of the antiquities greatest thinkers?\nThe Church was open to new evidence, Galileo at first did not offer very good evidence. Shouldn't science demand rigorous proof? Cardinal Bellarmine said \"if there were a real proof that the Sun is in the centre of the universe, that the Earth is in the third sphere, and that the Sun does not go round the Earth but the Earth round the Sun, then we should have to proceed with great circumspection in explaining passages of Scripture which appear to teach the contrary, and we should rather have to say that we did not understand them than declare an opinion to be false which is proved to be true\" \n\nAlso the whole Galileo was as much about politics as it was about heliocentrism.

"You could also argue that all \"religious\" motivations from terrorists groups stemming from the Middle East are primarily based in nationalism.

They're pissed off that Palestine has been occupied by Israel. They're pissed off because they want a Chechnya free from Russia.\n\nI'm not condoning any of this. I think it's disgusting and I think terrorism is cowardly. I just think it's inaccurate and dangerous to think that if only these people weren't religious, they wouldn't have the same grievances that they do now. Think about religious fundamentalism in the US -- it's not really religious at all. Contorted and ancient interpretations of scripture have been used for years in order to justify discomfort with difference (gays, interracial marriage, women being people and not just property, etc).

"Don't underestimate Topol M\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOQNJ58YIoo\n\nThose mobile launchers make it a survivable delivery system. It can be MIRV'd. The warheads are probably pretty hard to intercept too. Plus of course Russia can simply build them in volume to overwhelm a missile defence system.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RT-2UTTKh_Topol-M\n\n&gt; The Topol-M is a cold-launched, three-stage, solid-propellant, silo-based or road-mobile intercontinental ballistic missile.[7] The missile's length is 22.7 m and the first stage has a body diameter of 1.9 m. The mass at launch is 47,200 kg, including the 1200 kilogram payload. Topol-M carries a single warhead with a 800 kt yield [1] but the design is compatible with MIRV warheads. According to chief designer Yury Solomonov, the missile can carry four to six warheads along with decoys.[8] Its minimum range is estimated to be 2,000 km and the maximum range 10,500 km.[7] It has three solid rocket stages with inertial, autonomous flight control utilizing an onboard GLONASS receiver.[9][10] It is reputed to have the highest accuracy of any Russian ICBM[11] with a CEP of 200m.[12] The body of the rocket is made by winding carbon fiber.\n&gt;\n&gt; The Topol-M may be deployed either inside a reinforced missile silo, which is reported to be able to withstand a direct nuclear hit[11] or from an APU 15U168 launcher mounted on the MZKT-79221 \"Universal\" 16-wheeled transporter-erector-launcher.[11] This mobile launcher is capable of moving through roadless terrain, and launching a missile from any point along its route. The designation for the silo-based Topol-M missile is believed to be RS-12M2, while the mobile version is RS-12M1\n\n...\n\n&gt; According to Russia the missile is designed to be immune to any current or planned U.S. missile defense system.[19] It is claimed to be capable of making evasive maneuvers to avoid a kill by terminal phase interceptors, and carries targeting countermeasures and decoys. It is shielded against radiation, EMP, nuclear explosions at distances over 500 meters, and is designed to survive a hit from any laser technology.[20]\n&gt;\n&gt; One of the Topol-M's most notable features is its short engine burn time following take-off, intended to minimize satellite detection of launches and thereby complicate both early warning and interception by missile defense systems during boost phase. The missile also has a relatively flat ballistic trajectory, complicating defense acquisition and interception.[21]\n&gt;\n&gt; According to The Washington Times, Russia has conducted a successful test of the evasive payload delivery system.[22] The missile was launched on November 1, 2005 from the Kapustin Yar facility. The warhead changed course after separating from the launcher, making it difficult to predict a re-entry trajectory.\n\nYou won't [get lucky](http://www.wimp.com/choirlucky/) with Russia's Strategic Nuclear Forces."

On the other hand Russia has had 100 years of not caring about individual rights and of putting the state in the first place - their history, their culture, shows that they don't care about the individual, so I don't expect them to.

So the poorest having money is a really small part of the total amount of money in a country's economy.\n\nYou've also got to consider the increased spending power, because now you've got people buying stuff they wouldn't be able to buy before, computers, nicer TVs, those kinds of luxuries.\n\nPrices wouldn't really go up much to meet the demand, because if they do go up too much then they lock out the people who just started buying stuff. What would probably happen is an increased need for labor to meet with the new demand."

Child abuse is not doctrine, cover-ups are not doctrine, heterosexual marriage is. \r\rIt seems that many of those who would beg tolerance for demographic minorities only extend their support for 'fashionable' minorities. \r\rRegardless of our personal stance, the Catholic belief system is ultimately based on the notion that it is divine in origin.

"Let's make this clear: None of your sources actually support your claim. The main allegation you refer to concerns cooperation with China in the design of the Chengdu J-10 fighter based on the Israeli Lavi- which was an Israeli design, and *not* based on reverse-engineered American technology as you claimed. (Incidentally, the Lavi was also not \"based on the U.S. F-16 Falcon,\" as one of the articles you linked claims.^[[1]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk%3AIAI_Lavi#F-16_copy) It bears some similarities to the F-16 due to its very similar operational role, but is in fact a very different aircraft in all accounts.)\n\nThe most serious allegations in the articles concern Israeli transfer of American technology to the Chinese, who then reverse-engineered it themselves to incorporate into their designs. (The most directly applicable quote from your sources: \"'China is benefiting from reverse-engineering American technology provided to Israel,' added Mr. Wortzel, a retired Army colonel who says he saw evidence of improper transfers while a counterintelligence officer in the 1980s.\")\n\nTransfer of American technology to the Chinese by Israel does appear to have occurred in the past without American knowledge. To be clear, this is indeed a very serious breach of trust by Israel; but it is a very distinct act from the one you were trying to prove, which is, to remind you: That Israel reverse-engineered U.S. fighter technology (it did not), incorporated it into the Lavi fighter (it did not), and then sold the Lavi to China (it possibly did).\n\nI will ignore the creepiness of you comment-stalking me and the irrelevant ad-hominem accusations of bias; it does nothing but degrade this discussion."

"I sorted the thread by the time of the posts, and, although there were some temporal anomalies (comments appearing in the wrong order), I feel comfortable saying that there didn't appear to be much that supported your post. Anybody is free to point out posts that do support your claim. I noticed one such comment, and it may have been upvoted when you posted, but it didn't seem like there was much support for what you were saying. How many upvotes could they have had after three hours, and how would those three hours be a reliable indicator of the inner 'thoughts' of an entire forum of hundreds of thousands or millions (depending on the definition) of 'members'? One thing that I considered was that you were also talking about other threads that you'd seen, rather than other posts within this thread. I now guess that you didn't mean that.\n\nThe viewpoint that your comment expressed is shown to be untrue by its popularity. That's more of a complaint against the more recent upvoters than against you, but you might feel tempted to consider that, by your conception of what constitutes the consensus of the subreddit, you're part of the countervailing winds of logical consistency (which you promote) and hypocrisy (which you oppose but claim to exist). Importantly, that doesn't commit you (or anyone else) to both positions. If such an apparent inconsistency exists, what's the point in alleging blame if there's nobody to accept it? Maybe you do have a point on that issue, but it's just not getting through to me.\n\nI'm not upset that a comment can turn the tide in a discussion, but I'm no fan of the breed of populism that reddit facilitates. I like my explanation of people's reactions to these posts more than your \"People talk, people disagree, and people decide.\" My version is \"People click, people see an opinion they like, and people upvote.\" I just don't see the point of promoting a comment that does little besides impugn an amorphous 'group' (if it can even be called that) that may not even exist in any meaningful sense. \n\nAnyway, thanks for not being a tool about this.

Then I heard they paid him like a quarter million dollars(not 100% sure what it really was, that was the gossip) to come speak and I realized that the green movement is forcing itself on the world with political guns. Bill Clinton was totally clueless about solar, but he gave the convention a headline and he was definitely selling his influence for the product. I guess my point is, whether or not global warming/climate change is going to be terrible or a whimper, the people who profit from that fear mongering are going to drill the message into your head like a baptist preacher talking about gay marriage causing every problem in the world. Also, if you think the government can do anything to fix this problem, take a look at the problems they are already \"fixing\". If we put government in control of the climate, I guarantee it'll become a racket run by cartels and the amount of CO2 will shoot through the roof."

In 1967, the Supreme Court declared those laws unconstitutional.    \nHowever, that's not the whole story: by the time the ruling happened, most states which once had laws banning interracial unions had repealed those laws, the vast majority in the two decades prior to the ruling.\n\nThings change based on public will and perception, and we know that because it's happened before.

"It's cute how you say \"took money\" because you probably know that USAID has been [banned from Russia since 2012](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-19644897). USAID is basically the CIA doing openly what it did privately in the 80s. Which is what pisses off a lot of countries, because they can see quite plainly that the US likes funding disruptive organizations within a given country. If only to mix things up.\n\nBut generally the protest against Putin isn't going to be backed by USAID, it's grassroots. So your crying foul about NGO's getting US funding is a bit off the mark and misleading.\n\nFact is most Russians have [become more amiable to gay relationships](http://www.opendemocracy.net/od-russia/alexander-kondakov/do-russians-give-damn-about-homosexuality), or at least are ambivalent, Putin has been channeling anti-gay sentiment due to Russia's birth rate decline (which, btw, isn't as bad as the US, or Germany, or most developed world nations, and is in fact a good predictor of living standard). It has little to do with being for some moral compass that the Russian people have, it is purely about creating a phantom, like the Republicans did with choice or immigration or homosexuality in the United States. Fortunately they are getting rebuffed pretty quick in political time frames here (anti-gay laws in the early 2000s, now it appears that gay marriage will be legal country-wide in 5 years tops).\n\nThe anti-gay crap in Russia is a farce. It's all a response to the anti-Putin protesters, because they're activists, and are more likely to support homosexuals.\n\nAs a Russian you seem pretty ill informed or at least ignorant of the propaganda you're subject to. That is unfortunate, as it may indicate that Russia doesn't have a chance going forward and the regressive policies will continue. Anti-American sentiment in the coming years will be interesting to behold since the US demographically is moving left and policies are going to usher in more progressive policies (drug decriminalization, gay marriage, probably universal health care eventually)."

And there's no denying that nationalism plays a big part in the Neo Nazi and fascist ideologies, and they are the most vocal when it comes to that sort of trash, hence my comment. But at least we agree Neo Nazis are stupid, especially when you know they're from countries that used to be colonies, and are still somehow stupid enough to think there is a difference between those born in a country and those who moved there.\n\nRegardless, your claim was that nationalism keeps people civilized, but that is demonstratively false."

Fuck it, I'm a gay Russian man, why the hell do I have to listen to your bullshit when I can get a plane back home and see how fast it takes me to get beat up for being openly gay? Being gay in Russia is hard, I am glad I am not back there now. I'm not a flamboyant type at all, but sometimes people can notice and at other times I just want to feel free to not have to hide my identity because the moment the news of my sexuality spreads, I am going to face prejudice and who knows, maybe even a beating from my local friendly neighbourhood social club. \n\nOf course Putin is creating a phantom, but he's a smart bastard, he knows whom to pick on for maximum effect. \n\nI don't know if you're a clueless Westerner or just a delusional Russian, but either way you are outright lying about the situation of gays in Russia. My father's best friend was also gay, he got beaten to death with glass bottles. Big fuckin' load of tolerance really. Granted, that was in 2003, but that's still goddamn unacceptable. \n\n\nWhat propaganda I am subject to? What sort of shite are you pulling out of your arse now, I said I read BBC and Economist. I literally have no exposure to any Russian media, I don't trust any of it. Both sides lie straight through their faces, we have no concept of neutral journalism back home, not that most countries do when it comes to internal politics. \n\nYou better be just a Russian with a different viewpoint, because if you're another self-congratulating, puffed up Western 'expert' on Russia, then you can fuck off, because I am pretty damn tired of Western idiots who think they know Russia lecturing about how things are *in my goddamn country* (I swear, 99% of them haven't even ever set foot on Russian soil).

In this sense, it is something that America and Russia has in common: entire industries devoted to the agitprop product of hatred of Islam.\n\nSo when you see this bit flipping from one side: \"America sucks for its attacks\" versus \"Russia rocks for its attacks\", its not because there is any hypocrisy.  Its just that America has a 'good cop' hat on, and Russia has the 'bad cop' hat on, and what is happening is that we are *all* being sold on the idea of hating Islam, Muslims, and anyone who wishes to not live a carbon-copy lifestyle derived from the Christians.\n"

There's only one way this ends and it's with rights for gays. It's just a short term power grab and he probably knows it.

My father served in a Soviet Army unit, they had two openly gay men and while this was not necessarily common, it was accepted in his unit, even to the level of the two men having relationships. Now as I grew up I didn't know much, but I slowly got the hang of what I should and should not do/say. People are becoming *more aware* I would say of the gay issue. People before didn't seem to care much, it wasn't a topic you discussed and nobody really heard anything about gays other than there are quite a few but they mostly keep to themselves. Now I know that if certain people back home found out who I was, I would find myself beaten the moment I left a local bar. It's a bit better in larger cities, but at the same time also very dependent on not coming across the wrong people. \n\nPolls are tricky, I don't know what to say about them because the one you've shown me is the first positive I've seen.

"Yes and no.\n\nPound-for-pound, atmospheric methane causes more warming than CO2.\n\nHOWEVER, CO2 is a bigger problem because there's a lot more CO2 in the atmosphere than methane and CO2 stays there longer than methane. (Tangentially, CO2 also causes ocean acidification while methane does not.) Methane has a lifetime of only about 12 years; CO2 lasts longer than that, but there's not a well-defined figure. Most of emitted CO2 is removed from the atmosphere within a century, but some 20% will stay there for millennia ([source](http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/faq-10-3.html)).\n\nEven rather large reductions of CO2 emissions would only slow the growth of atmospheric CO2, not stabilize it. And even if we stopped industrial CO2 emissions completely, it would take centuries for the earth to cool to pre-industrial temperatures."

"&gt;They were given independence. Rather than enjoying it, they took it as a sign of victory and proceeded with their campaign of terror in Moscow hoping to score further gains.\nGrozny has long been rebuilt and looks like a clean, modern city.\n\nThat's pretty intellectually dishonest. Russia gave them independence just like the USA gave Vietnam it's independence. Also, the Russia terror campaign of reducing Grozny to rubble is not cool just because it has been rebuilt since.\n\nThe horrible terror attacks done by the wahhabist were not directed or sanctioned or approved by the Chechen government. The disproportionate political power gained by the wahhabists was largely due to Basayev, who had gained a lot of influence from repelling the Russian forces during the first war.\n\nBut true, the wahhabists still waging the conflict are mostly not even chechens. However, their presence is unquestionably the end result of the first war. I understand it's easy to say that war was a fucking dumb move by Yeltsin and that we wouldn't be here without it.\n\nI hope Putin the best luck with catching the wahhabists!

"Its a fox newsish site and therefore untrustworthy.  Unfortunately with how messed up TEPCO is (politicians mostly with very few competent people with nuclear knowhow), having all four reactors in meltdown AND loss of atleast TWO spent fuel pools are pretty much guaranteed.  The only people who know what is really going on AND can help fix it have been banned (US and EU nuclear energy response).  Alot of the pictures we have been seeing were from US drones that flew over the reactor after japan forbid us from doing so.  \n\nSadly this will probably spell the doom for nuclear energy worldwide.  Nuclear power in CAPABLE hands and run by COMPETENT people who are ONLY worried about SAFE power and not some profits should be the ONLY way this is run.  Instead corporate morons have sent us off the deep end to a catastrophe that makes chernobyl look like a fuel leak in a traffic accident.  "

[0](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_Daiichi_nuclear_disaster_casualties#Casualties). In essence, that makes 1 nuclear reactor in history to be the direct cause of death from radiation exposure to be 50 (though that may be expected to rise concerning Chernobyl). \n\nThe [Banqiao Dam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banqiao_Dam#Casualties) failure killed 26,000 people from the direct catastrophe and in total upwards of 230,000 people.

"The war of Russian and Chechens (Northern Caucasus Muslims) goes on for more than 150 years. They resisted Russian occupation more than anybody else. In XIX century they fought 30 years - tiny population against giant military machine of the Russian Empire. Then they war restarted when Germans came and many Chechens sided with Germans. For that the TOTAL population was shipped to Kazakhstan in animal transport railroad cars. Quarter of that population died in the process. Chechens waited until Russia became weak again when Eltsyn came to power in the beginning of the nighties and resurrected again. This is now called, rather historically inaccurate, First Chechen War. At least they gave it a number, since after than there was another, Second Chechen War.  \n\nIrish and English has been at it may be longer, but the difference in culture and religion is not that big, it's hard for many Muslims even to get what the heck is different between Protestants and Catholics - both drink a lot, both worship a human child of a human mother (excellent, highly revered, but still, people). \n\nPutin did a clever thing with Chechnya: he left it to the complete powers of the local criminal, Kadyrov, son of the traitor Kadyrov and second, he showered the region with money. But that can go only that long. The neighboring republic, Dagestan, is very poor, with ineffective leadership and population that had the same history with Russians. \n\nHere you go."

"I figure that those with good worth ethic and a sense of social meaning will want to work, for the betterment of themselves and everyone else.

Those folks typically fill the jobs that aren't really that necessary and could easily be replaced, by other people or machines.\n\nA guaranteed income could keep those people out of the way so they can, hopefully, do better things with themselves or at least not cause problems for others. Provided the amount given is enough to live decently and not in/near poverty, which could in turn prevent crime.

Even if the 9/11 attacks happened every year, I'd give 0.001% of a shit about being killed by terrorists.\n\nThus I'm willing to tolerate very little in the way of intrusion on my personal freedom and liberty in the name of safety so long as my odds of being killed are so low. If I'm being inconvenienced for more than 0.0047% of my life by law enforcement/intelligence agencies, I'd rather that the odds of the *bad guys* killing me got a bit higher in return for less hassle.\n\nAnd unfortunately the balance is tipped far in the other direction, spending 0.0047% of your time being inconvenienced by law enforcement comes out to 24 minutes a year, and you wait a minimum of that every single time you fly.\n\nNow add in all the ID checks elsewhere... average time spent incarcerated by a member of the population... time spent waiting to get \"secure\" ID cards at the DMV... time spent on money that goes to taxes funding intelligence agencies...\n\nIt's quite literally a cancer on our society in the name of *security theater*, while *actual cancer* is around 276,000 times more likely to kill you than the imaginary boogie men that our trillions of tax dollars are going to fight, by locking us all up and spying on all of us."

You have no clue what capitalism is, and calling something which has a name, corporatism, \"modern capitalism\" is just you showing how little you care about your opinion being informed. Imagine if I went into a thread about the NBA and I started talking about which characters from NBA jam could do the coolest \"on fire\" dunks as if it related to the sport and their actual ability. That is what you sound like when you say \"modern economics partnered with a concept\"..... no it fucking didn't.... special interests lobbied to get their industries protected, subsidized, exempted, deregulated, reregulated and every other coercive act they could in order to gain at the expense of all their competitors. That is the natural course of all market place economies as the people vote in politicians to give themselves more and more power over the market they interact in. If you give a shit about the homeless, if you care about the hungry, if you give even an afterthought to the needy, the only thing in the history of the world that has ever brought their standard of living up was a free market and free trade. That's it. We've tried every \"a chicken in every pot\" political/national/social scheme to get the poor out of the doldrums and it has never worked, not once, not ever. So blame crony capitalists or socialists for capitalism all you want. And the most charitable society that has ever existed, BY A HUGE MARGIN, is also the richest with the freest market, that was the USA."
"Mind telling me which of these problems were caused by US and UK intervention?  Last I checked we weren't the ones who encouraged China to try out Soviet style industrialization resulting in massive poverty and starvation, nor did we roll out tanks when the people tried to affect change in their country.  We did some fucked up shit during the occupation for sure, but China's problems run way deeper than that.  The biggest problem China has is the 没办法 attitude.  If people thought there was the possibility of change, a lot of these problems would have been fixed by now."
"We are also forgetting that the Chechens have a legitimate cause. They don't want to be a part of Russia, they are essentially occupied. The Russians forced them into the Soviet union and have been oppressing them ever since.\n\nThe Chechens haven't been allowed to have an election about seceding and becoming an independent state. Lots of other Eastern states have become independent so why not Chechnya "
"Sorry, maybe it's common knowledge, but how do Indians know which caste they belong to? I mean, is it based on family history? Or the region of the country you're born in? Can you change caste somehow? Or maybe if you can't change, could you \"fake it\"?"

"We had something similar the US constitution (The tenth amendment):\n\n&gt;The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\n\nCompare that to the EU version:\n\n&gt;Under the principle of subsidiarity, in areas which do not fall within its exclusive competence, the Union shall act only if and in so far as the objectives of the proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, either at central level or at regional and local level, but can rather, by reason of the scale or effects of the proposed action, be better achieved at Union level.\n\nIn many ways, the US version is more limiting, because it requires that powers exercised by the federal government be expressly granted to it in the constitution, whereas the EU version relies on jurisprudence to make judgment calls on what level of achievement in any type of goal is 'sufficient' to disallow a federal exercise of power.\n\nMake no mistake, the US was originally a very loose association of separate states with distinct populations and cultures (Certainly not to the degree that Europe is, but people were a lot more isolated then and there wasn't as much shared cultural experiences over wide areas, so that might balance it out). It took many decades, several cases of our supreme court, and a couple of amendments to our constitution (most notably the 14th) to make our federal government as powerful as it is.\n\nThe most power-hungry people congregate to where they can exercise the most power, and they seek to expand that power. Most of the people involved in the central government will want to extend the power of the central government. As long as decisions of the central government can take precedence over decisions of the state governments, the ability to exercise power will shift toward the central government. It's much more difficult to move power in the other direction.\n\nIn 200 years the EU states will be as toothless as US states.\n"

"&gt; But the whole book is the author's or the publisher's, and not yours to copy.\n\nThat is begging the question. You're whole argument is based on the assumption that strong intellectual property rights are natural and inviolable.\n\nFirst, the legal basis for copyright law is in Article I, Section 8 of the US constitution: (it is fairly representative of the common law justification of copyright and the US has been adamant about the rest of the world adopting their copyright laws, thus it is the most relevant starting point for any discussion of the legitimacy of such laws)\n\n&gt;To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.\n\nIt is clear that the intent is not to protect the rights of individual authors and inventors but the right of the public to an intellectual commons. There is an explicit measuring stick of intellectual progress that can be brought to bear. If it can be shown that copyright and patent laws (trademark also gets lumped into intellectual property despite having an entirely different line of justification, so I wish to distinguish between them at this point) hamper progress rather than foster it, then they ought to be considered unconstitutional.\n\nThe exchange value of a book may be in the authors ability to hold a monopoly on its sale, but the use value is solely based on how widespread its readership is and the freedom of others to expand on it. There is a direct contradiction here, trying to maximise the exchange value necessarily depletes the use value of the work. Strong copyright and patent laws necessarily diminish the intellectual commons that they ostensibly exist to protect."

I think racism is bad, but I'm fine with people criticising a culture.\n\nThe issue at hand here is that some individuals like to treat their religion or culture as others treat inherent genetic differences. Whilst they may feel strongly about those things, it's simply not the same. Equally irritating is people who mock culture and religion as a form of racism, or who try to conceal or dress up their racism in the form of mocking culture or religion.\n\nI think it's important to differentiate these things clearly, but people who feel attacked will often attempt to hide behind cries of racism or discrimination. \n\nAs long as we allow people to do this without calling them out on it, we allow them to shield ideas and opinions that should be open for discussion and criticism."

Also it's not as if they left Chechnya in ruins, they built lots of schools and hospitals, along with general infrastructure.\n\nHe was right in calling them foreign agents, they were caught paying protesters and if there were NGOs in the U.S funded by the Russian or Chinese gov, no one would like that either.\n\nYour \"brutal measures\" aren't much, in fact, homosexuals are allowed to donate blood in Russia unlike in the U.S(though Russian politicians want to change this), you wanna know whats brutal? Stoning people who are gay in the middle east, beating and sometimes killing them in Jamaica (which the U.S has lots of tourism with), or the other many places that have violent laws. The only reason why there is any focus on Russia is because they're a geopolitical rival (not foe, since they have a lot of cooperation that they didn't have before).\n\nSome of the cases with neo-nazis are fabricated for propaganda purposes, however Putin condemns any and all of these cases openly, I'm not sure why you would blame this on Putin when he has always been against anything of that nature. \n\nFor all of you calling him a dictator, check this: http://rt.com/politics/russian-poll-monitoring-monitors-815/ \n\nShow me any other election in the world which had cameras everywhere, along with international observers to make sure the election is going ok.\n\nI am Brasilian and I support Russia and Putin(I also support the U.S).

" I don't know how old you are, but I remember being in my teens and very worried about this stuff because the scientists of the time pushed hard at us that we were all going to \"freeze in the dark\".  (There was an actual ad campaign with this message warning us of the impending global cooling crisis.)   Maybe you're my age and you've managed to keep faith in these people over the years, or maybe you're a teen who is getting this thrown at you for the first time, so you're taking it all very seriously, but after years of doomsday prophecies from these people, you start to lose faith.  I've been hearing global warming/global cooling/climate change scaremongering for the last 40 years.  And each time I hear about how the world is going to end.  Yet it doesn't. (And it's not limited to these folks - Avian flu is a great example of another scientific scare that ended up being nothing.)  Each time the public was told to trust in these scientists.  That the science and logic behind this was irrefutable and we needed to act quickly.  And each time, we pretty much ignored it and nothing happened.  \n\nSo, who knows?  Maybe this round of it is correct.  Maybe this time it really will happen and maybe this time it's not just about funding, or getting published, or whatever.  (And I don't dispute that people get into science for the love of science, but the folks who manage the labs are not, for the most part, scientists.  They are guys in suits with MBAs and their job is to secure funding.  And some honestly don't give a crap about the science, they just want to succeed at their jobs and move on to something bigger and better.)  Maybe this time we really are all in some real trouble and it's not just a bunch of folks teaming with media to sell newspapers and get grant money.  But I've heard the alarm bell raised one too many times to buy into it again.  \n\n"

Fear sells, and sadly, some of these folks are not above using that fear (or even fraud) to boost their budget.  You can't tell me it doesn't go on, and you can't tell me that when someone finds a \"vein\" that can be mined in the scientific community that some groups don't flock to it like a moth to flame looking to get in on the free cash.

Poland was able to keep its rates low and it survived, but if the PIIGS countries were able to what they did in such a way that the EU bankers didn't know the extent of the issue. If Greece is able to take on massive amounts of debt without the people who regulate their currency knowing that it's a problem, then they are not ready for a united currency. People in 2002 thought they would be able to regulate and prevent a crisis, but they didn't know the kind of structural problems they were looking for.\n\nThe Euro was actually wildly successful at bringing high tech industry to peripheral nations, so from 2002-07 it fit the needs of the continent.

"There are so many weird assumptions in you argument that need to be unpacked. The oddest is \"it is that pleasure for which they have to pay.\"\n\nThe idea that a positive experience must necessarily have a cost is quintessential of market and exchange based reasoning. There are modes of human interaction that do not involve exchange and there is no reason to introduce when all that is being traded is information. The best example is family. A child owes a debt to his parents that cannot truly be repaid for raising and providing for him, and in the few instances where compensation has been demanded, it effectively ends the familial relationship. A child caring for their elderly parents is not an exchange for the years the parents invested in the child, it is an implicit responsibility that can not be made commensurable with the actions of the parents.\n\nExchange works best for commodities, and information, by its nature, resists commoditisation. The idea that Dostoevsky and Camus can be made commensurable without discarding the actual utility of either is plainly absurd. Because information can be copied without a proportionate investment of labour any exchange value it has is entirely based on artificial scarcity. As I stated in my other reply criticising the assumptions your arguments make, the exchange value and use value of creative works exist in direct contradiction, attempting to bolster one demolishes the other. Introducing a fiat that intellectual property is basic and inviolable crushes any use to society that the information in question may have had."

Meanwhile, the reason so many immigrants work in Switzerland is because only ~16% of Swiss go to college, and the boom in high-tech industries requires highly skilled workers. In the few years I've been living there, very few people in high-ranking positions, academic or corporate, are actually Swiss. The majority are foreign. "

I would argue that we've done a hell of a lot more to them. Our governments ( those things that supposedly represent us which while is arguably not true, is still seen that way many) have been responsible for the iraq war lower estimates are 100000 dead the majority being civilians), the Afghan war (god knows how many dead and how many Afghans even know why we are there), not mention how we (Brits and French) drew the borders for many middle eastern countries back in the 20's and installed puppet governments to bend to our will, Israel (not much needs to be said, its a huge area of conflict and the French and Brits were paramount in beginning the issue). The west as a collective has probably killed more, destroyed more and caused far more terror in the last 200 yeas than the Islamic world has done to us and get people are still surprised they hate us. \n\nNot at all saying the Islamic world is an angel however. But I find it absurd that if you look at most interpretations of history there is no way you can come to the conclusion that the west has been attacked and hurt more. \n\n\nAnd you should never measure our actions against someone elses.

We can project this authority effectively outside our borders; this is the difference between \"powerful\" nations, except electronically.

"Emotional investment &gt; reason. Until we evolve to a state where our frontal lobes are a little bigger, we're always going to be moved by 2 levers, self interest and fear. When we sit and listen to people tell us they know what is good for us and we invest all that time and energy into supporting them, we will defend until we can no longer talk their agenda and the narrative they have given us. Don't even bother going against the herd, they will just trample you and convince themselves strength in numbers is somehow the moral way to address something.\n"
"Discriminatory: the unjust or prejudicial treatment of different categories of people or things, esp. on the grounds of race, age, or sex.\n\nNeither men nor women are being *treated* differently here.  Both men and women are being treated the same by this policy.  The outcome may be different, but based on the definition I'm reading (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination), it is the treatment that counts, not the outcome.  But I'm willing to stipulate that looking at the outcome serves a higher purpose than just the treatment.  So, let's look further.\n\nNow, the concern you express that this policy \"puts unjust pressure on women to adhere to conservative gender norms in order to avoid inconveniencing their families.\" is only correct if there is no other solution within their means.  In the case where there is an incentive to synchronize surnames, and a desire to avoid conservative gender norms, the couple has the ability to change both their names to whatever they may desire, be it his, hers or some hybrid.  The only thing that would stop them both from changing their names, is, ironically, sexism.  Yes, it is inconvenient to change your name, but women have been doing this for more than a century, the mechanism is well oiled.  A man could do it just as easily as a woman.  The most likely reason a couple wouldn't both change their names is that the husband would be embarrassed to do so.  Which, if he expects his wife to do so under these circumstances, is sexist.  \n\nAll that aside, to expect the world around them to create mechanisms to accommodate a small minority of families is unreasonable.   (I'm reading that 90%+ of women take their husband's last names and that this number is climbing. - http://www.policymic.com/articles/48711/should-you-take-your-husband-s-last-name   http://www.livescience.com/16813-women-husband.html).  If a couple has decided not to take each other's names (as my wife and I decided), they need to understand that they are a minority and that the world will not accommodate them simply because they choose not to avail themselves of existing solutions.  \n\n "

"It is funny that you mention the european project because it has already been achieved. the \"Europe of nations\" was intented to prevent future wars between members by making them economically dependent on each others. the EU is only the third incarnation of this project, which has been tremendeously successful: no one in europe now believes that a war could possibly happen between member states, or even between europe and most of the world (even the good ol' \"Russians are coming\" is losing steam), even in the long term. Defense budget ratios are at an all-time low and people are just asking for more reductions. This is an absolute world first and the direct result of this European project.\n\nNow, the issue is that this economic union, and the framework of political union that was built around it, is introducing a lot of practical management problems, mostly because countries still have different policy traditions. So the future is not really to make the EU a single country, but to harmonize policies on a wide range of topics so that the gears keep turning even during an economic crisis. I don't believe nations will be relinquishing their sovereignty anytime soon."

That's reducing casualties by best case scenario into half. In addition no risk to pilots.

"You are looking at this completely wrong and in my opinion WAY to narrowly. I am not going to argue for or against the NSA. Nor will I argue for or against counter terrorist actions. I will argue that the view that since your chance of being killed by a terrorist is small then its not a big deal. \n\nWhat you have to realize is your view is shockingly narrow and myopic. \n\nYou brought up 9/11 so I will discuss it briefly. You are absolutely correct in saying that on the scale of the US population the attacks where \"not that huge\". I won't say that callous because your viewing, and correct me if I am wrong from detached objective view. However this is where you veer of course into dangerous waters.\n\nThe attacks have way more things involved then deaths. \n\n1. In the immediate aftermath you have BILLIONS of dollars worth of destruction. That's  thousands of people losing their lively hood. The children of the victims, the children of the first responders all losing paychecks that where feeding them. The people that worked in those building and the surrounding area as well all lost their jobs and their lively hood all because of that \"Not A Big Deal\".\n\n2. The Economy collapses. This is a very big deal. Especially the stock market. Now I realize that this is /worldnews so some will instantly say screw wall street but this is not just big bankers, we are talking pension funds for teachers, firefighters, Police, Secretaries, all the way down to Government level employees and janitors. Everyone loses their ass and your awesome retirement that you worked for 60 years is gone in a second over that \"Not a Big Deal\". \n\n3. The population does not feel safe anymore. This feeds into the second point a lot. With the Stock Market going nuts people are scared to invest, companies don't know wether to hire anymore. Everything goes haywire. It gets worse though. Airlines suffer, SO's don't want their SO's to go on long trips, This slows down international trade which slows down the world economy and causes serious economic worries. Worries all about that \"Not a Big Deal\".\n\nIt can be argued that the number one job of any government is to make sure the population feels safe. Be it economic safety, physical safety, religious safety, or social safety. And guess what a terrorist attack hits a grand slam on almost all of those. \n\n\nAny government has to take seriously any major attack not just because people die, But because it can have serious ruinous economic and social impact that is ALWAYS worse then the body count.\n"

The defendants agreed to a plea deal where they pled guilty to a felony that would end up getting reduced to a misdemeanor if they stayed out of any serious legal trouble until next December, and they had to pay $5k in restitution to PayPal. This was a pretty good deal, considering they were being charged under the CFAA and were eligible for a felony and 15 years in prison and 250k+ in restitution.\n\nFor reference, here's one of the leading attorneys in that case, Stanley Cohen, defending the PayPal14's actions. \n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OxySG_9jtQ"

"Okay...   Listen carefully...\n\nMany NSA surveillance devices do *not* communicate over the internet, because doing so would be to easy to detect.   Instead they only send data when \"illuminated\" by a continuous wave \"radar\".\n\nBasicly, the NSA plants a hidden device in a computer, power lead, keyboard etc.   Then they fire a radio signal from a distance of a few miles at it, and the device exfiltrates data by slightly reflecting the radio wave, which is then picked up by the NSA agents.   Sometimes to hide themselves, they will set up 2 levels of this scheme so information is being relayed by an innocent bystander to the real target.\n\n\nBecause these devices have such a long range, anyone with the right hardware in the same city as the spy network ought to be able to pinpoint where the signals are coming from and being reflected from - ie. they can identify the target of the spying.   All you need is a spectrum analyzer and patience to look for very precise very narrow bandwidth signals that get digitally amplitude modulated.  Example hardware [here](http://www.spiegel.de/static/happ/netzwelt/2014/na/v1/pub/img/Tastatur/S3224_SURLYSPAWN.jpg).  The same hardware can be combined with malware to transmit to the NSA, like [here](http://www.spiegel.de/static/happ/netzwelt/2014/na/v1/pub/img/Server_HP/S3222_IRONCHEF.jpg)\n\nWhen you find the target, go and knock on their door with a directional detector tuned to the right frequency and offer to find it for them.   Remember they might be the innocent bystander, but make sure you post results on reddit.    The NSA should be scared shitless at their targets being alerted by the public that they are a specific target, and hence will probably stop using the whole system."

"Au contraire, they are being eerily silent on the subject. Is already happening. I'm a farmer from Alaska. In 2012, the ozone hole went from 30% gone ( or a 60% increase in uv rays) to 40% gone ( or an 80% incr. in uv) to in October of 2012 80% gone, ( a 160% incr in uv). This was such a dramatic increase that plants which have evolved for hundreds of thousands of years cannot change that fast and they all had uv burn. The entire forest went crispy. ( look p Richard black, bbc news, arctic ozone hole , April, 2012, and October 2012. He's the only one who covered this event. No press release from our govt.) so if you look up what happens if the entire northen boreal forest were to die, (and it would if they didnt start spraying like crazy, every sunny day up there....every single one....), you'd see the one humongous forest hold 703 Pg of carbon (15 zeros) enough to double the co2 in our atmosphere, taking it to 800 ppm, which ...well....look at what 'just'  400 ppm is doing. Seven feedback loops already in motion. ( you tube video, guy Mac Pherson, \" the twin side of the fossil fuel coin\").

What dog owners witness is a small and furry version of the aurora borealis and a link between species and environment that’s as holistic and beautiful as a dog pooping can be. A team of Czech and German researchers found that dogs actually align themselves with the Earth’s magnetic field when they poop.\n\n&gt; Proving at least that they’re really devoted to their work, the researchers measured the direction of the body axis of 70 dogs from 37 breeds during 1,893 defecations and 5,582 urinations over the course of two years, and found that dogs “prefer to excrete with the body being aligned along the North-south axis under calm magnetic field conditions.” They fittingly published their results in the journal Frontiers in Zoology.\n"

I can't speak with any real certainty, but I imagine that many Americans despise terrorists for a multitude of reasons including giving our government an excuse to throw our rights out the window and also considering terrorists generally want to see Americans die horrible, grisly deaths in their pursuit to appease their god.\n\nSo, we don't like it when our government has to deal with these pricks because it is messy and disruptive, not so much that we love the terrorists. It makes us look bad when things go wrong, as they inevitably do in any large conflict and that sucks.\n\nBut now Russia is getting involved!

We get to watch our Russian friends blow the ever loving shit out of some terrorists at least, so we might as well kick back and enjoy it. \n\nHonestly, in situations like this there isn't much more one can do. Maybe, just maybe, if enough people die and things ruined both sides will lose their thirst for blood. While it isn't likely, it might change things for a little while.\n\nOnly time will tell.

They did not inform the rescue crew and instead allowed them to become contaminated. This wasn't admitted publicly for nearly 2 years and it took the crew members reporting strange cancer and illnesses linked to radiation poisoning. Also, the crew was so contaminated that no country would allow them to dock for 2 months! Why the fuck didn't the public know about this?\n\nAnd, what REALLY pisses me the fuck off, is that NSA+Trapwire=Unlimited Access to Information.

So, at least in our system, no one particular cell is the permanent residence of the prisoner. I suppose this is the trap of becoming institutionalised, it is not his or her home (merely a suspension of freedom to call anywhere such), but it comes to feel like it should be. \n\nAlso, thank you too, it's all too rare that I have such an interesting and well mannered exchange on Reddit.

Not to take away from Tom Mulciar because he has been hammering away at the Conservatives but the liberal (claiming) party leader seems to benefit most from the NDP's punches. Don't get me wrong about the liberal (claiming) party they know how to politics choosing Justin Trudeau who's father was Pierre Trudeau one of the greatest prime ministers. Until there is another conservative party to contest and split the votes the liberals won't win even with their pro pot stance, and no way in hell I'm voting a liberal (claiming) party when they won't show their budget plans.

My son didnt believe me till last June at colony days in Palmer. One jet had a chemtrails which was , if you held your arm all the way out, three inches wide . Then it just abruptly stopped, and the plane flew away. It had put 11 chemtrails lines in the sky, from the horizon ( mts where we were) to directly overhead. Then stopped. They do this every day now. The chemicals spread out , create a haze in an hour or so, then full on clouds. My crops failed and we will sell the farm this summer, as I don't see it getting any better. If the sun is out the trees burn ( apple) and if they spray like they do, there isn't enough sun to bring on the size for sale.

"You're missing the point and making excuses that don't appreciate the perspective of the person being offended. \n\nTo cite an example. One of the reasons the Middle East is so unstable is a lack of nationalism. The borders drawn by western powers at the end of World War 1 and World War 2 didn't appreciate existing ethnic boundaries. The ethno-centric nations which individuals in that region would normally be a member of (Think about France, Germany, the Czech Republic, and nearly every other European country.) have no logical basis. Religion, whether or not you like it, becomes a much bigger part of their lives for some people because of this. It is part of the identity they cling to.\n\nCyridius's point is that because of various factors, followers of Islam put their own personal identity much more closely to their religion than Christians, and that makes jokes about them much more offensive. I'm all for free speech when it comes to the *government*, but there is a consideration of offense on the part of the individual, that's human. Cyridius cited the example of a white comedian making fun of black people and using the n-word, which never happens, and a major part of that is an attack on identity. I think it's a rather apt comparison. You may not see it as equivalent, but you're an internet commentator."

With the rise of Shenzhen next door, increasing infrastructure links with the mainland and fusion of the two cities, hong kong will eventually lose its autonomy.

You are one person among 300 million. And there's probably some guy in there that for whatever reason wants pretty much all the opposite things you want.

"&gt; People stop working shitty jobs and as much\n\nI wouldn't be so sure people with shitty jobs will stop working entirely. There would still be an incentive to have more money than the basic income, i.e. an incentive to work. Maybe those with shitty jobs simply wouldn't work as much as they did before. Maybe that would even open up positions for more people to work the same (shitty) job thus reducing unemployment."
"An interesting comment on the source site, TechChrunch:\n\n&gt;Check the date on the documents. 10/01/2008.\nAt this time, the current iOS version was 2.1. iOS security landscape was a *very* different place back then. Jailbreaks were very simple. The iPhone bootrom did not even signature check the firmware. Now, the iPhone is incredibly secure and modern jailbreaks require 6-10 separate, obscure exploits. The latest jailbreak requires physical device access, passcode to be disabled, and the device to \"trust\" the computer, since it works over AFC.\n\n&gt;The chance that these NSA tools work on today's iOS6/7 devices is almost 0%. The NSA can't flash their own firmware either, since the Bootrom now does SHA1+ RSA1024bit signature checking of the firmware.\n\n\n"
"/u/wazzel2u said:\n\n&gt; Actually 30 years ago we were supposed to be afraid of a fast coming ice-age.\n\nLike /u/strum says, media coverage is not scientific consensus. [Here is a mroe detailed explaination:](http://skepticalscience.com/ice-age-predictions-in-1970s.htm)\n\n&gt; The fact is that around 1970 there were 6 times as many scientists predicting a warming rather than a cooling planet. Today, with 30+years more data to analyse, we've reached a clear scientific consensus: 97% of working climate scientists agree with the view that human beings are causing global warming."

"I have spent a lot of time researching and reading up on Fukushima over the past year and half. Honestly, I think there is no real way to know how bad the situation is. There IS a media black out, which means when researching the subject you are constantly swimming through propaganda and fear mongering. \n\nIf reactor 3 was currently melting down and a cloud of radioactive plume was headed to the pacific north west, the public would be kept in the dark.\n\nI'll use the USS Ronald Regan story for my example. TEPCO was aware of the leak, knew the water was radioactive, and chose to remain silent as rescue crews were sent out on humanitarian aid missions. The crew became contaminated with radiation and the ship was not allowed to dock for 2 months. The crew members are now reporting serious illnesses linked to radiation poisoning.\n\nhttp://nypost.com/2013/12/22/70-navy-sailors-left-sickened-by-radiation-after-japan-rescue/\n\nOk. So, it took nearly 2 years for Tepco to admit publicly that they knew the water was radioactive. It wasn't until crew members began reporting illnesses with well known blogs (I even saw someone in /r/news claiming to be a crew member on one of the ships,)  did the MSM pick this story up.\n\n"

"BitCoin can do it because there aren't that many messages sent, and you want to inform people that you've sent and/or received something (verification).\n\nFor truly anonymous email, the recipient needs to be encrypted as well as the content (otherwise metadata analysis works just as well as before), so you need everyone to pass on your message (for a certain amount of time), and in return you need to pass their messages on as well.\n\nAnd you can't just remove your message from the data pool when it has been received either, as that would tell the people you're connecting with which message you received, and they already know which messages you sent (but not the content or the recipient, both of which needs to be kept secret).\n\nThis makes for a rather complicated situation, because if the recipient is encrypted, need to download the entire message to figure out if the message is for you. You could send it in partitions, but then you have to request the remaining parts of the message, and others can then figure out who sent you something.\n\nSuppose for a moment that there are one billion people on the Internet. Suppose that on average they send ten emails a day. How keen are you on downloading ten billion emails a day? If each mail was just one byte, that's ten gigabytes of data. If it's a more realistic 500kB, it's 5 petabyte of data. All to get your ten emails.\n"

Worldwide 30-40% of the plankton are \"gone\" and in some places like calif, its 70% gone. Is that catastrophic? What about the \" unusual mortality event\" this summer in sea lions? 1000 of them dead. Was that catastrophic? How about the sardines which \" didn't show up\" as the news put it....catastrophic? The herring off Canada, every one with bleeding sores...dying...catastrophic? Orcas with a large percent (unusual) die off...and silent now...catastrophic? Seabird populations, polar bears and seals with what looks like radiation sores, starfish gone in a month or so...even the tide pools have hardly any snails now. My point is ...at what point do you see the oceans are dying, and yes it IS a catastrophe ...and no our govt is NOT talking about it. The entire world is silent  on this ( I'm talking govts here not env. Organizations) . The plankton make half the oxygen we breathe. They are dying. Even if we stopped every motor today, the oceans would continue to acidifying for decades, and its already so acidic that some stratified water will kill plankton in 15 minutes.

"I don't care what people worship as long as it doesn't impact me. Someone's race doesn't impact me. Someone's faith however does, because for some reason we're expected to make special accommodations because people want to believe in things they cannot prove nor verify in the slightest.\n\nHere's a good way to look at it:\n\nImagine a man, we'll call him Jeremy. He sincerely believes that at ten minutes to two, every day, he must disrobe but for a sock and perform the song Gangnam style, complete with dance and all the jiggling and wiggling that would entail. He's utterly convinced that if he doesn't do this, a Psy look-a-like will be waiting at his flat with a cricket bat with which to batter him when he goes home.\n\nNow, Jeremy asks a prospective employer if he'll be allowed to complete his daily bare-arsed performance in the office. The employer, understandably, declines and tells Jeremy that perhaps he shouldn't insist on this personal ritual.\n\nBut wait! Jeremy pulls out a slightly battered, leather-bound, neon pink book! The title is clearly religious, and he points to the passage demanding that he perform the song daily, naked but for a sock!\n\nSuddenly, instead of declining someone because they've asked something unreasonable and crazy, the employer has discriminated based on religion! Oh no! He'll likely have to provide a special room for Jeremy to do his dance in, and give him an extra break of around five minutes depending on Jeremy's sense of beat and time.\n\nEnd.\n\nThis is what I disagree with. This is why I believe religion is open to criticism. This is what many of the faithful believe to be their 'right' - Special treatment based on the often crazy demands their religion places on them. That should not be the case. No baseless idea should be granted such power to distort society.\n\nJust because someone identifies personally with an idea doesn't put it above reproach. Yes, I understand they'd feel more offended, but my point is that their supposed right to avoid being offended is trumped by my right to be critical and speak freely. \n\nIn short? If you make your faith a public matter, by demanding special treatment or proselytizing, be prepared for it to be criticised. "
"What is it with this fixation for dumb mob mentality? It would not be any better if George Bush was elected 'democratically' as Governor of Hong Kong. Whether a leader is chosen by a small group or large group, at least the small group is probably more qualified to choose a more capable guy that doesn't exhibit profound retardation. Leaders in the west don't have to answer to the dumb masses either, they safely ignore their squeals and protests as they squander the economy for lobby group interests. Nobody is squandering hong kong prosperity, least of all Beijing which is interested in keeping it growing into perpetuity."
"That’s pretty much what Putin’s PR wants you to think of him. They’ve done a good job of making whole Russia think so for a while.\n\nPutin can’t resolve any problems with Caucasian region for more than decade. His approach is basically two things:\n\n1. Television and press was forbidden to talk about acts of terror. Most of press is controlled by state or Putin’s accolades, so the default approach is “this never happened”. No one remembers huge acts of terror such as Moscow metro bombings (this happened multiple times with huge casualties) or music festival bombing. Most russians can’t even remember what metro stations were bombed. Absolutely no coverage of Moscow theater hostage crisis, when more than 100 hostages were killed. It was televised by a channel that was severely punished afterwards. After that Putin learnt a lesson, and to this day there is zero TV or media coverage honoring the memories of Beslan victims (enormous act of terror, when more than thousand children were taken hostage, and in the result more than 300 children were killed). There was more information on this act of terror in american Esquire than all russian media combined.\n\n2. In the early 2000’s Putin negotiated a “kind of” peace with part of chechen rebels, and one of them (Kadyrov and his family) was unofficially given a free pass to do anything he'd like in the region and outside of it in exchange of stopping guerrilla warfare. It is debatable if it can be accounted as peace, since there were tons of acts of terror and bombings since, and Kadyrov (the person who apparently coined the phrase: “I’ve killed the first Russian when I was 15”) is basically the second most powerful person in Russia behind Putin. This grew to Caucausus being de-facto an outlaw zone - for example, most of hijacked cars are transferred to Ingushetia (small region bordering Chechnya) where police (which is basically terrorists who switched under Kadyrov’s protection) changes cars’ VIN numbers. Most of rich Caucasians who even remotely have access to any of Kadyrov's accolades are under protection of russian courts and police and can do any crime imaginable in the european part of the country. There is a huge debate in Russia society, when a majority of russians support the separation of Caucausus, but Putin forbids discussion of it in media and recently issued a law that sentences anyone discussing it to under five years in prison.\n\nBasically it's not Putin vs. terror deathmatch. It's more like \"how to make (with lies or terror) people think like that\"."

"Movements need to start somewhere. This month a few thousand, next month maybe more. People tend to not want to be the first to speak up, but when someone else does; they become more willing to.

"&gt; You're free to believe that the solutions are beyond the reach of science, but that makes you a mystic.\n\nTo believe a problem is unsolvable by science -- or unfeasible to solve, or too unpalatable to solve -- does not make you a mystic.\n\n 1. Some problems really are unsolvable. One of the (very) long term problems humanity faces is entropy and the universe's progression towards thermodynamic equilibrium. Not a single qualified scientist will tell you that entropy is \"solvable\".\n 2. Some problems are beyond the reach of scientific understanding (or the will of the society to develop) within the timeframe they occur. The Puebloan civilization of the American southwest came to an end due to topsoil erosion and the drawing down of water sources. Could they have solved the problem with appropriate technology? Yes. Were they advanced enough/foresighted enough to develop and implement these solutions? No.\n 3. Sometimes a solution exists but is more expensive to implement than the downsides of not implementing it. Engineers have developed supersonic passenger aircraft, but their increased cost and the externality of sonic booms killed them on the free market.\n\nTo the contrary, I accuse you of argument from faith. The belief that humanity -- without having to plan ahead -- will naturally and painlessly resolve any challenges that it creates for itself, is as logically sound as an economist jumping into a well with the assurance that his human cleverness and economic demand for sustenance will allow him to produce food there."

I'm not here to get into the philosophy of if good and evil exist or something with you, but facts are facts. The British obtained Hongkong by force and via a time-limited lease so they could use it to smuggle opium.

"well for starters, Hong Kong people have a lot more rights. These rights are accorded by the HK's Constitution known as the Basic Law, which was the product of negotiations between China and UK before the take-over in 1997. In essence, before the take-over, HKers were afraid that HK will become subsumed under China and lose all their rights. So UK, on behalf of HK, negotiated with China to establish HK as a Special Administrative Region to have its own independent legal system. These are guaranteed under the HK constitution, which the Chinese Government tends to respect (although the HK constitution arguably is a piece of legislation under the Chinese Constitution).\n\nAlso contained in the HK Constitution is a provision which provides that: \"The ultimate aim is the selection of the Chief Executive by universal suffrage upon nomination by a broadly representative nominating committee in accordance with democratic procedures\".  - which is what the procession today is all about.\n\nBut to be honest, the HK Constitution also provides that the Chief Executive must be accountable to the Central People's Government (Art 43). And notwithstanding elections, he/she would have to be appointed by China (Art 45). Really, the Chief Executive is destined to be China's puppet, or at best, a mediator between Hong Kong and China.\n\nIn relation to your question, HK is already part of China. The Chinese government has his henchman as the Chief Executive of HK, so all socio-political policies are influenced by the Communist Party. The only thing that really differs between HK and China is the protection and awareness of rights: freedom of speech, press etc. If the Communist Party completely took over HK (which won't happen because that basically means revoking the HK constitution), then all these rights will be eroded away. HK people are currently making full use of these rights as a channel to vent their anger. IMO, the HK people's struggle is of noble futility. It is to delay the inevitable hegemony that China has. HK's economy depends on China, and that will be the final say on all matters: ultimately, HK people need China to put food on their table. They just, rightly, want their rights to be respected.\n\nObjectively speaking, China is already quite deferential to HK. The Chinese govt gave HK some part of the olympics, encouraged policies which boosted HK's economy and interfered with HK at a minimal level. HK people just know they have a right to protest and love to make good use of it (and so they shall!).\n"

America also has the largest prison population in the world. American intelligence agencies operate black prisons in countries like poland. There are also well known prisons like in Guantanamo Bay. \n\n* **THIRDLY: CHINA'S REALESTATE BUBBLE IS THE RESULT OF A FLOURISHING MIDDLE CLASS USING REAL ESTATE AS INVESTMENT PROPERTY TO BE TRADED** This fact is one I'm well aware of, considering I work with people in the field.

"Slow and subtle changes. First facebook, youtube and twitter would disappear to most it would appear that they had been pushed out by Mainland companies (Sina Weibo, Renren, Tencent) when in fact, just like in China, government pressure pushed them out.\n\nThen as free media slowly disappeared you'd end up with a generation who, like many young Mainland Chinese people, completely support the Red Party and are hugely patriotic; who don't remember a time before them and who are educated to believe that the corruption and inequality in China are a requirement to maintain growth and stability and not caused by the political system.\n\nYou'd see poor homeowners have their homes taken away from them and moved without their consent in favour of big government backed developers, often with little or no compensation.\n\nThe protests would stop and turn into rallies, children would march to the Chinese national anthem while performing flag raising ceremonies in primary school, sometimes even in kindergarten.\n\nTravel would become restricted as people have to present identification simply to buy train tickets, on long distance coaches an employee would board before it left the station and take a recording of every person's face.\n\nPerhaps Hong Kong residents would become subject to the Hukou system and their children would not be entitled to education outside of their hometowns.\n\nChecks and balances within their political system would all but disappear, and high-ranking government officials would live above the law. At least until they became an embarrassment to the Red Party, after which they would be tried by the party's own internal court system and summarily executed or imprisoned for life. \n\nEven their language, Cantonese, would slowly be pushed out in favour of Mandarin."

"The problem with that approach is that you are treating the symptoms.  It's the same problem with US drug policy.  Ivory is currently in demand, and as such there will always be people willing to serve that demand, no matter how heinous the crime.\n\nThe only way to solve the problem is to destroy the demand with cultural changes in places like China and also banning the import of the product.  This transition can be eased if we set up legal ivory harvesting to satisfy demand legally.  The issue is that it takes so long to raise an elephant or rhino for harvesting... which by then it will probably be too late for the wild populations.\n\nHumans have done similar things with the fur trade to ease pressures on wild populations of wolves and foxes."

"yea but I can get my celebrity gossip at the same time, science for the labotamised."
"You're a little off here.  Let's start with that logic bit.  Catholics don't choose to be Catholics any more than atheists choose to be atheists.  If it is what they believe in the face of prevailing evidence then they are necessarily Catholics.\n\nOr let's pretend you're right - all those Catholics baptised in infancy and raised to be Catholics have a choice right?  Not really.\n\nYou seem to misunderstand the nature of religion.  You've called it an 'organisation' and a 'business'.  It isn't.\n\nIf you really want to look at logic then check out your sentence starting \"Also, you can...\" It is a self referencing proof and therefore, by definition, invalid.\n\nAs for 'the victims' they're almost to, to a man, Catholics.  They are the people who attended Catholic schools, churches and institutions.  If your logic is correct, they put themselves in harm's way by 'choosing' to belong to that business/organisation. Right?\n"
"They only disperse the protests when they start marching towards where the soldiers are stationed. \n\nObviously rubber bullets contain a tiny amount of steel, since it would have been impossible to shoot them otherwise, but it has nothing to do with the strength of the impact, since the steel \"cap\" is on the back of the bullet.\n\n\nYou make it sound as if there are rubber bullets which do not contain steel, which is something that doesn't exist. \n\n\nTear gas and rubber bullets is how you disperse a mob which is trying to take over a military outpost by force.

"America is behind this."
"Saying that Taiwan is \"backed\" by the U.S. is a bit of a stretch.\n\nThe U.S. doesn't even officially recognize Taiwan as a country. Yes, they tend to cooperate unofficially, but in no way is that some sort of safeguard. To assume that the U.S. would break ties with China to protect Taiwan is a bitch of an assumption."
"Reddit having an agenda would require there to be a single leader entity. More likely this effect is produced by mob mentality and multiple independent groups pushing their agendas. Obvious posts are still called out in high ranking comments, and the individuals on Reddit still have a say in how politics are discussed. Spoofing upvotes for articles with opinions Reddit doesn't agree with won't change people's minds.\n\nAs haydayhayday says, this might be a propaganda battleground. IMHO that's not a bad thing as long as things still get discussed."
"if it is indeed a One Country, Two Systems policy, then why does\n\n- high ranking chinese officials give calls and meet up with the small electoral committee to support a CE candidate?\n\n- high ranking chinese officials keep giving open \"pointers\" in public on how the CE of HK must \"love the country\" and cannot \"act against the chinese central government\", as well as their opinion on various political issues?\n\nThe Chinese government holds a greater right over the Basic Law.  While they cannot just rewrite it anyway they want, they can define what is written and holds the rights to all grey areas.\n\nThe question \"will the Chinese government allow us to do such and such\" is getting tossed around far too often under this one country, two systems banner."

"The fact that they are officially called \"the Republic of China\" is meaningless. Go on any street in Taiwan and ask random people how they feel about China.

And, as a result of the current president's leniency towards China, his approval rating dropped to 7%. Yes, there are of course people in Taiwan who want to reunite with China, in the same way that there are people in the USA who want to secede from the States. It's a vast minority, and it doesn't make my general statement that Taiwan is \"anti-China\" any less true.\n\nI said senate because 99% of people that don't live in Taiwan won't know what the \"legislative yuan\" is (hint: it's a senate, basically).

That's the bad part. The austerity measures that Greece had to take to allow the rest of the U.E. to bail her out were undoubtly harsh, but still better than the pure and simple default that was at stake.\n\nThe option that Greece step out of the Euro, of even completely out of the U.E. *was* considered but quickly rejected. It would have been a hard blow for the E.U. as a whole, and would have left Greece with a devaluated local currency and *a debt still in €*.\n\nNow, as for devaluation. Latvia is a member of the E.U. and has been for twenty years. As such, her currency is already pegged to the Euro, and can fluctuate only within a tiny margin."

"Let me clear the dust on this issue. \n\n**Background**: \n\nThe selection process of Chief Executive (CE) in HK is governed by the HK Constitution, known as the Basic Law. The Basic Law was the product of negotiations between China and UK before the take-over in 1997, in order to ensure that HK would have an independent legal system, would remain free as a capitalistic society for at least 50 years, and would guarantee HK citizens many rights found in human rights conventions such as ICCPR.\n\n**The Law in Question**:\n\nContained in Article 45 of the HK Constitution is a provision which provides that: \"The ultimate aim is the selection of the Chief Executive by universal suffrage upon nomination by a broadly representative nominating committee in accordance with democratic procedures\". \n\n**What the procession is about**:\n\nCurrently, CE is elected by the CE Election Committee, which consists of (in 2012's election) a group of 1200 members either elected from large number of sectors in society i.e. legal, medical, accounting, food, travelling etc, OR other deputies such as the Legislative body members. The Central People's Government (CPG) has significant clout in a number of sectors which indirectly influences on not only the number of genuine candidates for CE and also the ultimate votes. \n\nHK people feel that the provision above should mean that they should have a right to vote for their CE rather than through a election committee influenced by the CPG. The HK people pushed for 2012 universal suffrage which didnt materialise, but hoping that it will happen in 2017.\n\n**What if the Communist Party take over HK**?\n\nThat wont happen. Under the HK Constitution (art 5), China's socialist policies are not to be practiced in HK. And that HK's way of life and capitalist system under the British rule shall remain for at least 50 years from the takeover (2047).\n\nHK citizens' rights are rigorously protected under HK's independent legal system which bequeaths from, and still follows, the British common law system. The Chinese legal system has almost nothing to do with HK's local legal system.\n\n**My humble own take on the issue**:\n\nReally, the Chief Executive is destined to be China's puppet, or at best, a mediator between Hong Kong and China. The HK Constitution provides that the Chief Executive must be accountable to the Central People's Government (Art 43). And notwithstanding elections, he/she would have to be appointed by China (Art 45). \n\nAlso HK is already part of China. The Chinese government has his henchman as the CE of HK, so all socio-political policies are influenced by the Communist Party. The only thing that really differs between HK and China is the protection and awareness of rights: freedom of speech, press etc. If the Communist Party completely took over HK (which won't happen because that basically means revoking the HK constitution), then all these rights will be eroded away. HK people are currently making full use of these rights as a channel to vent their anger. IMO, the HK people's struggle is of noble futility. It is to delay the inevitable hegemony that China has. HK's economy depends on China, and that will be the final say on all matters: ultimately, HK people need China to put food on their table. They just, rightly, want their rights to be respected.\nObjectively speaking, China is already quite deferential to HK. The Chinese govt gave HK some part of the olympics, encouraged policies which boosted HK's economy and interfered with HK at a minimal level. HK people just know they have a right to protest and love to make good use of it (and so they shall!)."

"Let me walk you through the argument as to why this is sexist:\n\n* It may be the case that there is a mutual decision-making process when a woman changes her name, but ultimately it is her name, her decision, her signature on the legal certificate, etc. \n\n\n* Changing your name or not changing your name is your personal decision. It does not make you more or less conservative or feminist whatever you decide. The important thing for fairness is that it is a person's own free decision whether to change their name.\n\n\n* In Western culture, it has historically been the case that women change their name by default, and did not have a choice. Enforcing that is sexist, because it removes the freedom of choice for women.\n\n\n* Companies having policies that _assume_ that married couples have the same last name are implicitly endorsing the premise that all women will change their name rather than respecting that it is an individual choice.\n\n\n* The more complex and inconvenient it is for a woman to keep her name, the more likely she is to just change it to avoid hassle. Reducing the number of women who make this decision freely is thus sexist.\n"

"How does his father die in a gun fight and who said anything about spreading information at the food center. You give out aid unarmed and show them how much you want to help. Then the only way your enemy can violently retaliate is to attack their own people. It forces their hand and makes them resort to nonviolent means of attack or become the common enemy. When they attack their own people, you let their police take care of it and use financial backing if needed to make sure everyone in their country knows they killed hungry Muslim children. If Gahandi was a billionaire philanthropist this would be his tactic.\n\nEdit: Also it would be ideal to make public offerings of food aid to non-violent Muslim leaders to handout. That way you are viewed as a supporter of their religion and culture and the only targets are your sponsored highly admired people in their region. It makes their message harder to spread as public anger builds toward them for attacking or insulting respected people."

Again, you are basing your entire argument on the fact that the country is technically named \"the Republic of China,\" which means nothing. It's called the Republic of China because the KMT in Taiwan was originally considered the legitimate government of China via the United Nations. It literally doesn't have a single thing to do with wanting to be \"with\" China. It means quite the opposite, actually, considering the name spawned from the fact that Taiwan considered themselves the \"real\" China."

Furthermore, “torture can impact a child directly or indirectly. The impact can be due to the child’s having been tortured or detained, **he torture of parents or close family members** or witnessing torture and violence.”\n\nSo all torture is now being construed to be torture of children? That's ridiculous. If you think torture should be illegal say so clearly, don't hide behind a misapplied \"what about the children\".\n\n&gt; Citing this year’s report by Defense of Children International (DCI-Palestine) and Lawyers for Palestinian Human Rights (LPHR), PACTI reiterated that \"Israel is the only nation to automatically and systematically prosecute children in military courts that lack basic and fundamental fair trial guarantees.”\n\nI cannot believe that.

The pope travels to starving countries on his private jet in his 30 grand robes and preaches that they \"will be the richest in heaven\" while claiming to represent Jesus who was big on helping the poor and hungry. It's bullshit.  \n\n\n5. They insist on remaining in the 1940s in regards to their understanding of homosexuality despite there being a massive stack of evidence so support the theory that homosexuality is not only natural but beneficial to the species. This is wrong. \n\n\nI could go on and on but my point is the church long ago lost its monopoly on morality. If the Catholic Church is dumb enough to not recognize when its best to keep their mouth shut (e.g. on subjects like THE WELL BEING OF CHILDREN) then they deserve whatever criticism they get. "

We preserve many good stuff under the british rule, while they are gone after cultural revolution. Outsiders can hardly know the nuance. \n\nEconomically and politically, Hong Kong's value aligns with western countries. Hong Kong has been ranked 1st in economic freedom for many years. Hong Kong has its own currency, which is pegged to US$. Hong Kong dollar is the 13rd most traded currency by value. Although the government is not democratic, the administration  is highly efficient.  Check this out: http://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi/pdf/c97.pdf\nAlso, Hong Kong practises common law which many consider the basis of Hong Kong's prosperity. \n\nThe only reason why Hong Kong does not have democracy is CCP.

"Ok, so since you are incapable of providing even one single quote that supports your conspiracies, I'll try a different approach.\n\nI'm going to just assume you've misunderstood the strategy during the occupation, where once we'd created a giant cesspool of Islamic extremist we treated Iraq as the primary battleground in the War of Terror.  If you could point out where anyone said *prior to the invasion* that we intended to draw in as many extremists to Iraq as possible, that would really go a long way in supporting your case.\n\nBefore the invasion, Iraq was considered a part of the War on Terror because the Bush administration claimed they were a state sponsor of terrorism.  This is different from what you're claiming, since Iraq itself had a very small amount of people we'd call terrorists prior to the invasion.  Given that you're claiming to be basing your views on the stated goals laid out by administration officials, these distinctions are important.\n\nAfter the invasion occurred and the country deteriorated into the massive conflict zone it spent much of the last decade as, there was a new mission to root out the insurgency.  The administration acknowledged that foreigners were pouring in under the banner of al Qaeda (though they often got foggy or simply ignored the distinctions between the Afghan and Iraqi versions of the organization).  Fighting these Islamist extremists as they came into Iraq became an important part of stabilizing Iraq, and any rational person would note that Iraq had become a battleground with the whole region's extremists fighting both against each other and the US occupying forces.  **This is not the same thing as what you're saying.**  After it became a reality, administration officials acknowledged that fact and dealt with it as they saw fit.  I would personally say their solution only made the problem worse, but that's not really relevant at this point.\n\nThe key here is that you don't understand the timeline, and simply saying \"it says so in the memoirs\" is not actually convincing.  It only proves that you read some equally conspiratorial excerpt that was deliberately taken out of context.  I think the content produced by the Bush administration during and since the invasion of Iraq is a gold mine of war crimes, heinous acts, and downright evil.  But I value truth, and think that painting them as masterminds plotting a decade long war is simply wrong.  It lowers the credibility of more serious claims of impropriety.\n\nAs for The Pentagon's New Map, I think you severely misunderstand the whole point of the Leviathan."
"Just look at this \"gem\"  from the article:\n\n&gt; Citing this year’s report by Defense of Children International (DCI-Palestine) and Lawyers for Palestinian Human Rights (LPHR), PACTI reiterated that \"**Israel is the only nation** to automatically and systematically prosecute children in military courts that lack basic and fundamental fair trial guarantees.”\n\nReally?\" Israel is the only nation\"? Not North Korea or Syria... \n\nAfter reading stuff like this, it's hard to take anything the article says seriously. "
"I'm inclined to disagree. I will admit that to a certain extent, there is a superiority complex toward those from the mainland however it is a stretch too far to insinuate that cultural tensions exist primarily, as you insinuate, from envy as the socio-economic gaps close between Hong Kong and China. The fact of the matter is, superiority complex or not, there are intrinsic cultural differences (e.g. those that have arisen from the introduction of western institutions such as freedom of speech, rule of law etc.) that have been fostered over more than a century of separate development from the mainland.  \n\n"
"Even if you don't die, getting shot by a rubber bullet can cause serious damage;\n\n&gt; [Such](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_bullet) \"kinetic impact munitions\" are meant to cause pain but not serious injury.

In recent years it has openly attempted to prevent the regular, scheduled demonstrations by Palestinian, Israeli and foreign activists against the construction of the Separation Barrier and against the encroachment of settlements onto Palestinian lands. The measures used by the military to this end include the declaration of protest venues closed military zones; the declaration of demonstrations unlawful; the arrest of protest leaders; and **the extensive use of crowd control means to disperse even nonviolent demonstrations.**"

So now massive demonstrations are being held whereby the head of the opposition has called for strikes which prevent public transports from operating, prevent traveling from one city to another, disrupt businesses and education and cause downright chaos on the streets (for example i had to hire an ambulance to travel to the airport). These disruptions have greatly revealed the autocratic tyrannical nature of the Awami League as they have resorted to brute force and threats to quell the riots which have greatly aided in the support for their removal.

"Ethnicity and language do not necessarily define culture. To quote wikipedia: \n\n&gt;Switzerland comprises four main linguistic and cultural regions: German, French, Italian and the Romansh-speaking valleys. Therefore the Swiss, although predominantly German-speaking, do not form a nation in the sense of a common ethnic or linguistic identity; rather, the strong sense of identity and community is founded on a common historical background, shared values such as federalism and direct democracy and Alpine symbolism.\n\nThat being said, the article goes on to describe the cultural diversity of Switzerland in some detail, and it does indicate that there are a variety of cultural factions within the Swiss people. So with that, you are probably right, although I would still argue that the USA is still home to a wider range of cultures that sometimes hold seemingly incompatible values. I don't, however, have anything more than anecdotal evidence to back that up.\n\nStill, I believe the physically small size of the country and the small population are pretty effective arguments against generalizing the success of Switzerland to the USA. But the burden of proof isn't for me (or anyone for that matter) to have to prove why it shouldn't work, but rather on those who think that it would work to indicate *why,* instead of simply saying \"if it works for them, it can work for us.\" That's not true. If it was true, Afghanistan would have a highly functioning democratic government that is ruled by the will of the people, *because if it works for America it can work for them!* That's what the USA was thinking when they installed a democratic government there in ~2001, and that's exactly the kind of generalist thinking that gets the USA in trouble. Countries, cultures, and economies *are* different; its indisputable, and that kind of thinking that simply doesn't work.\n"

"The truth is protests happen on a very regular basis in Hong Kong, its almost part of the culture. There are protests nearly every weekend in the city, but among these are a number of major ones - the New Year's being one, another on June 4th (anniversary of the Tienanmen Massacre 1989), and July 1st, the anniversary date of Hong Kong's handover from Britain and a public holiday. These attract somewhere between 50,000 and 300,000 demonstrators normally. One should note, however, that the protests aren't just about democracy, but about a plethora of different issues. Anyone who is discontent with the establishment might join, and some even join for the hell of it. The reality is that pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong have become so regular that yes, the social and cultural shock value had already been very much lost, or at least eroded. The big protest that is attracting significant attention, however, is the Occupy Central (Hong Kong's business district) protests slated for this summer, similar to the Occupy Wall Street movement in many ways but instead to push for democracy in HK. Organizers hope they a turnout of significant size that will cause enough disruption might be what is needed to finally bring a democratic system in the near future. \n\nEdit: June 4th, not May 4th"

While freedom of speech endures as a worthwhile idea and so should be defended, even when uncomfortable, the second amendment has lapsed as something worth upholding. \n\nGun ownership among the civilian population has not benefited the citizens of the US since subsistence hunting was a necessary part of life. So why defend something that clearly makes the country weaker?\n\nAnyway the story here is we simply have a company that smelts lead, and since it never got around to changing and now is going the way of the horse and buggy.

During the Cold War, America sought to prevent the Soviet Union from expanding politically, economically, or militarily. The belief was that the Soviet Union would need to expand or else face collapse. The United States does not want to see China collapse. On the contrary, we want it to grow both economically and politically, albeit in a peaceful way. That's the point of our military presence: to deter China from pursuing its lofty territorial ambitions."

To quote wikipedia:\n&gt;Switzerland comprises four main linguistic and cultural regions: German, French, Italian and the Romansh-speaking valleys. Therefore the Swiss, although predominantly German-speaking, do not form a nation in the sense of a common ethnic or linguistic identity; rather, the strong sense of identity and community is founded on a common historical background, shared values such as federalism and direct democracy and Alpine symbolism.\n\nEverybody is debating one point that I made (the cultural homogeneity of Switzerland) and most of their arguments are based on the languages - which isn't the defining factor here. Simply because Switzerland is diverse does not mean their political/economic outcomes would translate to other diverse countries in the way we see them manifested in their small country. The world is more complicated than that. "

"&gt;China would be foolish to make any major moves because of the overpowering US presence in the Pacific, so they won't make a move at all.\n\nNations have been foolish throughout history. Economic interdependence and political rationality are oftentimes outweighed by nationalism or the desire to save face (see World War One or Fukushima today). East Asian relations are chock full of nationalistic tendencies and very sensitive historical grievances--World War Two still plays a crucial part in most Asian countries' relations with Japan, for example. Vietnam still resents the role  China played with its Sinocentric \"Mandate From Heaven\"\n\nIn any event, the Japanese are intent to maintain their sovereignty. Many officials in Tokyo question how committed the United States is to upholding its end of the mutual defense agreement between both countries. Japan has nationalistic and economic interests in preventing the Chinese from seizing the Senkaku Islands. America? Would D.C. *really* risk conflict with China over what most of their constituents believe to be glorified rocks? The question is especially pertinent given the fact that America has no official position of the status of the islands. So while Japan seems to by and large believe our commitment to regional stability, there is a feeling of \"just in case\" present as well.\n\nEdit: Japan is also the 3rd largest economy in the world. Many believe that the one of the problems preventing Japan from ascending to its rightful place in the global order is the self-imposed restrictions on what it can or cannot do with the JSDF. By reclaiming the military, Shinzo Abe is sending a message to the world: \"Japan intends to be a global player in the coming decades. It's not fair for us to be pigeon-holed over the mistakes made by our predecessors.\"\n\n"

"&gt;I'm not saying drones are the answer all the time, but you obviously haven't fleshed out the operational \"cost\" as well as you think you have.\n\nFirst off this is an assumption. And a really bad one at that. Let's look at the cost of life first. We have civilian casualties which would be 99% assured from the strikes. This would be quite a few number of people per strike. Compare this to the much smaller risk of killing civilians compared with the extremely small chance that one of our soldiers would die the cost to life is clearly on the side of soldiers.\n\nNext let's look at the monetary cost. We can look at just the weapon used alone in the strikes can range from $10000(an extremely low estimate) to $110000(this was the maximum amount that I looked up but there are probably more costly missiles). Now compare this to the total operational cost of sending in soldiers. We have bullets that would be used. Fuel would be used. The soldiers and analysis itself don't actually cost anything because the soldiers are paid regardless and the same goes for the analysis(if not assigned to this they would still be assigned elsewhere). So when it comes to monetary costs strikes are still far more costly.\n\nAs for credibility well this [this](http://rendezvous.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/22/sizing-up-the-effects-of-u-s-drone-attacks/?_r=0) and [this](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lisa-schirch/drones_b_1630592.html) paint a clear picture of how our program is doing. Really shitty and we're only making it worse for ourselves. There's not as much of a credibility issue when it comes to sending soldiers in.\n\nNow mind you, you didn't stand a chance against me in this debate anyways. I actually debate this on my debate team at school. I'm a hell of a lot more informed about it than most people on here."

"Let's untangle this. \n\n1: There is no suggestion that a positive experience should be associated with payment, only that a monetised transaction usually involves utility. One kind of utility is pleasure,and from an analytical perspective, the production costs of that utility are irrelevant to its price unless they define the supply curve, The whole point of IP is that (a) it refers to monetised transactions and (b) that the supply costs do not define the supply curve. IP is a rent barrier - that is what it is for. Otherwise a patented item would be sold at close to commoditised production cost, which is what the patent is there to avoid. \n\n&gt;the exchange value and use value of creative works exist in direct contradiction\n\nI do not understand this distinction of what defunct French and Russian writers have to do with the issue. IP is about \"P\", not \"I\". Within a given time frame, society has deemed that it is appropriate to reward producers for their efforts. It does this for with patents and copyright. It does not matter whether this is in soem abstract academic sense right or wrong, it's what we do and how things are. "

"But it took a shock to our system to set this in motion, a hastily (and almost successfully) implemented anti-sedition law that could have altered the cultural and media landscape. It woke us up to the gravity of the situation, and also our own power to stop it. \n\nI was there on July 1st, 2003 when approximately 1/8th of the Hong Kong population came out to march against [Article 23](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Basic_Law_Article_23), the vaguely-worded anti-sedition law that resembled the laws that China uses to persecute bloggers, journalists and citizens for voicing contrary opinions. I don't think anyone expected such a turnout (least of all Beijing and the local pro-Beijing politicians), and I remember being in a river of neighbours all in awe of how many like-minded, passionate people had turned up to voice their opinion; the same opinion. Before then, Hong Kongers were known for their apathy in local politics. Everything changed that day. \n\nAnd it worked. Article 23 was never implemented and its most vocal proponents in government resigned, including the unpopular Chief Executive soon after. \n\nI truly believe this was the day we discovered our collective voice, and how powerful we can be when we speak as one. It fundamentally changed the nature of our city's politics, and how the citizenry saw itself. \n\nIt's now tradition to march each year on July 1st, to remind them that we still want ownership of our city and government, and that we're not fucking leaving. \n\nCorrection: The July 1st marches have been tradition since the 1997 handover, 2003 was a watershed year for the march but not the first one.

To make this entire discussion irrelevant by outlining how Swiss culture is not defined and divided by languages, is this quote from wikipedia: \n\n&gt;Switzerland comprises four main linguistic and cultural regions: German, French, Italian and the Romansh-speaking valleys. Therefore the Swiss, although predominantly German-speaking, do not form a nation in the sense of a common ethnic or linguistic identity; rather, the strong sense of identity and community is founded on a common historical background, shared values such as federalism and direct democracy and Alpine symbolism.\n\nSo as we can see, ethnicity and language do not necessarily define culture. Let's assume, for a moment, that Switzerland's cultural diversity is equatable to that of the USA. Even then, Swiss success would not necessarily translate to the USA because of the vast difference in politics, economics, and culture between the two countries.

"&gt; its not a stretch to believe that they started to espouse these values, as a reaction to the handover to china, in part by showing how 'different' they are in terms of political opinion, and to maintain their 'special' and 'separate' identity from mainland china.\n\nActually, it is a stretch. Your argument rests upon the presumption that Hong Kong is irrationally acting out. You're correct in presuming that there is an effort to maintain an identity separate from mainland China however those efforts aren't superficial. I'll grant you that the British had their fair share of issues however, unlike today, they didn't threaten basic rights like the ones aforementioned to the same degree as China appears to do so. Further, there was much less of an ideological divide than the one we witness today between Hong Kong and China. Hong Kong isn't fighting for the sake of fighting, it's fighting to maintain aspects of itself which are being threatened. "

"**About your post...**\n\nHeres a source from the PRC. Its the website for the department of protests and petitions. http://english.gov.cn/2005-10/02/content_74182.htm\nHeres the Chinese version:\nhttp://www.gjxfj.gov.cn\n\nThese are the official government faces of their \"Protest Bureau\" -- seems pretty friendly and PR focused, right? Thats because it is. Now, when you research any particular protest from any given day in China, you'll realize that they petition these government bureaus (assuming they aren't protesting things like, say, western governments declaring war in Asia, Japan taking oil from Chinese islands and being protected by the US navy in doing it, corporations abusing people, etc).\n\nThis government bureau doesn't go out mass arresting or killing proptesters. They actually facilitate and allow protests to take place all over the country, just like any normal civilized government does. Sometimes protestors become angry that they aren't having their demands met, and they organize bigger protests and sometimes violent protests -- these violent protests tend to result in attacking the PR offices of the government (which we can view as the \"ear\" of the government for this post) and this results in beijing sending in reinforcements to help diffuse the situation, and its often easier to just meet the protestors demands or meet a compromising settlement to fix their problems than it would be to say, execute them all for no fucking reason which doesn't happen.\n\nFalun Gong did something bad. Falun Gong and some of the \"outlawed\" protests have tried to do things that threatened the lives of people. They weren't protesting in areas that are legal to protest. They were warned, numerous times, and as their warnings progressed it ultimately resulted in the movement being outright outlawed. Other groups have met similar fates in similar ways. Its only logical. In any case, I find the Chinese approaches both reasonable and comparable to how western government approach these things. You need to arm your self with a bit of skepticism when you google \"Chinese human rights abuses\" and you give yourself a crafted bias by only looking for instances of bad things that are probably the exception rather than the rule Its a country with 1.3+ billion people, there are going to be an entire bellcurve of different protests and how they were handled and conducted and what resulted.\n\n* Example of a Chinese city: Shanghai, my home.\n\nhttp://static5.businessinsider.com/image/4c0da1937f8b9acc15d30100/shanghai-china.jpg See this picture? Thats where I live. It is the biggest city in the world and has some of the most expensive real estate on Earth. It also has probably the best public transit imaginable with subway systems and speed trains that can take you anywhere in the country at incredibly high speeds. Life here is a higher standard of living than the United States. Tell me again how terrible my police state is."

"&gt;You're suggesting that our soldiers should risk their lives so that we don't risk accidentally killing a terrorist's family member? We use drones and missilies because there aren't enough good samaritans like you willing to put their life on the line for a violent extremists potentially innocent family member.\n\nYes I am suggesting that they risk their lives because they signed up knowing they would be risking their lives. They knew the risks beforehand. And when it comes to the fact that it is completely unnecessary to use an extremely expensive missile to kill one dude compared to the fact that sending in soldiers to capture the same dude holds basically no risk plus it's not as monetarily expensive and doesn't destroy infrastructure and innocent people. And strikes massively hurt our credibility as well because of the fact we're killing so many innocents and people's homes. We're creating more terrorism because of it.\n\n&gt;Wait.. I just realized I'd made an assumption. You are in the military right? I just can't imagine a civilian saying \"Go die soldier, so the enemy combatants family can live.\" Well.. I suppose you could be a politician..\n\nYou are assuming off the bat that every time soldiers enter combat they die. This simply isn't true. All you're doing is trying to appeal to people's emotions rather than dealing with reality. It's not honest or very sincere. It's certainly not compassionate.\n\n&gt;Losing good people blows. Truth be told though, I'd rather it happen to them than to us. Minimize their losses, of course, but minimize ours first. Everybody can't be a martyr. Until we get more people like you who value the lives of potential innocents over their own, get them strapped with M-16's and shipped to whatever middle eastern country is fucking around at the time, these impersonal and more error prone modes of dealing with the situation will continue.\n\nMy god you're a monster. You said I could be a politician except this is the exact same rhetoric many politicians use. This is the exact mindset that is in our current military. And guess what it hasn't worked out at all for us. For every terrorist we kill five more take their place. We're creating more terrorists because of this kill them all mindset.\n\nhttp://rendezvous.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/22/sizing-up-the-effects-of-u-s-drone-attacks/?_r=0\nhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/lisa-schirch/drones_b_1630592.html\n\nHonestly this really isn't hard to research.\n"

The patent is there foster innovation; the inventor provides the public with the detailed workings of his creation in exchange for a limited monopoly on it's sale. The explicit goal of the system is to foster a public intellectual commons, not an a priori belief that all intellectual work out to be rewarded, that is secondary and only exists in service of the former need.\n\n&gt;IP is about \"P\", not \"I\".\n\nTheir is no justification for that statement, and \"it's what we do and how things are,\" is the most god awful justification that could possibly made. If you actually read the history of copyright and patent laws you will see that the intent has always been largely the fostering of an intellectual commons, and it is only large publishers, groups like the RIAA and MPAA and their predecessors, that have pushed the idea that creative works are naturally property that can be treated the way land or furniture is."

"Like somebody else pointed out, somewhere in Canada tried this as a temporary social experiment of sorts. The results (according to the wikipedia article) were a mixed bag, but seemed to have some favorable outcomes. \n\nThat being said, my point is that simply demonstrating that this works in a small homogenous area is not enough to justify implementing it on a nationwide scale in a country as diverse as the USA. This income that the swiss is implementing is a national standard of 2,500 Swiss Francs. If the USA was to do something similar it could not be a national standard; it is *much* more expensive to live in California than it is to live in a rural, agricultural state in the center of the USA. How would this discrepancy be resolved? Who would decide how much the difference is, and based on what? Each state would have to have their own adjusted minimum income, and even then within states there can be *huge* discrepancies in the cost of living over small geographical areas. Living in the central valley of California is much cheaper than living on the coastline, for example. The minimum income would have to vary even within states! \n\nMy point is, Switzerland is too small of an example of a country to demonstrate that this would work for larger, diverse nations like the USA, and in order for at least me to be satisfied that it would work it would need to be tested in a larger geographic area with a higher and more diverse population.

"OK, you have a bubble app. Great.

This is easier if I'm a government, because I've forced all the big hardware manufacturers to install and provide me with backdoor keys to their products.\n\n- Next, if I have the budget, I physically visit your computer location and add something either to it or near it which can record your keystrokes or screen in various ways.\n\n- Finally, especially if I'm someone like the NSA, I'm probably already recording all the emails which get received by most people, using one of these methods. So it doesn't really matter even if you personally are *completely* hackproof, as I can just compromise your recipient and read your emails at their end.

To engage in war with China, they'd have to get our blessing first. By removing our military bases from the country, Japan would probably increase the size of its military. The more unilateral they are in capability, the more likely they are to use military force as Tokyo deems fit. Alternatively, they may immediately seize the Senkaku islands, resulting in Chinese uproar. This has to do with Clausewitzian principles of smaller states going to war. If Japan feels as if an increasingly aggressive China will eventually impose its territorial claims as its military force outmatches all regional players, then they might conduct a sort of preemptive seizure while their chances of victory are the highest.\n\nEdit: changed up a couple of words"

Indeed after terrorist attacks that size killing thousands of people, there is BILLIONS of dollars. How many billions exactly? \n\nWell, the total property damage from 9/11 is estimated at around $21 billion. Direct wage losses at another $17 billion, and total damage to NYC including reduced economic output around $95 billion. [Source](http://www.iags.org/costof911.html)\n\nBut how much does the illusion of security cost? Well, it has cost us **$2 Trillion** already, and is projected to total around **$6 Trillion**, and over 6,700 combat deaths of US service members **in war alone**. [Source](http://www.globalresearch.ca/us-wars-in-afghanistan-iraq-to-cost-6-trillion/5350789) [Source](http://www.defense.gov/news/casualty.pdf)\n\nSo in fact, we've been pissing away money over the last decade at double the rate of 9/11's impact while occasionally losing soldiers to guerrilla-based fighters with an exterior position... and we call it industry, not murder.\n\nYou know Stalin's quote \"One death is a tragedy, One million is a statistic\"? The fact of the matter is this is exactly what's going on when it comes to \"national security\" these days. We've essentially made ourselves an amazingly expensive apparatus capable of relocating bloodshed to third world countries, at the expense of greatly magnifying it and wasting a huge percentage of our economic output. We can pay a very high price to the tune of weeks a year worth of wages, and reduce the chances of our kids getting decapitated at home by 0.00001%, while relocating and magnifying the violence elsewhere.\n\nNow I don't know about you, but I'd rather take my check for $6300 cut of the $2 Trillion dollars than reduce the odds of something that had a 0.00001% chance of killing me 10 years ago closer to zero. And we're just talking war expenditure. [Source](http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/terrorism/terror-rate.html)\n\nThe time cost of security in modern life as point out is massive. Maybe people *feel* more secure. But you know what, they honestly *shouldn't*. Your odds of dying in a terrorist attack in the US are negligible, and they will continue to be that way regardless of *what* security policy we adopt. At the moment all the security theater is if anything [killing more people in car accidents indirectly](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/09/excess_automobi.html) than anything.\n\nMaybe when terrorism is actually a more common cause of death in the US than suicide, we can start looking at whether some increased security measures are warranted. ***Right now, all we've got is a moral panic.***"

The majority of Chinese people today live in major cities, this is a fact, and this is a well documented trend you'll find anywhere including wikipedia because its a pretty significant fact with many consequences.\n\nChina's standard of living is rising, Americas is going down, Shanghai is better than America's average and virtually any comparison of Shanghai and NewYork that you can find on google will conclude Shanghai is the better place to live by leaps and bounds.\n\nIn short: I get it. You're in taiwan. Taiwan is highly politically charged because of their controversial political position in the world.

"That is ridiculous.\n\nInflation is not some supernatural curse that indiscriminately punishes a society, in proportion to their \"sin\", for violating the divine order of \"the way things must be\".\n\nInflation is subject to cause and effect like other mundane and non-supernatural processes.\n\nInitiating an unconditional, universal, basic income like the one described might trigger a small amount of inflation, which is not a tragedy in itself.  In fact if inflation is too low savers are not rewarded for the use of their money and borrowers face more headwind in paying down their debts (because the value of the principal is stable rather than declining over time).  \n\n\nThe risk of excessive inflation is very low for this proposed initiative.  \n\nThe scope it would introduce for increased demand is lower than the scope for increased production.   Any tax based cost increases needed to fund the initiative would be relatively low and labor cost increases would be limited to the bottom end of the labor market where the rewards for working are so low, people wouldn't take the jobs if they could live without one.  \n\nThe temptation to increase costs to retain annual net profits or rates of returns on capital investments/financial investments would be tempered by the potential risks of losing market share if competitors don't respond with price increases, and of encouraging new entrants to the market if the \"per unit\" profit margin or rate of return on capital investment increases despite the plausibility of achieving good returns with lower per unit prices.\n\nAdditionally, for goods and services with elastic demand, an increase in aggregate consumer incomes, (particularly an indiscriminate and flat increase that results in low income earners getting the highest rate of increase in their incomes), would stimulate and increase demand so for many goods and services increases in costs would be offset to some extent (and in best case scenarios completely covered with some to spare) by increased sale volumes.\n\nVery few goods or services would need to be sold at higher prices to cover resulting cost increases to individual producers, and raising your prices when you don't need to is inviting competitors to under cut your prices and swallow up your market share.  \n\nThe proposed initiative triggering excessive inflation is really not plausible.\n"

The largest dictatorship in the world, and we are economic 'buddies' to them.\n\nAlso, my country supports Saudi Arabia, which is clearly a human rights \"Bizarro World\", and needs little further elaboration here, except to say that in doing so the U.S. also props up the continuing fossil fuel crazy train.\n\nWe knocked the feet out from under the biggest democracy in the Middle East (Iran), and after the dust has settled, we suppress the truth and pretend *they* are the ones who wronged *us*.\n\nSimilarly, the United States constantly touts its \"unconditional support\" of Israel.  This is yet another atrocity that my own country commits.  They take taxes from my pocket, and hand over more to Israel than to any other country on Earth (you know, because Israel is so much needier than, say, the Congo).\n\nIn all of these situations, I am looking at these (seemingly) external atrocities as extensions of my own country's actions.  Actions done with my dollars and my effort - and without my agreement in the matter.  My own country contravening my will, forcing my effort to benefit those who deserve none of my support.\n\ntl;dr:  The continuing unconditional support of Israel is *not* the **worst** atrocity the U.S. has ever committed ... but it is on the list, and it is still ongoing."

According to [this article](http://www.jpost.com/National-News/NGO-accuses-Israel-of-torturing-Palestinian-children-during-winter-storm-336685), the Israeli government also seems to have been shocked and disturbed.\n\n&gt;The practice of placing the children in outdoor cages was halted when Justice Minister Tzipi Livni learned of it and immediately telephoned Public Security Minister Yitzhak Aharonovitch, telling him to end the practice.\n\nIt certainly doesn't sound like deliberate policy.  Particularly given how quickly the Israeli government intervened once it learned what was going on.\n\n&gt;According to the Public Defender’s Office, it learned of the issue during a standard visit to prison complex in Ramle at the height of the storm, with the children enduring freezing temperatures and inclement weather outside a transit facility.\n\n&gt; The children were to be held outside for a number of hours overnight after their arrest until they were to be brought to court in the early morning.\n\n&gt; Livni’s office confirmed that she had personally intervened.\n\n&gt; It was unclear who within the Prisons Service initiated the practice, why it was initiated or who decided to continue it despite the adverse weather conditions, but the service responded that since it had received criticism the situation had been improved.\n\nIt will be interesting to see what the Israeli government does in the aftermath of this."

"I think you bring up good points but I;m not sure I agree with all of it.\n\n1. You're right that it cost billions of dollars. We have to spend a large amount of money to provide for those families who lost a father or mother in the 9/11 attacks, but is that more than how much we're spending on IDs and security measures for millions of Americans now? Losing the towers/having the Pentagon hit cost dollars of course, but in a healthy economy, those are one time dollars. What I mean is that even though the towers were destroyed, the most valuable part of them (the business it conducted) should be able to move on into another medium (after a slow lag in the economy which you bring up in 3). This also applies to people who lost their jobs; their skills should be transferrable into another job. This, however, brings us into point 2\n\n2. It's hard for these transfer things I talked about to happen in a bad economy. But you're saying 9/11 caused the economy to collapse (I assume you mean the recession of 2008-2012). The economy was already slowing before 9/11 though, after the dot-com bubble. Obviously 9/11 didn't help, and when Bush got a slowing economy and then a big terrorist attack, he tried his hardest to keep the economy chugging along. Interest rates were lowered and spending on defense increased, so actually, the economy boomed for ~4 years. Yes, there was a dip in the immediate aftermath of 9/11, but in terms of numbers, our economy was \"helped\" by 9/11. Unfortunately, lowering interest rates only pushed the coming down of our economy due to the dot-com bubble up the road, in the form of the housing bubble collapse. That wasn't very fun, but I'm not sure I would say that was terrorist induced, more so lax Fed Res policies and maybe poor regulation on financial institutions.\n\n3. I agree with this point, but we jumped to the other extreme (in my opinion). Sure, we should have enhanced security, but if we want to \"be real\", how often do our enhanced airline security checks catch anyone? I'm fairly certain it's none, our regular security would have done it anyway (metal detector, xray). People forget pretty easily; I doubt terrorism is what everyone in airports are thinking right now. I'm fairly certain that they're annoyed at having to take off their shoes and go through their new fancy maybe-invasive etc scanner that we spent millions on to fight terrorism. The amount of money that went into going into such extremes have far outweighed number 1. Imagine if instead of invading Iraq (and to a lesser extent, Afghanistan), we focused on working with the international community to set up a good intelligence network to catch bin Laden. In fact, it was intelligence that eventually led us to him. Caveat though, this overspending (in my opinion) did boost our economy in the aftermath of 9/11."

You're on a debate team and you did a hack job like that?!  \n\nYou obviously have next to no idea what you are talking about.  You haven't accounted for any monetary costs other than what? A quick google search to back up your weak argument?  You haven't named any of the missile systems because you're either too lazy to post them or you actually don't know which types of systems are used.  \n\nYou completely omitted the air fuel costs of shuttling troops back and forth across eastern Afghanistan and the Hindu Kush Mountain Range (increased opportunity for friendly casualties).  You completely omitted the cost of maintaining quick reaction forces that would need to be deployed to keep up with the operational tempo of the new ground troop strikes.  (Each operational unit needs a much larger unit to provide security or enhanced combat power in the event of counter attack.)\n\nYes, that's deployed from America, and no, it doesn't cost the same.  You completely omitted the fact that drone strike CIVCAS (look it up) incidents have gone down over 50% in the last 4 years.  I'm talking actual costs of logistics and civilian deaths.  All of which are available to you through open source means if you actually want to look them up.\n\nYou have no idea what the OPTEMPO of drone strikes is per year because you obviously didn't look it up and neglected to overlay that over the already extremely high number of special operations ground strikes a year.  Do you understand that this destroys your monetary comparison completely?  The units operating in theater would need to be bolstered with more special operations troops to maintain the ISAF operational tempo.  That means more units deploying, which rises the cost per person exponentially, not to mention the cost of supporting them in theater.\n\n&gt;extremely small chance that one of our soldiers would die the cost to life is clearly on the side of soldiers.\n\nAre you kidding?  Use your logic.  We are constantly losing special operations soldiers in Afghanistan.  How about we double the travel times and send them into enemy held areas in the Pakistani Frontier Provinces, Federally Administered Areas, and Waziristan... that would mean that the risk of death would remain the same?  Are you serious?  Actually think about it.\n\nThere's a reason the answer is not as simple as stopping drones all together.  IT'S NOT A SIMPLE QUESTION.  \n\nHad you tried to answer the question with more respect for \"debate\" and less desire to sound like a condescending prick I would have wasted my time asking where you debate.  What you should do is copy these posts and take them to your debate team advisers in order to find out what you did wrong and how you can do better the next time.  I'm not perfect, but I know that you need substance in order to name drop your \"debate team at school\" and actually have it mean something. \n\nThe reason I haven't posted any numbers here is because it's all available over google if you actually want to learn.  If not, go on being ignorant. \n\nI'm hoping you have actual interest in what's really going on, and that I haven't wasted my time responding.

Even if we reduce the chance to .000000000000000000000001% chance of ever being killed in a terrorist act, the next time it happens people will again feel unsafe and throw so much away trying to fix it. People will always react that way until its 0% which can easily be acknowledged to not be possible.

I'm not taking Israel's side here.\n\nGood.\n\n&gt; Yes, native to the original land from which most were forcefully removed.\n\nYes.\n\n&gt; Yes, and I have to add that a lot of immigration happened in 1920-1945 legally.\n\n(See above). 'Legal' is irrelevant when the _occupying_ power makes the rules, don't you think? To the extent that their is a problem, is to the extent THAT THE ORIGINAL PEOPLE WERE NEVER CONSULTED TO MAKE LEGAL RULES. \n\n&gt; No. The original UN plan said there should not be any discrimation based on religion. However, if I understood it correctly, future plans and/or Israel changed it so that they could get rid of most Muslims. That is wrong. Those who lived inside current Israel originally, should have been allowed to live there.\n\nYup!\n\n&gt; Are you implying it is somehow ok to murder civilians even if they are \"occupiers\"?\n\nIf you are an occupier, how are you at the same time a civilian. **Occupy is a verb.** It means you are _doing_ something, (_to_ occupy) in this case, actively, _occupying_ something that is not yours. How are you then a civilian. \n\n&gt; I'm not taking Israel's side here, as you can see I'm still learning the Israel/Palestine situation and history here.\nI am however taking the side that it is never ok murder unarmed civilians.\n\nI appreciate that you are learning, and you have a lot to learn. Just because a conflict is controversial doesn't mean both sides have equal weight. Common sense can tell you what is right, along with rigorous questioning. How can you be a civilian if you are an occupier?\n\n\n\n\n"

"&gt; Or did I read it wrong and EVERY Dell, EVERY Cisco switch, EVERY device is pre-installed and reporting data? I call bullshit on that; people (business and private) watch outbound packets, even a new windows release can't call home for any reason without someone noticing.\n\nWatch the presentation, especially the part regarding air-gapped computer networks. This is about Dell and other US tech betraying their partnerships with global business customers by back dooring their hardware. Look at it this way: you are an hospital IT manager based in the EU, tasked with buying rack server equipment for storage and processing of peoples private medical records. Last year you refused to buy inexpensive hardware from Chinese firm Huawei because of [reports in the media](http://world.time.com/2013/04/04/huawei-the-chinese-company-that-scares-washington/) that the company was back-dooring their equipment and sending critical data to foreign intelligence. So you bought Dell servers instead. Now you find that Dell have been doing the exact same thing! You call to complain, but all you get is a first level helpdesk rep tell you dismissively that \"Dell is sorry for the inconvenience\".\n\nThis is about the trustworthiness and reputation of all American technology businesses in the global market.

"&gt; That's fine! If it turns out that it's ultimately not worth the expense to solve global warming then it would in that case be not that big of a problem. \n\nNo, it could also mean the costs of solving climate change are even worse than the extremely severe consequences of climate change. Terraforming an inhabited planet might not be cheap.\n\n&gt; As far as I know, none of the seriously proposed ways to combat the worst effects of global warming are against the laws of physics or is in opposition to the second law or whatever.\n\nIt might be, however, that society does keep its head in the sand too long, making a solution energetically impossible given the advanced progression of the problem: for example, waiting to the point where methane releases from the ocean and exponentially compounds warming. Technology is not a call girl: it comes to mankind either by capricious chance (eg the discovery of penicillin), by obvious incremental profit incentives (eg improvements to fuel efficiency), or when researchers do exhaustive, expensive, time-consuming research on it (eg the manhattan project). So far the world has very little in terms of serious investment in climate change.\n\n&gt; &gt;  Some problems are beyond the reach of scientific understanding\n&gt;\n&gt; Ah, but that attitude does lead to mysticism. \n\nFor the record, you ignored  the following parenthesis and preposition \"(or the will of the society to develop) within the timeframe they occur.\"\n\n&gt; Time and time again we've seen problems that seem on the face of it to be absolutely intractable be eventually cracked open. It's the people who place restrictions on what science can or can't achieve who end up with egg on their face.\n\nI think this is certainly a hasty generalization fallacy. I can think of no examples before the year 19th century -- with the depletion of whale oil and food uncertainty -- where the sustainability of the current human economy required a technological innovation within a strict time limit (in that case, the adoption of coal and fertilizer advancements).\n\nOverall, faith in science should not be used as a license to act foolishly with the environment. Maybe climate change is feasibly solvable and maybe not; your presumption of certainty is perhaps wrong and definitely based on an informal fallacy."

"Then how do you, following this logic, explain the absence of tens of thousands of men and women killed at the hands of Christians and Jews for the crime of consuming shellfish?\n\nActually, hold on, let's forget the shellfish. The fact that there are essentially no circumstances in which one can identify a \"shellfish eater\" at a mere glance lessens the obviousness that virtually no one has actually followed that religious mandate for hundreds of years.\n\nInstead, let's look at Deuteronomy 13:1-17.\n\n---\n\n&gt;“Suppose there are prophets among you or those who dream dreams about the future, and they promise you signs or miracles, and the predicted signs or miracles occur. If they then say, ‘Come, let us worship other gods’—gods you have not known before— do not listen to them. The Lord your God is testing you to see if you truly love him with all your heart and soul. Serve only the Lord your God and fear him alone. Obey his commands, listen to his voice, and cling to him. The false prophets or visionaries who try to lead you astray must be put to death, for they encourage rebellion against the Lord your God, who redeemed you from slavery and brought you out of the land of Egypt. Since they try to lead you astray from the way the Lord your God commanded you to live, you must put them to death. In this way you will purge the evil from among you.\n\n---\n\n&gt;“Suppose someone secretly entices you—even your brother, your son or daughter, your beloved wife, or your closest friend—and says, ‘Let us go worship other gods’—gods that neither you nor your ancestors have known. They might suggest that you worship the gods of peoples who live nearby or who come from the ends of the earth. But do not give in or listen. Have no pity, and do not spare or protect them. You must put them to death! Strike the first blow yourself, and then all the people must join in. Stone the guilty ones to death because they have tried to draw you away from the Lord your God, who rescued you from the land of Egypt, the place of slavery. Then all Israel will hear about it and be afraid, and no one will act so wickedly again. \n\n---\n\n&gt;“When you begin living in the towns the Lord your God is giving you, you may hear that scoundrels among you are leading their fellow citizens astray by saying, ‘Let us go worship other gods’—gods you have not known before. In such cases, you must examine the facts carefully. If you find that the report is true and such a detestable act has been committed among you, you must attack that town and completely destroy all its inhabitants, as well as all the livestock. Then you must pile all the plunder in the middle of the open square and burn it. Burn the entire town as a burnt offering to the Lord your God. That town must remain a ruin forever; it may never be rebuilt. Keep none of the plunder that has been set apart for destruction. Then the Lord will turn from his fierce anger and be merciful to you. He will have compassion on you and make you a large nation, just as he swore to your ancestors.\n\n---\n\nNow tell me, when was the last time you saw this occur, or even heard of its occurrence on these grounds? When was the last time *you* judged a Jew or Christian as a religiously motivated child killer, even though in their daily life they are an all-around pleasant person who does not harm those of different beliefs in any way?  \nPerhaps they simply abstain from obeying the more abhorrent commands given by the holy texts they proclaim them self to be a follower of because their parents were of the same religion, or they just like communal church gatherings, so they continue to identify their self as a Jew or Christian. \nDo you routinely \"judge\" others for that decision, or do you think it is unreasonable to do so?\n\nRemember, you yourself just said that the logic governing your own thought process dictates that: \"Identifying one self as a follower of a religion or ideology is an action\"."

"Yes.  And since then Israel [has worked with UNICEF](http://www.unicef.org/media/media_70666.html) to make changes to its juvenile military detention practices:\n\n&gt; UNICEF on “Children in Israeli military detention”: first progress report\n\n&gt; JERUSALEM, 14 October 2013 - On 6 March 2013, UNICEF released a briefing paper titled “Children in Israeli military detention” which outlined practical measures to improve the treatment of Palestinian children in Israeli military custody. The paper stated that there appeared to be a pattern of ill-treatment during the arrest, transfer and interrogation of child detainees in the West Bank. In response, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Israel stated it would study the conclusions of the report and work to implement its recommendations in cooperation with UNICEF.\n\n&gt; UNICEF has since worked closely with the office of the Israeli Military Advocate General, with the diplomatic community and with international, Israeli and Palestinian organizations in order support the process of translating the recommendations into concrete actions.\n\n&gt; Seven months after the paper was released, reports of violations are ongoing. Israeli authorities are taking steps towards addressing some of UNICEF recommendations, including:\n\n&gt; 1. In September 2013, the IDF Central Command for the West Bank has agreed to pilot test in two areas in the West Bank, a new approach: to issue summons of children in lieu of night arrest at home, which can be traumatic for children and their siblings. This is a critical development, in line with one of the paper’s most important recommendations, which states that “arrests of children should be conducted during daylight, notwithstanding exceptional and grave situations”.\n\n&gt; 2. In April 2013, Israeli Military Order 1711 came into effect, reducing the time a Palestinian child can be detained prior to appearing before a military court judge for the first time. The new order reduces the time from four days to 24 hours for children aged 12-13, and from four to two days for children aged 14-15. There is no change for children aged 16-17. This measure is in line with the report’s recommendation that children “in detention shall, within 24 hours of their arrest, have prompt and effective access to an independent judicial review of the legality of their arrest and detention”. However these time periods can be extended if “special circumstances” are alleged.\n\n&gt; 3. In The Military Prosecutor stated that since June 2013, the remand hearings for children were held separately from the adults, as the result of a verbal agreement between the prosecution and the judges.\n\n&gt; UNICEF will continue to engage with Israel’s Military Advocate General and advocate for the implementation of all 38 recommendations of the briefing paper, to improve protection for children in conformity with international standards. These recommendations include the prohibition of practices such as blindfolding, painful restraint, physical abuse, strip searching and solitary confinement of children. They stress that except in extreme circumstances, children should not be arrested at night, a lawyer or family member should be present during interrogation of child suspects and a video-recording should be made."

"&gt;Israel aid is different than most other aid given around the world. Israel receives only military aid.\n\nwhich in the end ends up being the same since it allows it to free up its resources to improve other sectors.  the result is pretty much the same.\n\n&gt;That makes it mutually beneficial to US businesses\n\nnot really.  First, like you mentioned, 26% of taxpayer money given to Israel is kept by Israel.  It's a first world country, in the very least all of that money should be used on US products.  And honestly, I believe that money should be used on building roads, providing healthcare, and improving education within the US, not given to military contractors or economical strong nations.  That's how I prefer my taxes to be spent.  Israel has public healthcare and public education, it can easily afford to pay for its own weapons.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28PPP%29_per_capita\n\nIsrael doesn't need monetary assistance any more than France or New Zealand.  Aid should be limited to countries in dyer need of it, nations on the brink of collapse, not economically strong nations.\n\nFurthermore, Israel has sold US military technology to other countries (which then somehow made its way to US adversaries like China).  I do not consider that beneficial to US interests whether this happens in Israel or any other nation.\n\n&gt;Israel has been attacked offensively by its surrounding nations in the past\n\nand now it has nuclear weapons and the full support of the US military (and a good chuck of Europe).  Im all for using our military to aid Israel if it is offensively attacked but it doesn't need our taxes.  It has a strong economy, it has a strong military, it has nuclear weapons, it can deal."

"&gt; If you give everyone money, wouldn't it just raise cost of living even higher? \n\nProbably.  But that's not a particularly relevant question.  A more relevant question is \"would it raise the cost of living at a rate equal to or higher than the boost to nominal consumer incomes?\".  The answer to that is \"very probably not\".\n\n&gt; And if it didn't, there are a LOT of people who would lose all interest in having a job or getting an education. \n\nThere are currently a LOT of people who can't get a job despite their interest in holding one.  \n\nI don't think this would be nearly as much of a problem as you might suppose, for multiple reasons. \n\nWe can afford to lose a LOT of people from the labor pool without experiencing a shortage of labor.  People losing interest in working and acquiring expensive formal educational achievements to boost their chance of getting a job that rewards them reasonably isn't a problem unless it actually results in a labor shortage.  People who actually really don't want to work, opting out of the labor pool and opening up opportunities for those that do, is not innately problematic.  So \"people losing interest in working\" is not a big deal; we only need to worry if enough people lose interest in working to generate a labor shortage.\n\nPeople opting out of the labor pool would actually produce some reduction in the demand for labor; for example, if 25% of mothers who return to work a year after their child is born decided to take 5 years off because they can rely on the basic income, there would be a significant reduction in the demand for child care services for children under 5 years of age, and hence a significant reduction in the demand for labor associated with producing this service.\n\nI contend that enough people would choose to continue working to avoid a significant labor shortage problem.  The basic income would allow someone to not work without becoming homeless and hungry, but it wouldn't support the middle class lifestyle that many workers are accustomed to and motivated by and unwilling to settle for less than.  It wouldn't give a person a sense of purpose, or fill their days, or make them part of a team working on common goals.  It wouldn't offer them personal fulfillment or opportunities to be socially engaged and it wouldn't be materially rewarding when compared to the rewards of working.\n\nThe notion of \"money for nothing\" might seem superficially obviouslymore  attractive when compared to money for working but it's not \"money for nothing or as much money for working\" but \"money for nothing or much more money for working and anyway, not working is not necessarily as attractive as you might be tempted to suppose. \n\n Family households comprised of 2.something children, one worker and a financially dependent spouse were the norm in modern consumer societies within recent history.  A primary driver of the transition to two income households being the norm was the dissatisfaction of many women who had their material needs met but who felt marginalized through banishment to the domestic sphere and resented being denied full participation in the work force.

"While I quite agree with the rest of your post, I think this part is very dubious:\n\n&gt; \\[Leaving the euro\\] would have left Greece with a devaluated local currency and *a debt still in €*.\n\nGreek debt is a sovereign debt, which means it is labeled in whatever currency Greek law decides that it is.  If Greece passes a law that converts all assets held by Greek banks to \"new drachmai\", it could (and would) also convert its own sovereign debt to that new currency (initially at parity with the euro, but obviously would devaluate quickly).  Credit rating agencies would probably call this a default (though I see no reason why this should be different from the case where a country has pegged its currency to another and suddenly unpegs; and anyway Greece is already considered to be in default), but I don't think any legal challenge could be successful.  (At least considering a situation where Greece leaves the EU altogether; since there are no provisions in the EU treaties for a country to leave the Eurozone without leaving the EU, such an exit would have to be negociated — in secret? — on an ad hoc basis, and declaring the debt to be in Greece's new currency would obviously be part of the negotiations.)"

"&gt;You completely omitted the air fuel costs of shuttling troops back and forth across eastern Afghanistan and the Hindu Kush Mountain Range (increased opportunity for friendly casualties).\n\nClearly you didn't read at all. I did in fact account for fuel costs. And your idea that we're sending our troops over extremely long distances for one person is a bit outrageous. I like how you tried to say that I omitted fuel costs when I specifically mention them but also forgot that I never put those same costs for strikes. I didn't need to because the costs of the missiles were enough. And you want me to also look up the cost of missiles(mind you since the burden of proof is on you it is your job to provide that information but you're clearly not a competent debater). But here are two types of missiles used the [maverick](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AGM-65_Maverick) and [hellfire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AGM-114_Hellfire) both of which have been used in these sorts of situations. And you're also ignoring the cost of destroying infrastructure as well.\n\n&gt;You completely omitted the cost of maintaining quick reaction forces that would need to be deployed to keep up with the operational tempo of the new ground troop strikes.\n\nI like how you omitted the fact that those costs are still the same regardless because they're payed regardless of being sent in or not. Dishonest much.\n\n&gt;Yes, that's deployed from America, and no, it doesn't cost the same. You completely omitted the fact that drone strike CIVCAS (look it up) incidents have gone down over 50% in the last 4 years. I'm talking actual costs of logistics and civilian deaths. All of which are available to you through open source means if you actually want to look them up.\n\nIt's irrelevant though because we're talking about the cost per each strike and not the total used. Also the fact that we're talking about going after one single person that is in a civilian population. We're not talking about an armada of terrorists here.\n\n&gt;Are you kidding? Use your logic. We are constantly losing special operations soldiers in Afghanistan. How about we double the travel times and send them into enemy held areas in the Pakistani Frontier Provinces, Federally Administered Areas, and Waziristan... that would mean that the risk of death would remain the same? Are you serious? Actually think about it.\n\nI am using my logic. I haven't forgotten what exactly we're talking about. Going after one dude in a civilian population. You're the one distracting and forgetting what we're actually talking about. None of what you're saying is even relevant.\n\n&gt;There's a reason the answer is not as simple as stopping drones all together. IT'S NOT A SIMPLE QUESTION.\n\nGood thing I never said that we should stop using drones entirely. Just that we shouldn't use drone strikes to take out ONE person in a civilian population.\n\n&gt;Had you tried to answer the question with more respect for \"debate\" and less desire to sound like a condescending prick I would have wasted my time asking where you debate. What you should do is copy these posts and take them to your debate team advisers in order to find out what you did wrong and how you can do better the next time. I'm not perfect, but I know that you need substance in order to name drop your \"debate team at school\" and actually have it mean something.\n\nWhat it's called is topicality. I kept  on topic while you moved away from it. By any means I would have won this debate by a long shot.\n\n&gt;The reason I haven't posted any numbers here is because it's all available over google if you actually want to learn. \n\nOh so I have to do all the research while you on the other hand(despite you having the burden of proof) don't have to do jack shit.

"&gt; Our occupation of all these places is really what's creating more terrorists.\n\nOh I never said there weren't other cause only that strikes were a pretty big cause of recruitment."
"So what country is being occupied again?"
"Absolutely not. If you're incapable of understanding the point past your closed view, that is not my issue. But I will make a second attempt.\n\nLet's cycle backwards a bit, the Middle Ages(Or Medieval Era). In this time, concepts such as nationhood were alien in concept. You had your liege lord, he had his, and you lived in a Feudal system where that could change at any time. You were never part of a fixed border or a fixed concept that is a nation-state. Yeah, sure, you had Kingdoms, but these were geographical manifestations of a lord's sphere of influence - they could change at any time under certain circumstances. To the average person on the ground, there was you, and your immediate superior.\n\nAt this time, religion was thriving. It was really gearing up in power. When people had no fixed political affiliation, what could they *really* identify themselves with? What common ground could any one man have with another? Religion. Religion transcended politics. If the Pope was displeased with a ruler, or excommunicated them, the vassals of said ruler would rise up and depose them because in their eyes, it was *religion* that was the ultimate authority. This is why during the Crusader Era, there was relatively unprecedented levels of peace in Europe, because all those who were fighting for land in Europe were off fighting Holy Wars in the Middle East instead.\n\nYou get the point. Religion was the overriding authority. People listened to their holy man or clergy. This was true even up until the early 20^th century for many parts of Europe - particularly places like Ireland, Italy, and Germany. \n\nThis is where I believe Islam is. Not on such an extreme level, but it is still struggling to leave that stage. The concepts and ideas of nationhood, nationalism, belief in your country are starting to take hold in the Islamic world, but they are not concrete. The Middle East is still suffering from the political style that Europe was knee deep in 100 years ago. There is no *security*. When people don't have this, they *will* turn to religion as a constant. When you are born a Muslim in the Middle East, that is *you*. That is what you are. That is your identifier. Of course you're Egyptian, or Iraqi, or Lebanese, but you're a *Muslim*. That's why the Sunnis and Shiites are all killing the shit out of eachother even though they're from the same countries - to those on each side, if you're not of the same denomination, you're as foreign to them as an Afghan to an American.\n\nIf you really want to understand why extremism has been on the rise in Islam, you need to go back to World War I and the Ottoman Caliphate. The Ottoman Empire was also the last caliphate of Islam. It was where all Muslims looked to for religious influence, similar to a Catholic to Rome. The Ottomans were a *somewhat* more tolerant, religiously - other than that whole kidnapping Christian children so they could press them into the government or military thing - so that when the Muslim world looked to the Ottomans, they saw how they should behave, and their behavior was kept in check by a centralized area of scholarship and study of Islam, the Ottoman Caliphate. If there were Muslims getting out of line, the Caliphate would deal with them. When the Ottoman Empire fell shortly after World War I's conclusion, Turkish revolutionary Ataturk dissolved the Caliphate, and there you go. What would Catholics do tomorrow if Rome were to disappear? With no more centralization, nobody to keep extremists in check, no ideal model of Islam for others to look to, the Islamic world fragmented. In the same fashion of Mussolini, or Hitler, or even Churchill, strong leaders managed to draw people to their cause, and their cause was fundamentalist Islam. With no more Caliphate to tell them otherwise, nobody to look to, nobody to keep them in check, many Muslims lost for guidance, went to the Fundamentalists, and they grew in power. \n\nThe extremism and violence you see today is a knock on effect from that. \n\nYou can talk about the justification behind it all, if it's morally correct, barbaric, uncivilized, or if we should tolerate it or whatever. I'm not in on that conversation right now. I'm in on the conversation of trying to explain *why* things are like this, and you're just talking shit as if I'm saying Osama Bin Laden was the best thing since sliced bread. I didn't paint an imaginary circumstance, I didn't oversimplify it, I didn't fawn over anything. I explained in easy, straightforward terms with hypothetical examples. If you're too simple or closed minded to see that, it isn't my issue at any point in time. I'm writing this up as a courtesy to those who may be confused about what I mean."

You can't harvest tiger bones, for example, without killing the animal, of which there are very, very few left in the wild. \n\nYes it can be done.  In fact, it was done in much of Africa before the Ivory ban and there are plenty of wealthy ranchers all over africa.\n\nAs to other animal poaching?  I don't know, I wasn't discussing that.

Because not only do they go against nearly every aspect of Communism but they call themselves Communist while doing it.  The only thing they're half following is the planned economy aspect and even that's gone in a lot of places since the Free Economic Zones were created.\n\nThe other main aspects of Communism are worker controlled means of production (this is basically needed for a state to call itself Communist which is why you see a lot of people arguing that places like the USSR weren't Communist for large amounts of time), some level of economic equality, social equality, good workers rights, a non-market based economy, and anti-nationalism.

This isn't about self-preservation and it never has been. This is about unnecessary risks and costs.\n\n&gt;The difference between you and I is simply that I've chosen to be honest about it, while you're caught in self-deception based on your idealism, combined with the fact that you've never been in a situation where you were forced to confront it.\n\nOh really? So you've met me. You know my life's story. Hmmm I wonder do you know what my career is? Do you know why I chose that career?

Even for a stranger. And don't sit there and pretend that it's an easy choice. Sending someone into combat regardless of how risky is never an easy choice. But our military shouldn't go around massacring people with strikes to get one person. It sets a very bad precedent.\n\n&gt;We don't actually have a kill them all mindset in the military.\n\nStrange because I remember you saying that you didn't give two shits about the terrorists family because the terrorist shouldn't have had them with him if they didn't want to die. That's a kill them all mindset. Killing terrorists no matter the costs.\n\n&gt;Been to Iraq twice. Nobody I worked with wanted to kill people.\n\nIrrelevant because that has nothing to do with a kill them all mindset. Very few people want to go around just killing people. A kill them all mindset is where you say \"hey we need to kill all the terrorists. The costs don't matter. We kill them until they're dead. Civilian casualties and damage to infrastructure are irrelevant. Killing the terrorists is the only thing that matters\" It's the exact mindset that you have. You're not taking into account why people are terrorists. You're thinking that everyone that isn't of your nation is less than human. I ask you then why strikes aren't used within many first world nations that have terrorists hiding in their civilian populations where the outcome would still be the same? Ignore the political ramifications because they're just rhetoric and not based on logical premises.\n\n&gt;So you can suggest we go out there and risk our lives for these people, instead of using the tools technology provides so that we don't have to, \n\nWell when going after one dude it's really poor judgement to send a missile at them. Soldiers would be just fine. I doubt one dude would be able to get even one shot in before being taken out. Hell it would also still be an option to capture him. We have plenty of equipment that would allow us to do so. Now if it's an encampment of terrorists a strike would be a better option but we were never talking about that in the first place.\n\n&gt;but until you're leading by example, it means nothing\n\nAnd how exactly do you know I'm not?

"Your numbers are wrong because they weren't planning on increasing the price only once, but every year on the span of 5 years resulting in an increase of 1600$.\n\nAlso, yes, we pay much less tuition fees in Quebec. This is a decision we made as a society, to have almost free education. This is why we were protesting. Not because we weren't able to pay the increased cost, but because we believe that we shouldn't put a price on education. In fact, one of the reason why we were against the increase in fees is because the increase was so small that it would have changed nothing economically.\n\nEvery past generations benefited from a much better education to a much lower price. The reason why they decided to increase the price now is that the students constitute such a small fraction of the population that the government decided in order to win the next election it had to alienates students in order to rally all the baby boomers."

"They've hidden behind the \"black sheep\" figure of speech several times but it's obvious that these posters are racist. If they weren't they would've avoided using it because it's... obviously racist? Posters like [this one](http://www.digitalcrusades.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/11.jpeg) further serve to clarify that (for those of you who don't speak German, it writes \"No to voting rights for foreigners\" - of course in most countries, people without citizenship do not vote, but.. seriously... this poster) They also campaign against anti-racism laws, supposedly in favor of free speech. \n\nCampaigning on isolationism and racism (sorry but every Swiss person I've ever met also believes they're racist) does place you far on the right. \n\nI also disagree on the \"bad\" flavors of immigration. Crime is only an issue when people are not given the opportunity to integrate. And crime rates in Switzerland are absurdly low. Sure, there are a few bad spots here and there in poorer areas, but considering the number of immigrants, Switzerland is actually a case study of how poor the \"immigrants bring crime\" argument is.\n\nHowever, I fully agree with you that the Swiss political system is amazing, and I wish more countries adopted it. There is a host of things I greatly appreciate about Switzerland, and some things I will probably never understand, but compared to many places Switzerland has a lot going for it. "

I didn't see it, how could I have seen it. I believe him when he says it happened though.\nI also know that he was in prison for about two years never to have any charges attributed to him.

"Those points aren't the slightest bit accurate. \n\nThe only objectively \"good things\" come down to the fact that our economy didn't collapse in 2008, because our banks had stronger regulation which prevented them from being as exposed to the investment failures in the recession, regulations that Harper was adamantly opposed to. He gets absolutely no credit for that, and every one of those points should be taken as a reason to consider him wrong on the economy. \n\nThe others are dubious at best (ie, boutique tax credits targeted for political support that are wasteful and ineffecient, like the children's sports tax credit) or outright wrong (foreign ownership rules being enforced arbitrarily and randomly, depending on the political winds) and expose the government as being tactically astute at courting demographics for votes, but strategically incompetent at anything other than nursing resentment against things like the environment, unions and the public sector. \n\n&gt; Canada still has environmental laws, the Harper government just removed laws that dealt with transportation on lakes and canals. Sometimes, a country can have overbearing environmental laws.\n\nBetween the closure of things like the world-renowned Experimental lakes area, cuts from Environment Canada, and the navigable waters protection act - the government has eliminated any federal protection whatsoever on any but a handful of lakes and rivers. Harper's record on the environment is a disaster, and the zone of pollution around Fort Mac will be a testament to that for generations to come. \n\n&gt;A significant portion of changes to Canada's security apparatus were done under Martin (Liberal) after 911. And calling it a police/surveillance state is misleading.\n\nThat's no defense whatsoever for Harper's enormous expansion of Canada's spying capabilities - despite the cuts to every other government department the expansion in the CSA, CSIS and other domestic surveillance groups has been enormous. These organizations have increased in staff by more than 50% in a decade and their budgets have more than doubled. \n\n&gt;Healthcare is under the jurisdiction of the Federal government. As far as I am concerned, the Provinces should have an monopoly over healthcare - the Federal government should have no business in it. Oh, you also linked a very bias source (union website).\n\nSpeaking of bias... the Canada Health Act has been a federal policy since the beginning of national medicare in canada, the federal government has always played a major role in regulation, funding and management. It doesn't really matter how you feel one way or another - healthcare is in large part a federal responsibility and the government has severely neglected that file. You can't just stop doing something because you don't want to when it's your responsibility. \n\n&gt; I'm sorry, but many Canadians, myself included, do not think Scandinavian is the direction that Canada should be headed.\n\nSo, if the opinion of a majority of Canadians is the key measurement of the direction the country should be heading in, you'd have to agree that this poll which shows a majority disapproving of Harper means he's wrong and we should reverse course?

Take for example the EPA or the FDA. Neither was established to regulate in favor of any one industry, but they have been stacked with lobbyists for industries and they now write the laws that protect and legalize their industries. It happens in the defense industry(I worked for it after I got out of the Navy and saw it first hand), it happens in the agricultural industry, it happens in the banking and financial industries, it happens everywhere in the USA that you can think of. That's why I called it corporatism, because fascism gets linked to pre-WW2 european economies and people associate the word with what they want to as opposed to what it actually means."

"I have been trying to help a friend of mine deal with sexual assault and after reading through alot of this thread, this quote seemed applicable.\n\n\n\"the perpetrator does everything in his power to promote forgetting. Secrecy and silence are the perpetrator's first line of defence. If secrecy fails, the perpetrator attacks the credibility of of his victim. If he cannot silence her absolutely, he tries to make sure that no one listens. To this end he marshals an impressive array of arguments, from the most blatant denial to the most sophisticated and elegant rationalization. After every atrocity one can expect to hear the same predictable apologies: it never happened; the victim lies; the victim exaggerates; the victim brought it upon herself; and in any case it is time to forget and move on. The more powerful the perpetrator, the greater is his prerogative to name and define reality, and the more completely his arguments prevail.\" \n\n-Trauma and Recovery by Judith Herman, M.D.\n\n\nkinda loaded language for this discussion, but I find it really fascinating how people argue about this conflict and how it mirrors trauma cycles.

"&gt;Little girls going through 6 checkpoints\n\nThe checkpoints aren't there for shits and giggles- most of them went up as a direct reaction to the violence of the Second Intifada. They are frustrating and inconvenient, but they also serve to help Israel fulfill its most basic responsibility as a state: providing for the safety of its own civilians. So if Israel sees a very large number of West Bank Palestinians, of all ages and sexes, being recruited to strap themselves with explosive vests and shrapnel, after which they quietly enter crowded Israeli civilian centers and proceed to blow themselves and every Israeli around them to bits, it can't really decide to ignore its responsibility to civilian safety and simply continue letting the roadside piles of dead bodies accumulate, unabated.\n\nThe checkpoints, barriers and blockades Reddit loves to think exist for the purpose of \"Palestinian oppression\" have an actual use- and however worthless Palestinian terrorists might deem Israeli lives to be, the world shouldn't expect the Israeli government to allow them free reign to conduct their attacks against Israeli civilians. If this means the erection of checkpoints, which both terrorists and school children must go though, then any inconvenience they may cause falls on the heads of Palestinian terrorists and their supporters, not the Israeli government.\n\n&gt;all on the way to substandard and segregated schools for Palestinians.\n\nIsrael is not in charge of the Palestinian school system.

Once I saw kids passing, and one of the guys, a reservist who spoke Arabic, wanted to ask them what they study. He didn't mean it in any bad way. Then I saw how the kid nearly peed his pants as the guy tried to kid with him, how the two worlds are simply disconnected. The guy was kidding and the kid was scared to death.\"\n\n&gt;Soldiers who served in the Israeli Army between 2005 and 2011 have discussed their treatment of Palestinians in a 72 page report released by an organisation called Breaking the Silence on Sunday.\n\n&gt;The report features 47 testimonies highlighting the harassment, arrest, and mistreatment of Palestinian children living under Israeli occupation.\n\n&gt;Some of the testimonies describe how children are terrified of the soldiers; crying and even soiling themselves during arrests.\n\n&gt;One testimony describes how children who threw Molotov cocktails in the direction of a settlement were shot even though the Molotov cocktails would not have reached or directly endangered anyone. Once the children lit the Molotov cocktails, they “were free game,” according to a soldier’s testimony."

"1. Yes, like defunding the ELA, which caused [international outcry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_Lakes_Area#Controversy_about_defunding)\n\n2. I don't think it's misleading at all. Taking into consideration they prefer to [build prisons](http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/more-prisons-to-be-expanded-1.1030393) rather than funding social programming to actually get at the *root* of crime, rather than saying idiotic things like \"terrorism is because of terrorists\", surveillance state is not misleading at all. Look up anything by Loic Wacquant, especially his book [Punishing the Poor](http://www.dukeupress.edu/Catalog/ViewProduct.php?productid=14857). It's a U.S. analysis, but very well describes where Canada is heading.\n\n3. I will agree with you on the peacekeeping. Conflict has fundamentally changed and we need to rely more on peaceful negotiations, which often today need to be enforced.\n\n4. A provincial monopoly is undesirable for several reasons. The Canada Health Act states very clearly the [criteria for health service quality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_Health_Act#Public_administration) includes comprehensiveness and portability. Leaving things up to provinces exclusively can lead to [variations of inequity](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2645154/) in these areas. There needs to be some measure of centralization so that we can ensure these criteria are met across the country. Otherwise you're subscribing to a failed doctrine of Reaganism. \n\n5. Here's the thing with this--there are two poles of welfare state models. The U.S. pretty much enshrines the \"Liberal\" welfare model--stingy, meagre, individualizing, and stigmatizing. The Nordic model is closer to the \"social democratic\" welfare state--universal benefits, more inclusive, and includes the idea of \"citizenship\" as being entitled to certain services like Active Labour Market Policies that pro-actively maintain employment. If many Canadians think Canada is heading in the wrong direction, then I feel it is reasonable to argue that we need to move away from a U.S. model. Does this necessarily mean Scandinavian? Perhaps not. But Canada has always been considered by scholars to be a \"social liberal\" welfare state, which has now lost its \"social\". [Olsen](http://www.amazon.ca/Politics-Welfare-State-Canada-Sweden/dp/0195416007/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1388603772&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=Politics+of+the+welfare+state) discusses this idea at length.\n\nI hope your 2014 is fantastic.

"Encrypt it? Never decrypt it in the first place? It depends what kind of data you're talking about and where its going/where its been, but i fail to see how that makes the system any less feasible. For example, if im sending a message on gmail, google shouldnt even have the ability to decrypt it. Only the recipients email client should be able to decrypt it. And if its ever stored on googles servers, it wouldnt be decrypted at all. If it needs to be decrypted and stored on googles servers, it should be behind full disk encryption, and if it ever needs to leave again it should be encrypted once again with the recipients public key after google decrypts it from the full disk encryption. \n\nTakes a small tweak in how things work right now buts its worth it.\n\nTOR already does it, and does more. If every computer was a TOR node, most of these problems would already be solved. TOR + full disk encryption on any data storage would make it pretty difficult for the NSA to do what it does now. Not impossible, with all the hardware implants they apparently have, but much harder. "

"Well it's not as if the Saudis haven't funded Islamists before. Though it's sort of interesting that they blame Pakistan for funding the Taliban and Qatar and Turkey for funding the Muslim Brotherhood. \n\nAs far as the Chechen Islamists go the Saudis are definitely on very dodgy ground if they're claiming to back people who've bombed both Russia and the US. Though admittedly the people who bombed Boston didn't seem like they were under control of anyone back in Chechnya let alone Saudi Arabia. \n\nHowever in the spirit of cooperation I think the US should try and do some sort of deal with Russia to suppress Chechen Islamists. Interestingly they did with the Taliban, and with great success\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cofer_Black#Post_9.2F11:_Global_War_on_Terror\n\n&gt; Armitage and Black flew to Moscow to seek help from top Russian diplomatic and intelligence officials.\n&gt;\n&gt; \"We're in a war,\" Black told the Russians. \"We're coming. Regardless of what you do, we're coming anyway.\" He knew Afghanistan was in their sphere of influence and they would be queasy. \"At the very least we want you to look away.\" He did not want the Russians trying to gum up CIA operations. \"From my humble position, I think this is a historical opportunity. Let's get out of the last century into the next one.\"\n&gt;\n&gt; The Russians indicated they would help and certainly not obstruct. One noted that Afghanistan was ambush heaven, where the guerrilla fighters had demolished the Russian army. \"With regret,\" the Russian said, \"I have to say that you're really going to get the hell kicked out of you\".\n&gt;\n&gt; \"We're going to kill them,\" Black said. \"We're going to put their heads on sticks. We're going to rock their world.\"\n&gt;\n&gt; The Russians soon sent a team to the CIA to provide extensive on-the-ground intelligence, especially about the topography and caves of Afghanistan.\n\nIMO the US should send Armitrage and Black back to Moscow, to really \"get out of the last century into the next one\". Of course Russia is never going to be a real US ally in Eastern Europe. However the Chechens and the Syrian Islamist groups are clearly common enemies. I.e. the US may not like Assad but it is likely to like an Islamist Syria even less. "

"\"Freedoms\" should be balanced, in my opinion. They're balanced when one is free to speak and another is free not to hear him. They're unbalanced when one is free to speak and another is not free to ignore him.\n\nThe same with protests: people should be free to protest, but they should also be free to go to work in the morning and to preserve their private property and physical integrity.\n\nUsually, freedoms for some are associated with concessions from others. An equilibrium between the two is part of what makes a free democratic States."

"There is some implicit assumption in your modeling that is effecting the conclusion you reach.\n\nPeople would be less willing to do jobs that are not sufficiently rewarding to motivate them if they don't have to work to achieve a basic lifestyle.\n\nPossible responses include some businesses paying more for some labor and adsorbing the cost, some businesses paying more for some labor and passing some or all of the cost onto consumers, increased automation of tasks that are not economically viable to pay someone a sufficiently motivating reward given the nature of the task and the willingness of the market to fund increased labor costs through increased prices, and potentially some goods or services would cease to be economically viable (as has happened with many goods and services over time).\n\nBusinesses would be motivated to pursue responses that avoid or minimize prices increases, because of the risk of pricing the good or service out of the market altogether, or simply losing market share to competitors who better constrain their prices.\n\nAiding businesses in avoiding price increases would be increased demand on goods and services where demand is elastic; aggregate consumer income would increase with disproportionate gains relative to income concentrated on the lowest income earners (this group immediately spends nearly all of any aggregate increase in their incomes) because the floor on the minimum income would be higher and because the rewards would have to increase for the jobs that reward workers less than their time, effort, inconvenience and any unpleasantness experienced while working is worth to the employee.\n\nBecause of the increased demand stimulating increased economic activity, the government would actually experience increased tax revenues.\n\nThe upshot is that a few goods and services might not be valued enough by the market to be viable in a context of fair compensation for labor inputs, a few goods and services would cost a little more, adsorbing an insignificant proportion of the increased income for some individuals, but also resulting in a net gain and a real increase in spending power for the consumer aggregate, with subsequent economic growth generating increased taxable revenues.

While this *is* a political issue and one that we absolutely must seek political solutions to, we as the tech community must also recognize the threat presented by pervasive surveillance and start developing technical measures to protect users, just as we try to write software that protects against other attacks. Strong encryption and assured, verifiable programming right down to the hardware firmware level are, now, necessities. \n\nBy taking such steps, we're not just protecting ourselves against the NSA: what they can exploit, other well-funded and even not-so-well-funded actors will eventually also learn how to attack, if they haven't already. If you care about youths in Syria, Egypt, or Russia being safe from government persecution, then you also have to care about the security and privacy of communication tools to which they have access.\n\nEspecially when we know that the IETF and other standards bodies have been targeted for co-option by the NSA, even sometimes being [chaired or co-chaired by NSA employees who seem to be deliberately introducing weaknesses into the protocols they approve](http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/12/critics-nsa-agent-co-chairing-key-crypto-standards-body-should-be-removed/), it's up to us as the hacker/enthusiast community to \"route around\" the damage and build our own strong programs and protocols (and perhaps even standards bodies)."

"\"In the new year, may your right hand always be stretched out in friendship, but never in want\". \n\n&gt;I'm not sure how the American penal system compares to the UK\n\nThese numbers might shock you, but I think it'll help your perspective. As of 2011, the UK prison population stood at around 97 thousand... While the US prison population stood at (I kid you not) about 2.5 million. \nFrom what I've read it doesn't seem like our prison systems are all that much different from one another, although the sheer volume probably creates problems for our system that your system doesn't face. I cannot imagine the logistical nightmare that running the US system must be. \n\n&gt;my frightfully undereducated shortcomings come into play here\n\nWhen it comes to the penal system, the most important thing you need to know is how to avoid becoming a guest in one of it's fine facilities. As long as you know that you'll be fine. \n\n&gt;a prisoner is often moved from one facility to another throughout their sentence\n\nI would assume that this doesn't include category A prisoners who are also labeled as high or exceptional risk for escape. I understand that those prisoners with a prior history of escape are made to change cells frequently, albeit within the prison they are already incarcerated in. I know that in the US, prisoners like that are usually sent to a maximum security prison where they're locked down 23 hours a day with no contact with other inmates and very little contact with the guards (no wonder they want to escape). Well I guess I'm rambling on again so I'll end it here and wish you a happy new year."

"&gt; What else would he be suggesting? [...]\n\n&gt; Read it again, and ask yourself what questions he is actually answering with his post.\n\nLike I said (and like /u/Cyridius himself confirms in his subsequent posts to you), the essence of what he was suggesting was:\n\n(1) people get pissed off if you mock something that they view as part of their identity;\n\n(2) more Muslims see Islam as being a key part of their identity than Christians [more on this below]. This is really a comment on the role of the respective religions in their societies than a comparison of the two religions themselves. Further, I don't think he is referring to the violence of earlier Christianity at all - rather, to the greater importance it played to peoples' identities, ie as per his first premise.\n\n(3) conjecture as to why this is - which he elaborates on below. [I talk about your points on this below]\n\n(4) his conclusion from these premises: mocking Christianity and mocking Islam are not, in all senses, completely equivalent - since the latter is likely to piss more people off.\n\nSo: it's not a 'very hollow \"some Muslims get angrier than Christians\"' - he does say this, but the crux of his post is as to why this might be.\n\nYou might agree with his explanation or not, but what is clear is that he says *absolutely nothing* on whether it's normatively right or wrong that Muslims do so. If you asked me why it's raining, I can say 'because of cloud formation ... precipitation/etc' without declaring it to be a good or bad thing. **Same here: he's giving an explanation why a thing happens, without judging the thing to be normatively good or bad.** Indeed, to have given any judgement one way or the other would would be completely at odds with the rest of the post, and all his subsequent posts (and he denies it's been changed in anything like the way you say it has). \n\nFor what it's worth, if he *did* say something about this in his original post, to the effect that 'so we shouldn't mock Islam' or 'those (few) Muslims are thus morally justified in doing whatever', then I'd definitely be with you in rejecting that suggestion. As things stand, though, you're simply misrepresenting what's been said ... eg\n\n&gt; his suggestion that Islam being younger, is justified to more 'teething' time\n\nHe simply doesn't say this! As above, nowhere does he say anything like 'so we should accept (the few) Muslims kicking off as legitimate'. He simply says *why* (the few) Muslims do kick off.\n\nSimilarly, the only thing you quote from his post doesn't bear out what you're saying it implies. There's simply no normative comment bound up in that whatsoever.\n\n&gt; his depiction of the Muslim mindset, ironically enough is a naive caricature.\n\nHere, I completely agree he could+should have been clearer that (a) it was not being suggested for all Muslims and (b) that there are, eg, certainly, Westernised Christians who see Christianity as a key part of their identity, just as those few Muslims do. He was indeed making generalisations - like everyone does all the same, and which is a perfectly legitimate and necessary way to make observations.\n\nWhen you say\n&gt;He rationalises the disproportionate and murderously violent response of Islamic extremists to what are minor provocations.\n\nI wonder what connotations you're attaching to the word 'rationalises'. He is giving reasons as to why this might be the case, yes - but he isn't saying 'so it's fair enough'. Again, see the rain example: he simply never considers whether it's 'good' or not.\n\nSadly, I'm unlikely to be able to respond again - there's only so much time I can afford to give to reddit (responding to you was my first comment in ages). But if you don't understand after the above, then I don't think I could ever convey it. So: goodbye, and have a great 2014."

"If the Chinese government were smart they'd allow Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, China to be independent states bound together in a free trade area. They could invite Singapore in too.\n\nOf course if the British had been smart they'd have allowed America, Australia, Canada, India, Ireland, Scotland and England to have all had separate governments as people demanded them on the condition they join a free trade area back in the 1700's. As apparently Adam Smith suggested. \n\nhttp://conversableeconomist.blogspot.com/2013/07/adam-smith-on-economics-of-us.html\n\n&gt; Smith discussed various possibilities for how Great Britain might deal with its colonies. One proposal was that Great Britain should just \"voluntarily give up all authority over her colonies,\" which would then allow Britain and America, in friendship to benefit from free trade between them. But he despaired of this possibility.  \n&gt;\n&gt; \"To propose that Great Britain should voluntarily give up all authority over her colonies, and leave them to elect their own magistrates, to enact their own laws, and to make peace and war as they might think proper, would be to propose such a measure as never was, and never will be adopted, by any nation in the world. No nation ever voluntarily gave up the dominion of any province, how troublesome soever it might be to govern it, and how small soever the revenue which it afforded might be in proportion to the expence which it occasioned. Such sacrifices, though they might frequently be agreeable to the interest, are always mortifying to the pride of every nation, and what is perhaps of still greater consequence, they are always contrary to the private interest of the governing part of it, who would thereby be deprived of the disposal of many places of trust and profit, of many opportunities of acquiring wealth and distinction, which the possession of the most turbulent, and, to the great body of the people, the most unprofitable province seldom fails to afford. The most visionary enthusiast would scarce be capable of proposing such a measure with any serious hopes at least of its ever being adopted. If it was adopted, however, Great Britain would not only be immediately freed from the whole annual expence of the peace establishment of the colonies, but might settle with them such a treaty of commerce as would effectually secure to her a free trade, more advantageous to the great body of the people, though less so to the merchants, than the monopoly which she at present enjoys. By thus parting good friends, the natural affection of the colonies to the mother country which, perhaps, our late dissensions have well nigh extinguished, would quickly revive. It might dispose them not only to respect, for whole centuries together, that treaty of commerce which they had concluded with us at parting, but to favour us in war as well as in trade, and, instead of turbulent and factious subjects, to become our most faithful, affectionate, and generous allies ...\"\n\nOf course this is the model that America ended up adopting. You don't see them demanding more territory be added to the US.\n\nActually Smith's comment about the UK leaving American to \"leave them to elect their own magistrates, to enact their own laws, and to make peace and war as they might think proper\" pretty much sums up what Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong want."

"First if education cost was similar to a tax paid by the majority, which I'm not endorsing, would it be so terrible? I find it similar to alumni donating to their respected schools. \n\nI call for an open source education system started by volunteers. Similar to Kahn Academy and Coursera. I think current education establishments should post their staffs specific teachings online available to everyone. Once these classes and majors are transitioned online. Programs can be made to track where students are struggling. Student's not struggling in that area can help with their colleagues. Or mass classes can be taught to a group on a specific section via class time or online. As more and more are educated, the more and more the system builds by assigning projects and research and posting online via an open source system. Participating tax breaks for cooperative education with certain companies is another viable option to teach hands on learning.

Or have other security researchers found new evidence (that wasn't present in the NSA documents (that SPIEGEL has a copy of)) that tech companies were involved? Or is it just that \n[in his comment](https://twitter.com/DellCares/status/417812096072818688), Martijn Wismeijer believes that Dell is involved when in reality we don't really know? Maybe Dell is actually offering to provide a replacement part that lacks the extra hardware the NSA added?\n\nGranted, just because the NSA documents don't confirm Dell involvement, that doesn't mean Dell definitely isn't involved.

"Technically, the power of the states to self regulate is written in the constitution.

No, of course not. 1% is 1% too many. However, this isn't a perfect world and virtually every country has some percentage of its people living homeless. So 1% of the 317 million population of the US being homeless is statistically speaking, very good. *Especially* when compared to other countries with a similar population size.

"I appreciate your thoughtful response. The definitions of discrimination I am referring to come from the relevant scientific literature, so it is likely that wikipedia is presenting a simplified version. \n\nMoreover, the theoretical and empirical analysis of discrimination in the social sciences is distinct from the way in which U.S. law defines discrimination. One of the major problems with the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is that, under Title VI, discrimination is defined as prosecutable only if discriminatory *intent* can be demonstrated. Since this is extremely difficult to demonstrate without mind-reading machines, the law basically has no real teeth. For many years, discriminatory *outcomes* were also used in lawsuits brought against accused offenders, but in 2001 this practice was undermined by the Supreme Court decision in *Alexander v. Sandoval*, which found that outcomes alone are not sufficient for prosecution under Title VI.\n\nThis is important to some my own academic work in the field of environmental justice."

"&gt;First if education cost was similar to a tax paid by the majority, which I'm not endorsing, would it be so terrible? I find it similar to alumni donating to their respected schools. \n\n* Not everyone wants to go to school, making them pay for it is immoral.\n* Not everyone CAN go to school, making them pay for it is immoral.\n\n&gt;I call for an open source education system started by volunteers. Similar to Kahn Academy and Coursera.\n\nI don't disagree this would be a good thing to do for the world.  But it wouldn't solve any of your issues.  Employers will likely never recognize something like this, even if it were accredited.\n\nWhat you have to understand is that college is one part education, one part socialization, another part goal setting and obtainment and another part LEGAL DISCRIMINATION.\n\nYou'll never get the socialization, and the goal setting and obtainment is well... much more questionable done online.  And well you ignore the fact that schooling is a legalized form of discrimination. \n\nYou probably come from a near middle class or higher household, probably don't have criminal tenancies, and if you did your family did a good job of managing them.  \n\nBasically the entire process is to weed out people who are not obedient.  It's a process to break down people that want independence from the system by forcing them to adhere to it.\n\nIt is extremely unlikely that will change.  And honestly the system isn't flawed.  There's too many graduates and not enough jobs.  Economics dictates the cost of college should continue to rise. "
"&gt; My biggest fear is this. Will the cost of living just adjust for this?\n\nIf by adjust you mean \"change at all\" then yes, but if by adjust you mean \"increase as much as the increase in aggregate consumer income\" then no.\n\nIncreases in actual cost of production would be limited and much smaller in aggregate than the increase in consumer income in aggregate.  At the same time, demand would be stimulated increasing sales turnover for goods and services characterized by elastic demand.   \n\nThe biggest increases in the cost of production would be for goods and services that are highly reliant on low paying jobs, but the increased costs would be lower than the increase in consumer buying power, as would be price increased premised on the increased costs.  The increase costs would also be increased income directed at low income earners which will fuel even more consumer demand (increases in income for low incomers is highly stimulatory because as an aggregate this group immediately spends nearly all of any increase in its aggregate income).\n\n&gt; Will people getting this income just become the new poor when employers and landlords just adjust for it?\n\nNo.  Employers will be constrained by market forces.  Raising prices without any correlated increase in the cost of production is likely to result in your goods and services having an unjustifiably higher price tag than that of your competitors'.  If your competitors also hike their prices, then the entire market will have a bloated margin that will invite new players to enter on the premise that they can supply the same good or service at a much lower price while achieving a profit.  Businesses have to consider not only whether the market can afford their prices, but also whether or not the prices will be undercut by a competitor leaving the business with a reduced market share that shrinks revenues to the point where the business is less profitable despite higher per unit prices and profit margins.\n\nInflation is not a boogeyman.  Referencing Zimbabwe in this context is more superstitious than illuminating.  "

"My Mum cut this article out for me 'Rush to immunise children as our vaccine campaign hits home' The Telegraph 28 Dec 2013, (link to article below) as I don't often read the papers and she knows I have had a huge personal battle in deciding what to do about immunisation for my youngest child - what society expects me to or what my gut tells me too. I decided to come online and find the article and leave a comment as I feel it my responsibility to help others and share my opinion, decisions and suggestions on 'The Immunisation Issue'.\n\nI am not in either camp, the for or against but I do think the Government needs to make some sensible decisions and changes before we either end up with a Measles epidemic and unnecessary lost lives or the rates of Autism go even further through the roof. If anyone reading this knows anyone in Government who has the power to enact change I would be happy to speak with them. I don't have a perfect solution, but I have thoroughly researched immunisation and given all opinions and research a tremendous amount of thought and consider myself educated on the issue. The decision to immunise, when and against what should be individual for each child depending on the state of their overall health and in particular their immune system, and immunisations should not be lumped into single shots to save money/for convenience - it is dangerous. We are humans not robots and the Government has the responsibility to give people the choice and make the safest options available. NZ &amp; Japan do it.\n\nI have called everywhere in Australia I could think of to see if it was possible to have the vaccines administered individually - immunisation board, childrens hospital immunisation departments statewide, asked every doctor I have come into contact with - and been told it is not possible in Australia. After posting a similar post to this one yesterday on Facebook, I have found out that it is possible and the individual vaccines for the MMR at least can be ordered through your local council. \n\nTo outline my own situation and in the hope of avoiding any negative comments. I have a healthy fully immunised 4yr old (still to have her 4yr old MMR booster just waiting on doctors appointment and approval) and a 2yr old that has had a lot of gut trouble and I have delayed her immunisations from 6mths when I became aware of her gut/health issues and while I have been searching for a progressive open minded medical professional to help me with her gut and the immunisation decision - which thankfully after 18mths I have finally found. Once her doctor deems she is well enough I plan on immunising her with individual immunisations against the diseases her doctor recommends. I was planning on traveling to New Zealand to do this or to the Japanese clinic in Singapore but by the sounds of it maybe it is possible in Australia... I will be calling the local council tomorrow to confirm.\n\nOn the No Jab No Play campaign, the GP I got a Conscientious Objection form from I had never met before, she was lovely and had no issue in giving me one with very little questioning as to why I was conscientiously objecting or how well informed I was on the topic. I got the impression that they were potentially as easy to get as a medical certificate often is for a sicky.... All these new rules are going to do is weed out the parents who either haven't prioritised immunising their children and if I were the Government I would be questioning if those rushing to immunise were fit to be parents...... just a thought. Or pressure those who are torn by what to do into making a potentially harmful decision. Those who have decided not to immunise for either legitimate or illegitimate reasons.... potentially even because their next door neighbour didn't and they are keeping up with the Jones's so to speak.... will be easily able to get a Conscientious Objection.\n\nhttp://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/rush-to-immunise-children-as-our-vaccine-campaign-hits-home/story-fni0cx12-1226791067956#social-comments\n\nBest regards\nZoey McGill\n"

"As far as I know the liquor control board has pretty much figured out all of the regulations. They might still be figuring a few things out but I'm not sure. What they're doing now is going through all the retail license applications they have received and will soon approve stores, which will then be able to open in March. We're on our way, but we're moving slowly compared to Colorado.\n\nColorado did it in a better way IMO, and not just because they did it faster. They streamlined the process by just giving the retail licenses to already existing dispensaries, which is good because that means people with experience in running a pot shop will be the first to open. As far as I know they also didn't limit the grow ops the same way Washington did. For whatever reason none of the grow ops were allowed to use any existing supply from medical marijuana, they were required to source their own seeds/clones/etc. in November and start fresh. Our liquor control board also decided that they needed to change the laws around medical marijuana for no reason. They tried to remove medical marijuana patients right to grow, they caught a lot of shit for that, so instead they further limited how many plants they can grow."

It's idealistic and somewhat of a Utopian dream. With an open source education system your collaborating with people all over the globe. what if we transitioned the responsibility of innovation and production to our developing learning minds. If we taught our students to collaborate and learn the products and technology we have today, tested them to innovate and create, to develop better products and technology for tomorrow. Then as each generation creates, they can maintain, until the new generation creates something better. slowly creating a world of sustainability and innovation. \n\n"

"Well you're ignoring one other element here.  That there are more college educated people than jobs that need a college education (generally).  There are of course some fields that still need plenty of people.\n\nProgrammers, AI, robotics, biomedical and chem etc.\n\nThe cost of education is partly about balancing this out.  If everyone in the entire world had a PHD, everyone would be worth minimum wage.  Think about it.  The economics of working capital and profit drive people's values as employees.  If everyone was supra qualified, everyone would basically be worthless.\n\nLot's of people decide not to attend college because they don't think they can succeed and may incur debt they can't pay back.  That is a good thing.  Lot's of people decide they don't want the debt.  That is a good thing.  It creates balance between the supply of jobs and the demand for those jobs by people with degrees. \n\nDebt is a rational way to handle another problem.  The fact that life is inherently unfair.  I don't know what kind of family you were born into, but my dad was born into a lower middle class family and he created a middle class family and the family I'm starting is upper middle\\upper class.\n\nDebt is a way for someone who is poor to get a chance to become someone who is not poor.  \n\nI do systems analysis to make a living and I honestly think it's a pretty fair system.

"&gt;Burden of proof... lol. I was on topic, and everything I've said is directly related to cost. It's obvious that you don't know much about military logistics and operational costs. That's why you keep avoiding the numbers of strikes and their relation to the number of current ground operations.\n\nRepeating the statements doesn't make it so. \n\n&gt;Keep reading my post over and over again until you get it. Troop strength has a cost associated with each additional individual deployed. The same can be said for developing cross border operations and the additional contingency costs associated with operations conducted in enemy held territory.\nEach strike, ground strike or drone strike raises the total cost. You didn't verbalize it well, but you surmise that each missile would cost more than an individua ground strike. I'm saying the overall costs of maintaining those ground operations is higher day to day, month to month, and year to year.\n\nYou didn't show me anything relevant to this though. You didn't source any information. You omitted the fact that those costs still exist with or without sending soldiers in. Those analysts and soldiers still get paid the same amount. Weapons and fuel costs are the only added costs for such strikes.\n\n&gt;I'm saying the overall costs of maintaining those ground operations is higher day to day, month to month, and year to year.\n\nThat's not relevant though. Even if there was no strike at all those costs would still go up. Those aren't costs of the strikes themselves they're simply the cost of being in the region and the cost of paying for manpower.\n\n&gt;while I'm talking about real policy.\n\nI know you're talking about real policy. So am I. The difference is that the policy you're talking about is not relevant to the discussion at hand. It has nothing to do with the strikes themselves but the operational costs of being in the region.\n\n&gt;Either way, take this to your advisors and see what they think. \n\nThey're quite amused at how poorly you constructed your argument actually. You really weren't a very good opponent in the slightest. After all your entire arguments were based on either emotional appeals or red herring fallacies."

"Listen. In the West, people have a hugely distorted view of Islam and Muslims. They just know that 9/11 happened and then stories that are put on the news that have to do with crazy wackos. That's all the average American knows about Islam and they tend to think that the word \"terrorist\" is synonymous with \"muslim\". It's sad. \n\nMuslims in America are very much so marginalized. Christians are not. Christians are the majority. An American can make fun of Christians and people will not feel offended because most likely, that guy is Christian, has Christian family, OR the audience will take the joke at face value and realize its just a stupid joke.\n\nPeople are so scared of Muslims and know very little about them (this thread itself proves how little people know about islam) and their history. Making fun of a marginalized and misunderstood group is not even close to the same as making a joke about Christians. Stop saying \"oh Christians can take it so why can't Muslims?\" It's a poor comparison. Muslim jokes and stories about terrorism are more popular and widely heard than actual facts and understanding about the vast majority of the religion. That is what perpetuates misunderstanding and stereotypes.\n\nOf course, killing someone over a joke is obviously insane and wrong. Thats never okay. But dig deeper and realize there's more to things. It's so distasteful to make fun of a marginalized and severely misunderstood group. It's nothing like making fun of americans or Christians in America. "

"&gt; They stopped because the wall went up.

"&gt;Who set those 'legal' rules? The Arabs living there, or the British? \n\nThe British, who were the ruler of the land. I don't know however if they consulted the Arab Muslims in the beginning.

Before, during and especially after the 1936-39 Arab Revolt the resistance to Jewish immigration grew a lot and that point I'm quite sure the British did not consult the Arab Muslims.\n\nWhen the Arab resentment towards Jew immigration grew, the British did however limit the immigration and eventually, if I remember right, put a full ban on immigration which resulted on 100,000 Jewish immigrants waiting to be let in to Israel.\n\n&gt;If you are an occupier, how are you at the same time a civilian.\n\nBecause the term \"civilian\" only means \"a person who is not a member of the military or of a police or firefighting force\", there are a lot of people in Israel who are not members of the military, even on reserve.\n\n&gt;occupying something that is not yours.\n\nThat applies to 99 % of the people in North, Central and South America, and dozens of other countries throughout the World.\n\nLegit question, do you think these (European descent) people should leave Americas so that the Natives can go back to their lands?\n\nAlso, you didn't answer my question:\n\n&gt;Are you implying it is somehow ok to murder civilians even if they are \"occupiers\"?"

"&gt;As an Israeli, and a former soldier in the IDF i served in gaza. During my entire service time i have never seen a fellow soldier mistreat a palestinian. We were constatly told and taught to behave in respect even under the harsh situation.\n\nYou're probably right.  But the fact that there is a widespread oppression that you are building up doesnt' excuse the fact that you were polite.  You could politely build an open air prison, go ahead.\n\n&gt;The biggest problem with the world today regarding israel is people keep shouting things like apartheid, and the gaza residents dont have electricity.\n\n...but that's exactly what's happening.  Maybe not technically, since the West Bank and Gaza aren't part of Israel.  Imperialism is probably a better term.  Doesn't make it any less wrong.\n\n&gt;RT news is so anti-israeli alot of times the show the reality in a twisted way.\n\nYeah, but all American news (and the news of America's allies) are just as bias for Israel.  It's international news, of course there are agendas.  You still gotta find the truth through it all.\n\n&gt;Most of us here dont even like the goverment.\n\nAnd most of you don't even discuss the treatment of the Palestinians.  It's a cultural taboo.  Good people doing nothing while evil people do evil things.\n\n&gt;We do send supplies to the people of gaza, israel is one of the top countries to help in humanterian crisis, haiti, turkey, japan fukishima, and the latest crisis in the phillipins.\n\nWell, a lot of that money is from the US.  Giving people other people's money doesn't really mean anything.\n\nBesides, any country that gives aid does so because of an agenda.  No government on earth would act morally unless there was an agenda.  The government told you to behave, because if you didn't, it would stall Israel's expansion.  Israel would gladly do a full scale invasion of all it's neighbors if it could get away with it.  That's nothing specific to Israel, it's the nature of governments/nations.\n\n&gt;We even have an anti air missle defence system guarding the gaza power station in case some fanatic anti hamas will try and bomb it.\n\nI don't believe that.  Source that isn't Israeli?\n\n&gt;Jews and israel are very hated around the world\n\nYes, but the hatred from Muslims came at Israel's formation.  For 1500 years before that, Jews were treated better in Muslim lands, and basically left to govern themselves.  What changed?  Jews from Europe claimed land in Palestine was theirs, and killed/displaced people to steal that land.  Even at the expense of non-European Jews.\n\n&gt;Im not saying dont belive everything or do belive. Im saying check the facts. If anyone has photos of those torture cages please post them to shut me up\n\nThese cages seem a bit extreme, Israel wouldn't want to be caught doing this.  But Israel's track record makes this type of thing believable.  See the problem, now?  "

The application window closed last week, but board spokesman Mikhail Carpenter said there is still a backlog of submissions that haven’t been processed yet.\n\n&gt; Investigators have already started reviewing applicants, and the state hopes to begin issuing licenses at the end of February. Applicants must undergo background checks, be residents of Washington state, and have their business areas inspected by the state.\n\n&gt; Along with 1,670 producer applications and 1,209 processor applications, the state has released details on 867 proposed retail outlets. The state is planning to cap the number of pot shops at 334 statewide, so some areas are expected to face a lottery for retail licenses.\n\n&gt; After the first licenses are issued, the state expects it will take some time for marijuana to move through the system from production to sale."

To date, most Iranian men in Iran have retained the Western-style long-sleeved collared shirt and three-piece suit, while excluding the necktie. The majority of Iranian men abroad wear neckties.[21]"

"&gt; Watch the presentation, tech companies have left their firmware open deliberately for the NSA\n\nYou interpret the presentation a lot differently than I do. I did not see any point at which the presentation claims that tech companies are for sure doing this deliberately. It definitely does *question* whether they might be, but it leaves it open for discussion whether the NSA is colluding with manufacturers or merely discovering exploits and hoarding them rather than reporting them.\n\nFor example, when discussing the Dell RAID attack [at 43m10s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0w36GAyZIA#t=43m10s), he mentions DEITYBOUNCE and says a lot of \"why is that?\" stuff about Dell, but he doesn't go into detail about whether the listed BIOS versions have vulnerabilities baked into them deliberately or accidentally. The fact that it lists versions doesn't mean anything, because vulnerabilities usually come with a list of versions that can be exploited.\n\n(He mentions Dell again, [at 54m28s in the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0w36GAyZIA#t=54m28s), and says the exploit uses the JTAG interface. JTAG is a hardware interface for debugging and testing hardware. To me, it's reasonable that a manufacturer would include this. It is standard practice to include JTAG. People who put custom firmware on their wireless routers use JTAG to unbrick devices, for example, as [this OpenWRT page describes](http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/hardware/port.jtag).)\n\nAnd when he discusses Apple [at 44m50s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0w36GAyZIA#t=44m50s), he specifically calls out that he does not know whether Apple helped or not:\n\n&gt; Do you think Apple helped them with that? I don't know. I hope Apple will clarify that. I think it's really important that Apple doesn't. Here's a problem: I don't really believe that Apple didn't help them, I can't prove it, yes, but they literally claim that any time they target an iOS device that it will succeed for implantation. Either they have a huge collection of exploits that work against Apple products (meaning that they are hoarding information about critical systems that American companies produce and sabotaging them) or Apple sabotaged it themselves. Not sure which one it is. I'd like to believe that since Apple didn't join the PRISM program until after Steve Jobs died, that maybe it's just that they write shitty software. We know know that's true.\n\nHe gets a laugh from the shitty software thing, but he is trying to make a point that maybe there are enough holes in shitty software that the government doesn't really need Apple's cooperation. He also makes a point later that hoarding exploits is bad, because others can and will find them.\n\nThen listen how he describes an HP vulnerability [at 50m27s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0w36GAyZIA#t=50m27s):\n\n&gt; It's another American company that they are sabotaging. They understand that HP's servers are vulnerable, and they decided, instead of explaining that this is a problem, they exploit it.\n\nBy saying \"explaining that this is a problem\", he is suggesting that HP did not know about the vulnerability and that the NSA is acting without HP's help.\n\nHe uses that as a lead-in to his point (at [51m22s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0w36GAyZIA#t=51m22s)) about how Obama's stated policy is inconsistent with what the NSA is doing:\n\n&gt; President Obama's own advisory board that was convened to understand the scope of these things has even agreed with me about this point, that this should not be taking place. That hoarding of zero-day exploits cannot simply happen without thought processes that are reasonable and rational\n\nThe key phrase here is \"hoarding of zero-day exploits\". A zero-day exploit is not the same thing as a backdoor.\n\nTL;DR: As far as I can tell the presentation does not give any evidence that there are deliberate backdoors. There may be, but it's also possible they are just exploiting unintentional vulnerabilities, and the presentation says this."

Trivial amounts don't kill someone.\n\nTrivial amounts of explosives most certainly kill people when their blast energy is focused.

"\"You are also right.\"\n\n-a famous Hassidic joke-\n\nMax and Isaac come to the Rabbi's study to settle a dispute.  The Rabbi's wife is also seated in the room.\n\nMax explains his complaint to the Rabbi:  the story is such and so, and he has to do this and he has to do that.  He gives a fine account and argues his case clearly. The Rabbi declares, \"You're right, Max.\" \n\nNext, Isaac presents his side.  He speaks with such passion and persuasion that the Rabbi says to him, \"You're right, Isaac.\" \n\nAfter they leave, the Rabbi's wife is distraught and says to her husband, \"They have conflicting stories.  How can you say that both of them are right?  When one wins, the other must lose.\"\n\nThe Rabbi thinks long and hard and finally says to his wife, \"You know, you're right.\"\n\n"
"This story reads completely differently to me than the original.\n\nIn the original BBC story it sounded as though he'd been mugged on the street and had his possessions stolen.\n\nThis story reads that he was out drinking with strangers, went to a hotel room with them, they got violent and he left, leaving his bag behind.\n\nThere's much more to this story than \"charity runner mugged in Banff\"."

"&gt; The British, who were the ruler of the land.\n\nSo a ruler who came in by force, is going to make what is 'legal' and not 'legal' and then force it as rule of the land. And when the population doesnt want it, we blame the population. \n\n&gt; I don't know however if they consulted the Arab Muslims in the beginning.\n\nThey didn't. Who in their right minds would allow foreigners to come and settle willy nilly in their region? Even in the USA, and the most liberal of all all countries you will find, immigration is a very, very sensitive topic, with strict guidelines and constraints.\n\n&gt; Before, during and especially after the 1936-39 Arab Revolt the resistance to Jewish immigration grew a lot and that point I'm quite sure the British did not consult the Arab Muslims.\n\nIt has nothing to do with Arab Muslims. If you come in and make laws willy nilly without consultation, you are a dictator. So everything you say \"legal\", its means \"What the dictator dictated as law\". \n\n&gt;Because the term \"civilian\" only means \"a person who is not a member of the military or of a police or firefighting force\", \n\nSo what? Are they occupying or not?\n\n&gt; there are a lot of people in Israel who are not members of the military, even on reserve.\n\nAgain so what? Are they occupying or not?\n\n&gt; That applies to 99 % of the people in North, Central and South America, and dozens of other countries throughout the World.\n\nNo. Because those democratic countries have not based their nations on ethnicity and/or religion.\n\n&gt; Legit question, do you think these (European descent) people should leave Americas so that the Natives can go back to their lands?\n\nNo. Do people of European descent now, actively want a country based on their ethnicity/religion, and violently keep the natives out, _based on that_? If yes, then they need to GTFO, like what happened to South Africa, yes. If not, then no, there is no problem. \n\n&gt; Are you implying it is somehow ok to murder civilians even if they are \"occupiers\"?\n\nMurder or fighting with whatever means necessary? Also, \"Occupiers\" or Occupiers? Clarify your question. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

"&gt; You interpret the presentation a lot differently than I do. I did not see any point at which the presentation claims that tech companies are for sure doing this deliberately. It definitely does question whether they might be, but it leaves it open for discussion whether the NSA is colluding with manufacturers or merely discovering exploits and hoarding them rather than reporting them.\n\nYou should refer to the accompanying info provided in the Der Spiegel article written by Appelbaum and pay special attention to the independent research presented at Ohm 2013 referenced by Appelbaum regarding deliberate back-door access discovered in NICs which you seem to have overlooked in your detailed listing to the topics in the talk that are not directly relevant to the discussion we are having.\n\n"
"Except you are not talking about a single frog, you are talking about several hundreds of millions of individuals ([current estimates say 1.6 **billion**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_world)), the majority of whom are already peaceful. We may not agree with some of their laws or culture, but that doesn't limit our ability to live peacefully side by side.\n\nUnfortunately, amongst those billions, there are a small percentage (for example: of that 1.6 billion, 0.01% still leaves 160,000 individuals) who are more fanatical and wiling to go to extreme lengths to push an agenda. Should the billions be punished in order to limit the tiny minority?\n\nMaybe the frog doesn't notice when it is being slowly cooked, but I think that 1.6 billion people are likely to get upset about having the same principle applied to them in order to control a tiny minority. The challenge is that their culture and society needs to evolve in order to reject violence as a solution. However that can only happen when peace is encouraged, because if they are constantly surrounded by violence, then they will always revert to nationalism and violence in response. \n\nThat is a basic human instinct. When a person (or culture, or nation) is threatened, fight or flight is triggered. If there is nowhere to flee to, then only fight remains an option. And in an era of instantaneous communication, constant images from around the world of drone bombings, army occupations, shootings and destruction only fans that fear and increases the probability of retaliation."

I hear the most privileged, spoiled, entitled people spouting this line because they are Jewish. \n\nI'll grant you that Israel is pretty disliked, because it treats non-Jews as sub human. This is not unique to Israel, you'll find many countries are disliked for this reason, and it's easily rectified. \n\nAs for \"Jews are very hated\", try being Palestinian. Or black in the US.

"Islam is not the only religion that is believed to punish those who don't believe...Are you familiar with *Dante Aligheri's Divine Comedy?* That book follows the path of a Christian Italian during the 12th century, in which he basically sends many Jewish, and Muslim figures to hell, while only sending Christians to heaven...\n\nPretty much all of the 3 major monotheistic religions insist that people part of their religion SOLELY, will end up in heaven, while everyone else ends up in hell. Islam isn't the only one.  "

"What a load of alarmist tripe.\n\nCouple of points:\n\n&gt;Islam is not and never was a religion of peace. Historically, most of Islam has been spread by the sword, by fear and intimidation. Look it up.\n\nWe can chalk this up to geopolitical factors more than anything. The Middle East of the 7th century was dominated by Sassanid Persia and the Byzantine Empire, powerful, confrontational states with highly institutionalized religions already established. \n\nCarving out a place for yourself in that time period required you to get your hands dirty, and with great power comes great ambition. Having united the Arabs for the first time in ages, Muhammad had access to a tremendous amount of power. \n\nThat he united the Arabs under a new religion was incidental. Muhammad could have been *any* successful warlord of *any* faith, and he and his immediate successors would have expanded with just as much enthusiasm and fervor as they did.\n\n&gt;Even today, you don't have to look any further than London to see the true face of fundamental Islam.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anecdotal_evidence\n\nLook, fuckers are everywhere. Fuckers abound. Fuckers aplenty. Lots of these fuckers decide to use religion to make the world a shittier place. (Hell, a lot of fuckers don't even bother with that!) This isn't unique to Islam.\n\n&gt;No other faith or culture sanctions murder as the appropriate response to \"insults\".\n\nWrong. Sorry, that's just wrong. Indians and Africans of all faiths have engaged in honor killings.  Can't be arsed to provide links, but these stories abound.\n\n&gt;Islam is not likely to change because the \"moderates\" do not dare to speak out since they would face the same fate as any \"Kafir\".\n\nJesus, plenty of moderate groups have been forming over the years. Plenty more than in years previous, too.\n\nIslam is not a static faith, it is dynamic, and has undergone several changes in the past millennium. \n\nMuslims are experiencing the *exact same pressures* that modernity and globalization have brought on all populations, and are essentially having *the exact same reactions*. I mean, put yourself in their shoes: to a pre-modern society, can you just *imagine* what \"The Jersey Shore\" represents to these people? It's scary stuff, man. But, you know, whatever, the kids make \"kafir\" friends, or at least get out and read a book once and a while, boom, they just find Snooki distasteful like the rest of civilized society rather than the goddamn Whore of Babylon.\n\nAlso, another point: Can you tell me who the \"leader\" of Islam is? Who's the Muslim Pope? Nobody. There's no leader. There's no Muslim Dalai Lama. The Caliphate is no more. It's an *extremely* decentralized faith.\n\n*And that's a good thing.* It means that, in fact, there *are* people speaking out, nobody enforcing an orthodoxy (beyond, you know, morality police in places like Iran and Saudi Arabia, but fuck those guys, nobody likes them, not even Iranians and Arabs. Especially not them). Thank goodness it's just a bunch of radical so-called imams with internet access.\n\n&gt;Bottom line: At some point the west will have to say enough, and everyone will have to choose sides.

FISA also prevents them from collecting Americans' data that is transmitted on foreign lines.\n\nThis is the NSA's job and they are doing it correctly. Your concern is overexaggerated and doesn't hold up evidence regarding spying on citizens and it is incorrect to blame the NSA for spying on allies because that is something the State Department signed off on."

We live in 2013, and the status quo of world economy does not allow such abrupt breaking in trading links as that between Hong Kong and China.\n\nEconomically mutual benefiting trades happen every second between China, Taiwan, and Japan, and yet they all have deeply entrenched hatred towards each other.

They don't expect everything they do online to be given to the NSA. \n\n Anyway, I think you're missing the point.

It's that the NSA has such disregard for privacy that they are even doing it for trivial things where a person is only on the plane for a few hours.\n\n"

"&gt; HK's economy depends on China, and that will be the final say on all matters: ultimately, HK people need China to put food on their table. \n\nThe idea that independence from China would result in an 100% destruction of trade is an intentionally misleading idea — to be independent from China is not the same as being at war with China.  We live in 2013, and the status quo of world economy does not allow such abrupt breaking in trading links as that between Hong Kong and China.\n\nEconomically mutual benefiting trades happen every second between China, Taiwan, and Japan, and yet they all have deeply entrenched hatred towards each other.

"&gt; You should refer to the accompanying info provided in the Der Spiegel article \n\nYes, let's refer to [that article](http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/catalog-reveals-nsa-has-back-doors-for-numerous-devices-a-940994.html). Jacob Appelbaum, the same person who gave the presentation, is the first author listed.\n\nThe article says:\n\n&gt; There is **no information in the documents** seen by SPIEGEL to suggest that the companies whose products are mentioned in the catalog provided any support to the NSA **or even had any knowledge** of the intelligence solutions.\n\nYou can see why I'm having a problem here, right? You're telling me to refer to an article to back up your point that companies were directly involved, but it is telling me the exact opposite of what you're saying.\n\nSince Applebaum himself is saying there isn't evidence, if you think there is, can you please point out the SPECIFIC WORDS OR PASSAGES that you think are evidence?"
"&gt; So you admit they have historical precedence for living there?\n\nThe Jews (Israelites) were not the only peoples inhabiting the Levant in ancient times.\n\nAlso, they were expelled first by the Babylonians, then later by the Romans. It has been two to three thousand years since the end of the biblical Jewish kingdoms. Since then two additional, and both more dominant, religions have sprung out of the same area and countless empires have held that land. For the past 1500 years, that area has been mostly dominated by the Muslims, with a few crusader kingdoms here and there. Your people lost. The Jews aren't the first group in history to have lost their homeland. It's happened to the Hmong and I'm sure many others. But it was over two thousand years ago. Get over it. \n\nAnd to be honest, I could care less about religion. If anything, the Holy Land should be available to visitors of all three faiths if they want to go visit the holy sites, pray and do whatever else but the Jews and the Christians outside of that land have no claim to it and neither have a right to move in from abroad and form their own states.\n\nThat said, what's done is done. Israel is there and isn't going anywhere, at least not anytime soon. Both sides have to learn to live with each other, but a lot of that burden falls on the shoulders of the Israelis since they have all the power in this situation.\n\n&gt; Saudi Arabia, pretty much all of the middle east. \n\nIbn Saud created that kingdom less than a hundred years ago from lands Arabian tribes have inhabited since before the rise of Muhammad and Islam. Arabs did not immigrate en masse from abroad to create the kingdom.\n\nThe Hashemites in Jordan (and previously Iraq) trace their lineage back to the 600s and the Arabs conquered the entire region during that time period as well. That is why Arabic is spoken from the southern (North Africa) and eastern shores of the Mediterranean to the western shores of the Indian Ocean/Arabian Sea. \n\nIran has been a nation or empire in one form or another since well before Christ's time (Zoroastrianism predates Judaism as well and was the dominant religion in the first Persian empires).

"the comparisons offered in this article are flawed, but the conclusion is likely sound- as deduced by comparing China's motive for restricting journalism to N.Korea's. North Korea is more concerned about what info comes into their country, and China is more concerned about what info goes out of their country. Heres why it's true and why that determines how much journalism each restricts: \n\nNorth Korea is economically and diplomatically isolated enough that they need not care as much about exported info contributing to their image on the world stage. All one needs to do is review their recent behavior to conclude that they dont care much about their global image. But they are also united(albeit by disinformation) and to stave off future disunity, they are more concerned about imported information their citizens hear- they do not want their citizens to know how limited their lives are and what the rest of the world thinks of the country's leadership. When visiting that country, you must be very careful what you are witnessed saying to common citizens. Since foreign journalists cannot publish within N. Korea, and the gov't is otherwise unconcerned about their global image, they have little more concern about journalists than they would be have of any other visitor- since the only way to convey imported info is to tell individual citizens.\n\nBy comparison, China already faces rebellious challenge from Tibet and has to maintain its image as trading partners look on. China would, by all reason, be more concerned about what pressure they encounter from the free world as a result of info leaking out. They dont worry so much about imported info that Tibetans and all else know of. Unlike N. Korea, they do have concern about their global image, and therefore concern over what info gets out of Tibet. \n\n "
"Ok this is a question I would love to answer. This is why Israelis feel insulted by the media sometimes. We are an extremely self reflective culture. We have a low tolerance for human rights abuses. There is an expression, \"two Jews, three opinions.\" Our court system is designed to prevent discrimination and torture. We feel that the very fact that we have such a court system and a self critical media is unique in the Middle East. And we hope you won't use our own introspection and desire to correct ourselves against us. In other words, we want some credit for the fact that we do prosecute people who are out of line with humanitarian norms. We want some recognition that although our nation is not perfect, and struggles with religious war, we are trying to make laws that make it a secular egalitarian society. \nOther than that, using the holocaust or Apartheid against us is insulting as well because we as a nation did more to help Mandella than harm him.\nYes we have crazies to answer for. But no nation wants to only hear constantly about it's failures as a justification for it's destruction when there are abject failures all over the Middle East that do much, much worse."

"These are charges made by the Israeli government, correct?  The same government that puts children in prison?

The people North Korea puts in labor camps are considered traitors (their parents and children too).  The militants that fought (and fight) against apartheid in South Africa were called terrorists by their white colonial overlords. \n\nIsrael is dystopian fascist state that has invested its military in an endless war on a group of people who don't want to be Israeli, all because of territorial borders designed by the British after WWII.\n\nIf you want to change my mind, information coming from Israel won't do, try third party interpretations of the situation.

"Biologist-anthropologist here, and I work with endangered animals in Africa (not elephants). My suggestion for stopping this is to flood the illegal ivory market (in Asia, and also the U.S., which is the 2nd largest market for illegal ivory) with faux ivory made from a material that is harmful to humans. After the first few hundred times someone got grievously sick from handling a tainted ivory object the demand would drop rapidly. Likewise with rhino horn. Flood the oriental medicine market with poisoned faux rhino horn. Watch demand drop off. It is all about a cultural change. I'm fine with killing large numbers of poachers, but everyone here who said the market is the issue is dead-on correct. Dirt-poor Africans just aren't looking at the larger picture. There isn't anything wrong with killing them as a short term solution, but there needs to be a sea-change on the consumption end that can really only be brought about by making the product undesirable.
