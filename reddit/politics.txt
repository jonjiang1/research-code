But you do parrot those Fox News talking points beautifully.\n\n&gt;  Of course everything ends and then the market corrects and smooths out.\n\nSo, what you're saying is that the sky does fall but everything comes back to right? I would suggest that the ancient Greeks probably believed much like you to but history has proven time and time again, you are simply looking at too short a timeline. And the problem with that is you have no idea where on the timeline you are.\n\n&gt; The move to a mechanized society also lifted more people out of poverty than anything else in history.\n\nI don't think that claim can be made. Yes, it gets bandied around a lot but no one can seem to prove it. We have more people living in poverty now then existed back in the 1930s. Now, if you want to claim that this assertion  is based on percentages, I'm still not sure it can be quantified.\n\n&gt; some were harmed, but the vast majority were better. it is impossible to argue against that.\n\nI can argue that and do so quite convincingly.\n\nAt one point we had millions of people who were living a somewhat comfortable life and then had it torn out from under them. Are we as a whole better off then we were? One would have to ask by what set of metrics you make that claim. Are we happier then we were back then, less dependent, healthier? We have more material possessions, our technology has improved and our ability to keep people alive longer - but better off? I'm not seeing it."

That rate has been around for quite a while, but so has the current liquidity trap.\n\nFurthermore, neither you and I are going to qualify for a 3.9% small business loan unless we have rock solid collateral (real estate or cash).  If you're starting a business you're looking at funding it with multiple credit card accounts, or a loan that is going to be in the 10% APR range at best, unless you have collateral.\n\nI don't disagree with everything you say, but interest rates have to be placed on context, and there's a huge difference between business lending (high risk) and auto finance (near zero risk due to the front-end down payment and the liquidity of repossessed cars offsetting the potential default write-down)."

They were just really unhappy about being in school and merely refused to do the work. I always did what I could to help them if they were willing but in most cases I would just agreed with them that school was bullshit and that none of these people imprisoning us were deserving of taxpayer money to do so.\n\ntl;dr\nThey are competitive because the students are richer and better prepared to self-learn.

"How? Voters will never be 100% complicit because they never have the opportunity to vote for their perfect candidate, just the most sufficient for their views.

"An economy where each individual worker owns *an equal* share of his/her place of employment and financial institution as each of the other coworkers/co-owners. Shareholders are now exclusively employees, not 3rd-party entities. Beyond that constraint, feel free to run wild, compete with other companies that are owned and operated solely by their employees. Capitalism is rigged for the people who have capital. It starts out fair, in the beginning, when no one has any capital, but early winners begin to emerge, wealth accumulates over generations, creating a small group of owners, with an overwhelmingly larger (and growing) group of workers. Small business owners can stay in the game at first, but eventually they're beaten out too by, say, the low prices of Walmart's low-quality products, and so, rather than working for themselves, they are now out of business and looking for work. Now that small business owner has little choice but to go work for some other business owner, generating profit for them and being rewarded with only a piece of that profit, rather than all of it, like they once had. Certainly this amounts to much less than what he would make if he owned an equal share of the new business that he now works at."

"I'd say its pretty unpersuasive. Tax rates in the US are generally at a historic low. A major political push to avoid the deficit is crippling government hiring (and thus making it the primary contributor to high unemployment as private hiring has rebounded) and putting poor people at risk. If you want to look at it simplistically the obvious conclusion would be that lower taxes and controlled inflation cause recessions (I don't really believe this but that's the simplistic conclusion, not that taxes for medicaid are crippling anybody)."

"I am one of those in Texas. Between jobs so I do not qualify for a subsidy because my income level falls below the Federal Poverty Line. Do not qualify for Medicaid because I have more than 2K in resources (ie. my car that I will need when I secure a job) and they did not expand the program here. Health insurance through the exchange is $170.00/ month for the most basic plan with an incredibly high deductible (like $6,000+). My plan this year was $100/ month and a $5,000 deductible. That plan dies today and I just can't afford the $70 extra a month so I go without insurance until a new job comes through. I have worked for the majority of my life but have come to a place where I'm both a) jobless and b) low on resources. So I could really use the assistance during what I hope will be a short period of time where I'm out of a job (but who really knows how long that will actually end up being)? I definitely feel like I was the one left out- I guess I see there are 5 million others like me unfortunately. Just amazing that the one time in my life I truly legitimately need the help and it's just not there because of this gap. Definitely feeling like the people who designed Obamacare did not pay attention to the details and made bad assumptions- and here we are. Not trying to hate- just looking at the current situation and the results. 5 million people who are below the poverty level with their income are stuck out with no subsidy to help out and unable to qualify for Medicaid coverage.

It's inevitable and just for some to rise up. People such as the founders of Google and Apple - they are brilliant people who worked very hard. Their parents put them into a situation where they could succeed. There can only be so many of these people. They became fantastically rich because they provided incredible products to society. Remember that YOU gained from what they did too, because you use their amazing products.\n\n&gt; How is the baby that you talked about supposed to buy land/resources when they have to compete with generations of wealth accumulation? \n\nHuh?

Are you unaware of the fact that new millionaires are made all the time? 80% of all millionaires are first generation millionaires.\n\nHell, you can buy property extremely cheaply. A few hundred dollars per acre.\n\n&gt; In a perfect vacuum, yes buying things with hard earned and equally valuable currency is the most fair. But in practice it just doesn't work out like that. After time, it simply turns into a very small segment of the population exploiting all the rest.\n\n\"Exploiting\" is a word that is used as an emotional appeal. You work at someone else's company and earn a wage. You make products that other people buy. You signed up for it. \n\nThe alternative is making a company for yourself which is risky and takes a lot of money, or it's foraging around in the woods which would be awful. Working for someone else is an amazing opportunity which is why so many people do it. Don't mistake something being awesome for people being forced to partake in it."

"It's important to understand what is being measured there though. You are not measuring divorce rate in terms of what fraction of married people are getting divorced. You are measuring what fraction of divorces are happening per capita of all people, those who got married and those who did not get married. Obviously, being hidden in the statistics increasingly large group of unmarried people does not inherently make any given married couple less likely to divorce. \n\nI think a lot of people would tend to consider the \"divorce rate\" to be a measurement of how likely divorce is as an outcome to a marriage. And if you do that, you see that the inflow of divorces to the statistics relative to the inflow of marriages to the statistics is steadily increasing. There are more divorces per marriage taking place in 2006 than in 2000, and more divorces per marriage taking place in 2011 than in 2006 or 2000. \n\nAdmittedly, simply measuring marriages in 2011 (where the outcomes will not be known for decades) to divorces in 2011 (where many of the marriages began prior to 2011) is not a good measurement, but I feel like it more accurately encapsulates what people think of when they think of \"Divorce rate\". The rate of divorces in the abscence of marriage will obviously by definition be zero. \n\nI am afraid I am not really willing to comment on your first source, because the primary source listed in the references of that blog post is a dead link, and I am not really comfortable getting my statistics off of the blog of a political cartoonist without the ability to independently verify them.

The older people tried to make the younger ones feel guilty about wanting to leave, even though it was to make a better future for themselves. It's hard to break a cycle like that."
"Ok, tell us exactly how you do give a shit, and what you think should be done about poverty?

"I've listened to Bernie with Tom Hartmann for years, so I'm pretty up-to-date on his general position, but I went ahead and read the article to see where I failed you so badly.  After reading it, I realized that it said exactly what I've heard him so many, many times.\n\nIn my response that you quoted, I was specifically addressing Alpha's comment, \"I wonder how it is across the sea in like Germany or France about their government....\"  My \"deep thinking\" was stating that most modern Western nations, especially those that we're competing with, are Parliamentary democracies in one form or another.  India probably has one of the most complex electoral processes in the world (thousands of parties are possible), but they're not particularly Western (though we do compete with them in some areas).\n\nThe beauty of parliamentary elections is that people could vote for a party (not just third parties, but fourth, fifth, fifteenth, or four-hundreth parties!), and as long as they got 1/435th of the national vote (or .23%, also equivalent to 414,588 votes if tallying registered voters, or 298,369 votes if tallying actual 2012 voters), then that party would get at least one seat in the House of Representatives.  Each party could hold national primaries to rank their priority of seat holders, so once the number of seats were determined for each national party, then that number of representatives would be selected from the priority list.\n\nIn this case, even the smallest, most fringe group could potentially get a candidate elected to a seat, if they could get just under 300k votes nationally.  Now, once that seat was filled, it would be up to the representative to build and participate in coalitions with other parties to ensure that their agenda was reflected in the legislative process.\n\nAny outside groups that want to steamroll legislation would either have to outspend 51% of all seats in the House on a national scale, which would amount to controlling 65 million votes/voters who completely embrace ALL of their ideological positions, or they would have to compromise with other parties to get a 51% majority stake coalition built.\n\nTHAT system has a lot more opportunity for all of the diversity in America to be represented than the current system.  As it currently stands, they are able to gerrymander a majority of districts to make it where it isn't even a fight to win, and then spend smaller pots of money in just a few districts to make up the difference for the majority between two parties.\n\nIf you think the current system is \"representative\" as a democracy, you are either part of the 1% or deluded.\n\nAlso, I love Bernie, and am a Democratic Socialist myself.  I'd love to see us move to a Parliamentary system because I feel our current Republic is failing the majority of citizens, and when the government can't fulfill its duties to a majority of its people, it's time for a change.  Alas, it won't happen in my lifetime."
"No, my life goal is to make 30k a year, which would be enough for my husband and I to support a small family where I live. The entire notion of raising minimum wage that high is utterly ridiculous. The idea behind mw is to give entry level jobs to people with no marketable skills. Mw jobs were never meant to support families, and by the same stroke, NO ONE, in my state at least, should make $15/hour for a job that requires no skills. I fully understand that in order to land a gig that would pay that kind of money, I would have to aquire a skill set that is WORTH that kind of money."
"Ah, so where to begin...\n\nI am pretty sure I am allowed to interpret how little you know based on your comments. And based on the crap you have posted here, you don't know shit.\n\nConversely, I worked for \"big corporations\" for more than a decade before I started my own company - so I may have seen a lot more than you can even pretend to.\n\nBut this masterful gaff take the fucking cake.\n\n&gt; \"Full unemployment is unacceptable?\"\n\nI never said that.

"Exactly. College makes thinkers, not workers with some in-demand skill set. That is why we need something to make workers with some in-demand skill set. That is all a lot of people want, and/or all a lot of people will ever need. It doesn't make you an idiot if that's what you want to do. In Europe they have trade schools with apprenticeship programs for things like running electrical systems as complicated as an entire metropolitan network of stop lights, that is programming, electrical work, etc.\n\nI went to college, I understand what it had done for me. However I do remember in undergrad for every 10 people there, something like 5 of them really didn't belong there. They were there because they were pressured to go by society/parents/high-school and told that's what get's them a good career, but they weren't actually interested in learning what is taught there."

"I get that US police standards actively discourage intelligent applicants, but the word you're looking for is \"impair\".  You're still arguing for, \"equip everybody possible for everything possible where possible\", but risk management involves measuring cost and side effects.  Poorly trained civilian government employees, such as police, interact with and require the trust of the public, pretending you're in the military raises barriers to interaction and lowers trust.  As I've said in other threads, if a US resident sees a cop in need, the best thing to do is stay away because you have no idea how his poorly trained associates will respond.  It's better to let a cop bleed out to protect yourself, because US police are poorly trained and over-equipped."

For example, when the auto industry suffered huge problems a few years ago, the incredibly generous salaries and pensions afforded to many American auto workers were simply unsustainable (and arguably should never have been agreed to to begin with). The companies could literally fail without renegotiating those contracts and unions made that extremely difficult. The teachers' union is a common reference for the last point, where certifiably bad teachers would e.g. be [sent to rooms where they did nothing for literally years because they weren't fit to teach but couldn't be fired.](http://nypost.com/2012/01/29/disgraced-teacher-is-worth-10m-makes-100000-a-year-does-nothing-refuses-to-leave/)\n\nKeep in mind I'm attempting to give the OP a reasonable answer to his question, so please don't respond berating me personally."

"A tremendous difference between the economy of the past 40 years and, say, the 25 years preceeding it (roughly 1945 - 1971) is that the economy has become much more volatile and much more _randomly_ volatile.  Even if incomes were reduced, if they could be _predictable_ people and families could cope far better.  A huge trend of the past 20, and especially the past 10 years has been the tremendous short-term variability in incomes.  Families, households, and individual simply cannot make long-term plans.\n\nSeveral economists ([Jeff Ruben notably](https://www.readability.com/articles/btobdd00)) have made the association that all but one of the post WWII recessions have been preceded by a spike in oil prices.  I've graphed the [relationship between the changes in oil prices (West Texas Intermediate Crude) and GDP](http://i.imgur.com/hfBRw9f.png) using the Federal Reserve's \"FRED\" data analysis site.\n\nNotably:\n\n* GDP data are annual.  I've set the oil price data to quarterly to capture short-term fluctuations otherwise not visible.\n* Note that prior to 1974, WTI tracked a _very_ predictable 2.5% price trend.  This was the period during which [the TRC, Texas Railroad Commission, effectively set the price for oil through extraction (production) quotas](http://www.phil.frb.org/research-and-data/publications/business-review/2007/q1/br_q1-2007-3_oil-shocks.pdf) (see footnote p. 1).  In March of 1971, the TRC lifted those quotas, effectively removing any limits on extraction rates.  US oil extraction had peaked.\n* The _very_ modest deviations in price prior to 1974, in 1949, 1954, 1958, and 1970, were associated with recessions.  There's another recession in 1962 which doesn't seem to have an associated oil-related trigger.\n* During the same period, economic performance as measured by GDP is uneven, but highly regular.  I believe this is the period during which the concept of an economic cycle, tied tightly to the Presidential election cycle, was formulated.  I believe that was an erroneous (or at best partial) association.\n* 1971 is the watershed.  Oil prices never resume their previous level of stability, and GDP cycles become more random and volatile.\n* 1974 is when the shit really hits the fan with the Arab Oil Embargo.  Surprisingly, though there's a recession, the GDP hit isn't relatively modest, but once again, the previous strongly regular pattern in GPD rises and declines has been lost.\n* 1979 sees a repeat with the Iran Hostage Crisis, and the double-dip recessions of 1980-1982, much more severe than 1974 in terms of GDP decline.\n* Note 1987.  Though there's no officially-declared recession, GDP takes a big hit as oil prices spike.  In October of 1987 the DJIA dropped by, as memory serves, 25% in a single day.  I see this as a prelude to the eventual financial instabilities of the late 1990s and 2000s.\n* 1991 sees the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq and the first Gulf War.  Oil prices spike and there's a recession.  Note that the long-term GDP growth trend has fallen from about 7.5% 1950-1970 to about 5% following 1990.\n* Prior to the 2000 recession is a huge spike in oil prices, to 10% (annually? quarterly?).  GDP falls to its lowest levels since the 1961 recession.  It's the dot-com bust.\n* Both GDP and oil prices recover until 2008 where there's yet another spike and fall in GDP.  The \"recovery\" eventually settles to a roughly 4% annual growth rate, just over half that of the 1950-1970 period.\n\nMore on this and some discussion in this reddit post:  [FRED: WTI vs. GDP, percent change](http://www.reddit.com/r/dredmorbius/comments/1tz6y2/fred_wti_vs_gdp_percent_change/)."

"&gt; Your arrogance is matched only by your ignorance.\n\nI think you've described yourself pretty well there.\n\n&gt; \"Hi, force doesn't exist. Gravity is an intrinsic property of space. General Relativity 101.\"\n\n&gt; Two objects exert a force of attraction on one another known as \"gravity.\" Even as the center of the Earth is pulling you toward it (keeping you firmly lodged on the ground), your center of mass is pulling back at the Earth, albeit with much less force. Sir Isaac Newton quantified the gravity between two objects when he formulated his three laws of motion. Yet Newton's laws assume that gravity is an innate force of an object that can act over a distance.\n\n&gt; Albert Einstein, in his theory of special relativity, determined that the laws of physics are the same for all non-accelerating observers, and he showed that the speed of light within a vacuum is the same no matter the speed at which an observer travels. As a result, he found that space and time were interwoven into a single continuum known as space-time. Events that occur at the same time for one observer could occur at different times for another.\n\n&gt; As he worked out the equations for his general theory of relativity, Einstein realized that massive objects caused a distortion in space-time. Imagine setting a large body in the center of a trampoline. The body would press down into the fabric, causing it to dimple. A marble rolled around the edge would spiral inward toward the body, pulled in much the same way that the gravity of a planet pulls at rocks in space.\n\nhttp://www.space.com/17661-theory-general-relativity.html\n\nYes, its not the same as \"forces\" its about the intrinsic properties of the geometry of space.\n\nYou're calling me ignorant while attempting to use Newtonian mechanics on relativistic problems?\n\n&gt; Surface area is not determined by mass, and drag is determined more by aerodynamics than by surface area. If that was not the case, we'd be launching spheres instead of rockets (smallest surface area per unit volume).\n\nDesign is determined by the requirements. If the ship does not have to exit the atmosphere, it can have a much larger area. It can also have much larger cross sections and be designed for the specific purpose of space flight, and not having to satisfy multiple requirements.\n\n&gt; Launching a given mass into orbit from Earth will require a certain amount of energy, boosting it from Earth orbit to the moon (drag is irrelevant here) will require more.\n\nThis is false. Launching it from orbit takes the most energy because once you reach escape velocity, your momentum can carry you forward. Space doesn't slow you down, you're right there is no drag. That doesn't make it the hardest part of the trip. Since it doesn't take energy to change your momentum, your resistance to change is also easier.\n\nThe absolute hardest part in that short time span is getting into space. Moving at a speed that's fast enough to get somewhere besides the moon is another complication that the Alcubierre drive will hopefully solve, but that cannot be tested on earth.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcubierre_drive\n\n&gt; Accelerating a given mass to escape velocity requires a certain minimum amount of force, and that doesn't change by breaking up the payload into smaller pieces.\n\nYes, it does. You're ignoring how gravity works and air drag. The big marble rolls harder down the bowl and makes it more difficult.\n\nThere is no hand waving here, its called the gamma factor:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_factor\n\n&gt; Your handwaving doesn't alter physics.\n\nChanging the allowable area does.\n\nWhy didn't we just shoot MIR up as one big piece? Why did we assemble it in space?"

"I am suggesting nothing of the sort.  If a company as profitable as McDonalds or Walmart raises their lowest wage by fifty cents, it will still be profitable.

This is a detestable lie; companies that CHOOSE to fire these workers rather than pay out a reasonable, livable wage are contemptuous and should be treated as such.  While providing a living wage will obviously make a dent in corporate profits, it is CERTAINLY affordable for the  vast majority of corporations.  \n\nExcuse my hostility, but suggesting that advocating a livable wage is FORCING companies to fire employees is completely disingenuous.  Raising worker wages is obviously against a company's best interests (which is exactly why we have to do it in the first place), but it seems rather obvious that many of the larger American corporations can simultaneously provide a livable wage and produce reasonable profits.  \n\nEdit: I also notice you failed to respond to my remark regarding \"slave\" labor and your definition of fairness.

I had heard about Teacher unions in places like Washington DC keeping teachers on despite them literally sitting in a classroom all day with other teachers doing nothing, but to me this sounded like an extreme. So a follow question I have would be how does one maintain the many benefits a union provides while limiting the negative consequences? And if the two are too interwoven how do you go about judging the worth of the organization and if it overall beneficial or if it should be abolished? All of this was left out in my simple explanation of free market good, unionized labor force bad. "

"*\"This evening I let my emotions get the best of me when listening to the President's remarks regarding the coverage of illegal immigrants in the health care bill. While I disagree with the President's statement, my comments were inappropriate and regrettable. I extend sincere apologies to the President for this lack of civility.\"* -Joe Wilson, apology for his outburst.\n\nIt was during a healthcare speech, when Obama said the legislation would not mandate coverage for undocumented immigrants, which was  [debunked](http://www.factcheck.org/2009/08/seven-falsehoods-about-health-care/). It literally had nothing to do with the NSA or anything else. So, at the time when idiot Wilson spoke, yes, he was a fool who was proven wrong.\n\n Once again, stupid people are so ready to hate Obama because that is what they are being manipulated into doing, that they are grasping at any kind of straw they can and connecting dots that don't connect just to prove themselves right. Joe Wilson was wrong about the healthcare, and he is still wrong and completely irrelevant to what is going on today. \n\nAlso, calling a politician a liar is not some brilliant insight. Every single politician lies, and so does every person on the planet. It is part of politics and leadership. The difference is people like you will hate Obama no matter what, and are just looking for any reason to justify it. A level-headed person, Rep or Dem, Lib or Con, will look at the whole picture and wait to make judgment until all the facts are clear and whether this particular \"lie\" was justified.\n\nOf course, I don't know why I'm wasting my time on a wingnut. You don't understand logic, you will not use reasoning, and no matter what I say, you will go crawling back to your safety net bubble of fear and anger where you get all your misinformation until you forget the facts and can readily get back to your happy hate.\n\nGood day to you, sir"
"Lobbying will never go away. Our representatives aren't experts on everything so they rely heavily off the expertise of interest groups. Furthermore, you wouldn't want to lose the ability to influence your representatives which is really lobbying on a smaller scale. \n\nHowever, you are so fucking right on that campaign donations should be illegal. There should be a small amount of campaign money through public funds towards the parties and that is it. They don't need flashy gatherings and private diners that cost $1,000/plate. You get rid of the campaign donations and you get rid of the incentive for lobbyists to hold favors over our representatives. "

"Here's a link to [their site.](http://www.gop.gov/indepth/pledge/healthcare). \n\nKeep in mind that their focus is first on repealing the existing law because it simply isn't working. Their argument is that we need to start over. You may disagree with that but [polls show](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/obama_and_democrats_health_care_plan-1130.html) that the law is increasingly unpopular. It's expensive, it's killing jobs, it adds to our deficit, no one fully understands the law, and the president has been tweaking the original law over the years in order to keep it moving forward. The problem is that we will most likely begin to hear stories of poor people who are buying expensive health insurance that doesn't cover what they need it to cover. Meaning poor people will end up spending more money than they were led to believe they would spend. That's what republicans are trying to avoid. So we are  throwing people into a Medicaid system that is going broke, and people are buying into a system that hasn't proven to be the best solution. But they have insurance so it's a good deal?\n\nAlso, you hear this law being compared to what Romney did in Massachussets. But it's different in that Romney balanced the budget in his state, they have a consistently low unemployment rate, and they spent a lot of time ensuring that both sides of the aisle would vote for the law. The affordable care act hasn't shown to be popular except among those who voted for it, it's adding taxes, and hurting jobs."

"Prime rate has historically been around the midhigh single digits. \n\nLow interest rate does several things. Obviously it encourages spending. The flip side is that because of that more people have access to money and thus for large purchases like houses the prices rise. This rise is price causes larger loans and longer in debt. \n\nThis low interest rate can also drastically increase a default risk. If someone goes to a mortgage that is 40% of their gross income at a 3% interest rate. If the rate goes up to 6% that person can be easily hooped. Meaning bankruptcy, destroyed credit and more hardship later on for someone to access credit. There is a reason nations increase their prime interest rate. \n\nThe workforce did not double overnight.

"&gt; Now price that same thing in 1969. Tell someone you are going to get 4 personal lines to your house each month.\n\nAccording to [this document](http://transition.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Common_Carrier/Reports/FCC-State_Link/IAD/ref97.pdf) it would be $5.61 per line in 1968$, which is equal to $37.57 in 2013$. Oddly enough, this is pretty similar to the cost of a landline phone these days, perhaps now you gain in free local calls, but often you'll have to pay per minute still for long distance or buy a long distance bundle which will likely double your bill.\n\nAlso unlimited calling plans are really a recent invention, hitting landlines in the early 2000s and mobile phones in the late 2000s. It's certainly easy to understand that mobile phones in the 90s were luxury items, and not price competitive with landline phone service. Landline phone service was still very expensive in the 90s. Much of the telecommunications industry has actually been plagued by a failure to offer pricing that falls in line with cost of service and technological advancement. One could argue that purchasing power on telecommunications should be even higher than it is now, but thanks to embedded interests has stagnated. They are offering more, but you're not necessarily able to pay less for the same.\n\nThe point about internet access (and also phone service) is that the minimum cost of entry has actually stayed the same or increased over time. While certain areas of the telecommunications sector have seen major savings for heavy users, light or moderate users, or users trying to go ala carte have not been reaping as many benefits.\n\nI think it's hard to try to excuse lower wages through potential increases in purchasing power. Some people may opt to go without these products, or may not actually be receiving increased purchasing power based on their usage criteria. Additionally for certain goods, lower or stagnant purchasing power may actually be due to illegal labor practices in the US and abroad(e.g. agriculture, tech). I am not sure that should be promoted as a positive."

The government will be heavily involved in any system that doesn't result in people unable to afford care dying and the republican party has made it clear that they are opposed to that happening. There is no free market solution to giving handouts to everyone in need and when they are dying that is something that needs to happen.

If you're one of the less well to do you might have to get by with the $50 to $80 a month insurance that covers the absolute bare minimum--after you pay out of pocket up front for your deductible, of course."

This simple, unassailable finding implies that policy makers can extend unemployment benefits to provide assistance to those out of work without substantially increasing unemployment rates. \"\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/21/opinion/yes-economics-is-a-science.html?pagewanted=2&amp;pagewanted=all\n\nEssentially, the data simply does not support the right wing talking point that unemployment insurance is creating a nation of lazy moochers.  However, the data does support that ending unemployment insurance is cutting of a life line for this people, causing unnecessary immiseration. "
"You miss the point.\n\nANY capitalism is too much capitalism, and will ALWAYS inevitably give rise to the problems we are now facing today.  \"Reforms\" only temporarily ameliorate immediate conditions, and guarantee that future generations will suffer as much if not worse when these reforms are taken apart piece by piece (as has occurred).  In the meantime, we are facing a world in which there is decreasing opportunity for human beings born in recent years - directly caused by that economic system (resource depletion, ecological destruction, climate change [which will exacerbate all the other problems] and much, much more!).  They have nothing to look forward to at this rate,  unless they're the sadomasochist types.  There is no future for these people who are born to be permanent **renters**, paying what amounts to forced tithes to the owning class, whose only claim to this lopsided relationship was being born at the right time from the right vagina.\n\nCapitalism is undemocratic and anti-meritocratic.  It is hierarchical, authoritarian, and regressive.  If a government, any government, is beholden to a system where **money is power**, then that government too will eventually, even with the best of intentions, come to reflect the same exact thing.  And that's exactly what we have today - a government that is beholden to moneyed interests; not to the voice of the people, and certainly not to voices of reason or rationality.  And that means that unless you have money, your vote really does not count.  Continuing this charade and acting as if capitalism is fixable will only further doom future generations to suffer just as billions today do."

"I doubt cost of living is that much higher, especially not if you take into account all of the benefits you receive here.

North of Copenhagen, and I live comfortably on that budget, and I often have $200 left at the end of the month, even if I go out a couple of times a month.\n\nIf you make $90k/year, often you'll make more right out of school, if you had student jobs during your studies, and you get hired at that company. You'll have about $55-56k left after taxes.\n\nThen you also have to think about, that education is free, and you get paid while studying, free universal health care, 6-8 weeks of vacation time, great unemployment benefits, paid parental leave, low crime rate, not big barriers in social classes etc."

In Denmark, even if you don't take a college education, you can get well paying jobs, and all full time jobs give livable wages, and if you're unemployed you can comfortably live off unemployment benefits. That salary mentioned is also just a starting salary.\n\nI just appreciate, that paying taxes means that people won't go hungry to bed, and that it keeps crime rates low, and it erases social classes. I benefited from that system, and I want to contribute to that as well, so other can have it as easy as I had it. I wouldn't be happy living in a country with a lot of crime, huge emphasis on social classes and social heritage, high income inequality, people working day and night for something not even close to livable wages, almost no vacation days, no parental leave, very basic benefits if you go broke etc.\n\nWe can all find reasons why we would prefer a place over another, and that's probably why you live in the US and I live in Denmark.

You can argue that it's still a good idea with it, and that's fine, but if you argue that doesn't happen you are as bad as global warming denialists.\n\nWhy is that so impt you say? This disincentive is impt because it forces the wage up. By itself this isn't a bad thing, but the higher wages mean employers will also hire less leading to, you guessed it, less jobs available. So when people say they will decrease unemployment benefits when more jobs become available, they are implicitly saying the two are independent. They aren't, unemployment benefits have the potential to decrease available jobs. \n\nAnd again, if you want to argue that effect is small or something, that's fine.

A simple explanation is that you have to show that you are or will be directly harmed.

As the judge noted if the main plaintiff had been arrested or suffered some other injury because of this then he would have standing. Saying he might possibly be searched in the future isn't good enough. \n\nThe judges writing about the merits of the case aren't all the surprising either.

"I'm with you on the Libertarian bullshit.  Most of what is on Reddit in that regard are teen-agers with no real-world experience, hence they parrot the most ridiculous positions.\n\nThe \"easy money\" is a good example.  Easy money is a by-product of loose regulations (that's what accounted for the low rates that started around 1998) followed by the liquidity trap that we are still in.  It's an effect, not a cause, but Libertarians aren't that good at looking at sequences of events and acknowledging that causality may flow in a  direction opposite of their theory.\n\nThe important thing is realizing that understanding the drivers of the long-term trends and the differences between advertized and real rates is more important than just looking at the headline.  Yes, headline mortgage rates are low today, but the underwriting is much tighter, and fewer people get approved for that headline rate today even though their income meets criteria -- banks have just gotten tighter because they have too many non-performing loans on their books.  That's true for both mortgages and small business lending, especially small business lending where the underwriting was very loose in the early 2000's, and where a lot of banks pretty much got out of small business lending in 2009.\n\nAnyone, you or a libertarian, who things those government sponsored loans are easy money should go apply for an SBA loan and see just how difficult it is to get a business loan.  That's why I say, as  sincere advice, if you want to start a business in the future the best way to fund your small business start-up is to keep your personal finances very clean, then apply for one small business credit card about a year before you open the businesss -- apply when you are in business planning mode.  If you get a great credit limit, say $20,000, then start using that card sparingly, paying the balance every month, and about a year later apply for 2 or 3 more cards in the same week.  At least 1 or 2 will be approved with attractive credit limits, and there you are, you've got a good line of credit for starting your business, probably at an aggregate 15% interest rate with reward features but maybe with a short term teaser rate.  \n\nIf you walk into the bank you are currently using for your personal accounts and ask for a $50,000 small business line of credit they will turn you down unless you've been in business with positive cash flow for at least a year, and you won't see an interest rate below 10% unless you pledge collateral.  It's just the way it is, banks got burned due to their own mistakes in 2009 and they're now very tight on business lending."

"This is the main problem we're facing right now is that despite the methodology and required infrastructure among developed countries being capable of fixing their issues with public discomfort most of the upper class of those countries spend much of their money on keeping things the same.  Don't believe me?  Here's an example:\n\nAfghanistan is currently the largest holder of lithium on earth.  Roughly 50% of the worlds lithium is in Afghanistan.  The United States invaded Afghanistan in 2001 under the guise of terrorism and now argues simply that it allows us to keep American interests afloat.  Up until then what technologies were currently available that used lithium?  The iPhone came out in 2007 and the Roadster came out in 2008.  Before this most batteries were pretty much only available as lead-acid based systems that did not work nearly as well.\n\nIf my self found correlation is wrong please someone crucify me in the comments below however I've noticed that this sort of information does not seem to make itself easily available to U.S. citizenry and probably will not until people start learning not what information to memorize but what questions deserve the time to seek an answer.\n\nCountries with higher levels of supposed freedom have seemingly coincidentally been around much longer as a civil entity.  I am of the belief that it is simply a matter of the evolution of democracy as we see what methodology in governmental structure fails and which don't.  However I also believe this can be catalyzed by understanding of history.  Which once again leads us to the issue of asking the right questions and seeking to fix a problem on a grander scale than simply those of the individual as this is the current structure of most peoples lives.\n\nSo yes to some degree technology can help evolve humanity out of the allegorical rat race however it can also just as easily cause us to lose empathy and focus only on our individual interpretation.  It is a matter of figuring out what data can effect the populous in the most effective manner to bring about their engagement in the cause of greater good."

It appears that somehow this program was making positive changes in the lives of the people it touches.\n\nOr maybe it's only those people undergoing drug tests for the jobs they hold who actually use those recreational drugs.  But that would make even less sense.  The drug tests would catch them, they wouldn't get jobs, and they would become those unemployable people on welfare who you claim don't use recreational drugs.

Unless you plan to stay in this role for the rest of your career or move up inside this company then consider what you do above and beyond your original role as \"self-training\". You are NOT worth more to the company because you took it upon yourself to do something that they did not ask you to do. \nHowever it WILL help you in the long run due to the experience you gain doing these tasks.\n\nAlso - This is very important!\nCompanies are blind - Do not blame the company if you are getting nowhere by performing well. This issue is either with YOUR Manager, HIS Manager or YOU;\n\na) Either YOUR Manager is not taking note and making any effort to promote what you have done for the department.\n\nb) He has done so but been given no options for you by HIS Manager therefore effectively tying his hands.\n \nc) *You think you are more valuable than you are* (this happens a LOT) - Know that you can be replaced with only very minimal harm unless your role has a literal effect on the company value (share prices drop when you leave etc - C-Level execs)\n\nIf it is a or b - then you are really out of luck, these guys are going nowhere unless they screw up big time, and their Directors etc really dont care about you, so going dirently to them will do nothing - either move on or stay and accept your situation.\n\nWith C you can change it for yourself; \nDO what you are asked to do - and do it well.\nDONT do things you are not asked to do unless you have nothing left to do on the list of things you were asked to do. even then do NOT expect reward from it.\n\nSometimes however - the only way to go up is to move sideways."

Not totally dissimilar from CS but I still managed to work my way over by learning stuff on my own.\n\nEDIT : I will say the math education helped me work my way over for sure, but my point is there are people with a specialized degree in CS that can't even get employed in CS.

"it's not pointless--do you realize silver and gold are defined as the only forms of money in the constitution? that's because both are an excellent store of value and have been valued by mankind for 1000s of years.\n\ntoday, the value of a silver quarter can buy a gallon of gas. in 1950, a silver quarter could also buy a gallon of gas. the only difference is the hard money used today has no value except for the arbitrary value given to it by the government, whereas the money used in the past had real value and could be held by people and the actual value would not decrease over time. in other words, if you had 100 quarters in 1950, you could either buy 100 gallons of gas, or hold onto them until day where you could still purchase 100 gallons of gas (converting the silver into FRNs first) you could buy 100 gallons of gas. the wealth you possess doesn't change over time. holding onto fiat money and unsound currency only hurts you because there is nothing of value backing it, and what you're able to purchase goes down over time. \n\nwhen the dollar went of the gold standard, nothing backed the dollar anymore and the government was allowed to inflate away its debt. any savings were \"taxed\" by inflation.

There is also an increased cancer incidence and mortality rate, especially in women, compared with western countries. Studies suggest that high omega-6 linoleic acid consumption might aggravate HI and IR, in addition to being a substrate for lipid peroxidation and free radical formation. Thus, rather than being beneficial, high omega-6 PUFA diets may have some long-term side effects, within the cluster of hyperinsulinemia, atherosclerosis and tumorigenesis.\n\n&gt; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8960090\n\nThe idea that a food (saturated fat) that humans have eaten in large quantities for the last 2 million years are not well adapted to (and thus it makes us sick), but the idea that grains, which we've only been eating in appreciable quantities for 10,000 years, or better yet the 100 years of vegetable oil and refined sugar, we are more adapted to is laughable.\n\nThe most nutritious foods on the planet are organ meats (e.g. liver, heart, kidney, and pancreas, thyroid, spleen, brain, etc.) and yet nutritionists tell us to avoid them due to this scary thing called cholesterol.  http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/beef-products/3469/2\n\nFunny thing that even 25 eggs/day for 15 years isn't enough and 88 year old's cholesterol.  http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199103283241306\n\nYou can choose to exercise, or you can choose to not exercise, but you should know that it's good for you.

Are you trying to insult them?  They nor I can be insulted.  \n\nSince you make me laugh so much at your own arrogant ignorance, I'll just explain what I did to you and why.  \n\nI normally wouldn't care about your ridiculous beliefs and inane syntax at expressing those beliefs.  When I see something on reddit so fantastically stupid it makes my nose bleed, I just leave it alone.  You're entitled to your own ignorance.\n\nBut no one is entitled to their arrogance.  You were having a pleasant disagreement with someone on reddit.  When you started to lose the argument you decided to become a piece of shit dickhead. \n\nThat's where I come in.  I decided to jump into your little debate and have some fun.  But how to make Gonzzzo reply to me??\n\nThere are several ways to get someone to reply to you on the internet.  I won't go into all of them here, but after a quick review of your prior posts, it became clear to me that you're a narcissist with borderline personality disorder. \n\nThis meant that the best approach for you was what I call \"indirect appeasement scenario\".  It's culled from decades of psychological research (not my own) but it's best explained thusly. \n\nTo guarantee a response from you I need to do two things.  1.)  Insult your ego and 2.) for me to appear to be cowardly and inferior in doing so.   The first is obvious, not only did I insult you, but I insulted something you love almost as much as yourself; MSNBC.  This isn't anything new.  I'm sure this happens a lot to you actually.\n\nTo achieve the second objective, I had to appear both cowardly and intellectually inferior to you.  To do this, I replied to the post where you became a jackass piece of shit, pretending to be replying to someone else. \n\nIn your mind, not only was I too afraid to reply to you, but that I was also so incompetent as to reply to the wrong person.  You automatically thought me a coward and an idiot. \n\nIt actually worked better than I'd hoped.  Not only did I convince you that I was a coward and an idiot, you actually convinced yourself that I'd deleted my previous posts when I clearly hadn't.  You bought the image that I sold you and truly believed that I was an inferior piece of meat that you could dominate.\n\nThat's how I made you reply to me.  The rest is just pleasantry.  I continue to expose your ignorance and you keep flying further and further off the handle. \n\nThat fact that you keep replying for more abuse indicates to me that you might be a bit of a masochist as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

"It was, Obama didn't create it, he revised it.  This is a reworked version of a Republican plan dating from the days of Nixon and used a few years back by Romney.  A few years back when the Ds pushed single-payor for a while, an earlier version of this plan was the Rs' response.  Obama supposedly chose this bill instead of single-payor to show he was bi-partisan, willing to cross the aisle to get something done.\n\nStill, the reactions of Republicans to the exchanges blows all their talk of a \"free market\" out of the water.  What?  You don't want people to be able to compare plans side by side and choose the best one?\n\nUltimately, the solution probably is something like the credit-union-ish run by-members for-members insurance company in New York state that got discussed here a while back.

If we wish to treat it as something other than that, then we need to accept that free market capitalism needs to be overridden by other principals that recognize that business owners have a duty to the public that extends beyond their bottom line.

Let's say that a worker making $30k/yr has bought $20k of stock in the WeSaySo corporation.  The workers there just went on strike and demand higher pay and benefits, because they had been relying on government programs to help make ends meet.  The worker is faced with a dilemma, support his fellow workers goal to gain higher wages or support the WeSaySo corporation to maintain a higher stock price for his $20k investment?  Those wages won't directly affect him, but perhaps indirectly in the long run as other companies also raise their wages to compete.  \n\nThis shows the inherent conflict of interest between the owners of capital and the laborers, their incomes do compete despite all of the facile rhetoric about inequality not affecting reality.  Usually one's interests fall mostly inside one camp or the other and the choice is not vacillated.  Of course, the choice would be justified in the most perceivably justifiable way after the fact.  *Those workers should have gotten a better education or should just leave if they want higher pay.*  Most people will defend their source of income, no matter how self-serving at the expense of others it may be."

"You're in luck, since Michigan just recently got approval for their Medicaid expansion, which will go into effect on April 1, 2014. So while you won't be eligible as of today like many states have allowed, you'll still get Medicaid in the end.\n\nThat will also exempt you from the penalty, since the start date will fall at the same time as the deadline for the tax penalty (which, by the way, can't result in criminal or civil penalties either).

"I blame the fight between the ying yang states. "
"It is very important actually.  The wealthy need ignoramuses like the politically religious to vote for their operatives so that the operatives can give the rich owning class low taxes, deregulation, subsidies and other favorable legislation.  Issues like abortion and gay marriage get people to vote for those representatives of the rich without thinking twice about it.  \n\nThe nightmare for this group of self-interested rich people is an informed, engaged, populace that understands and focuses its own economic interests.  It is the harbinger of reduced economic inequality, which would decrease the proportion of the wealth (created by the *labor* of human beings) that the wealthy control.  \n\nThe interests of the working class and the owner class have conflicted since the first man hired others to tend his land for a portion of the food.  It exists because giving workers less of the produce yields more produce for the owner.  Slavery was an extreme of worker efficiency for the owning class.  The large manors on the plantations in the south are culturally celebrated relics of the times of when the work of many men propped up owners to high levels of material prosperity.  Class conflict doesn't cease when rich people get offended, but the rich can often get ignorant working class people to unilaterally disarm by doing so."
"I feel you. Currently looking at the insurance plans and given how my mom recently quit her job for various reasons and I'm unemployed at the moment, the subsidy doesn't apply for us and Medicare in Texas wasn't expanded either. So it's either pay the full amount for a plan with an already high deductible like you mentioned or not get insurance and pay that stupid fine.\n\nI don't think it's the plans fault so much as Texas refusing to expand Medicare to cover those who wouldn't afford the subsidies. I'm glad Rick Perry will be leaving office and hopefully someone with a bit more sense in their brain is elected. "
"That data is based on W2's, which is on a per employer basis, not household income.  So if you have multiple part time jobs, or switch jobs in the middle of the year, or even two spouses who both work then you would have more than one W2 attached to a single household.  Still, it's not that far off I bet, but It is definitely skewed by being based on W2s."

"The whole purpose of health insurance is to mitigate the cost of unexpected injury or disease. How the hell is routine, monthly birth control something that needs to be insured against?

Paying for contraceptives through insurance just passes the cost back to consumers.\n\nPharmaceutical companies get to charge large markups for contraception because so many people already have it covered by insurance and don't pay the full price, so they raise the price and market designer contraceptives (Yaz) to capture the subsidy. If anything, banning contraceptives from being covered would be more effective at lowering the price, because covering them under insurance means the pharmaceitical company gets to jack up the price because no one is conserned about hte price at the point of sale and the insurance company doesn't care because they just pass the cost back to the consumer.\n\nOr better yet, if you really want to make contraception cheap, instead of passing a law mandating health insurance cover it (which will just be passed back to the consumer in the form of a higher insurance bill), pass one making it over-the-counter.\n\nHaving insurance companies cover contraceptives, a routine health cost, works out to be just another hand out to the medical sector.

"this is not how economics works. at. all. and it's the same pseudo-economic garbage that is used to feed the masses trickle down economics.\n\nwhen you add more workers, it should in turn create more wealth, which it clearly has done. we've also got much more efficient at creating wealth as we've continued to automate things.  as [thevardanian](http://www.reddit.com/user/thevardanian) points out [further down the thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1u3f8p/in_1969_the_median_salary_for_a_male_worker_was/cee75xr), the GDP per capita in 1969 was $32,500, and it is now $51,948. \n\nso you see, we've actually added a ton of wealth, per every person. but that wealth is locked up with the wealthy. instead, the general populace is getting much poorer.\n\nthis is why people are now talking about guaranteed minimum income. because we actually _need_ to do _less_ work to make _more_ wealth. this is the magic of automation. it makes labor a leveragable commodity. 1 hour of labor no longer means 1 hour of production. 1 hour of labor now means 10+ labor hours because we've extended human ability through robots and computing.\n\nso yes the \"alarmist\" media - which by the way, rarely covers this sort of thing, _isn't_ skewing your perception on this front. \n\nand yes, a young person in london or paris has less opportunity. but you're pushing a logical fallacy. just because one thing is bad, doesn't mean another thing isn't bad also. in this case, they're both bad, relative to the opportunity that used to exist, and _should_ exist if we had a fair system. but we don't."

"Things like shelter and transportation are very hard to figure. People *choose* to live alone far more often today than they did in 1969. Marriage at an earlier age was more common at the same time women were joining the work force allowing for supplemental incomes for a family. Of course many of those marriages were misguided and ended in divorce. You would have to factor the economic impact of that as well. For transportation we have much higher efficiency &amp; safety standards. Yes your car costs more but it also doesn't easily kill you in an accident. It runs longer with less service. A car from the 1960s going more than 100k miles without major service was unheard of. Modern cars also cause considerably less pollution."

"&gt;No, there aren't bigger fish to fry and yes, it totally answered your question.\n\nMaking sure people who can't afford medication they need to live isn't bigger than people affording a $1 condom?  Is birth control really the crowning achievement of a health care overhaul?  If it is, its a failure of an overhaul.\n\nAs for the (not my) question, no it didnt answer, you're answer to why should cheap birth control be covered is that unexpected pregnancy complications can happen.  Those should be covered regardless of birth control so its irrelevant.  Should we cover all things that can be used to prevent any medical complication? Diet Soda to prevent Type 2 Diabetes?  \n\n&gt;Here's why there aren't bigger fish to fry: women refuse to allow the right wing to steal any more of our rights. \n\nWhen did I say you couldn't get birth control? Thats a strawman.  I just said we should focus on paying for life-saving/necessary drugs before we risk it all on birth control.\n\n&gt;It's huge because the right-wing has written and passed legislation that would leave women to die in ectopic pregnancies or complicated miscarriages. Georgia tried passing a bill that would prevent women from \"aborting\" dead fetuses even if it means they get sepsis and rot to death. Rep Terry England said that was fine because it happens to pigs and cows on his farm. \n\nHorrible legislation, also a strawman.  How is this an argument for free birth control being necessary? I completely agree those are god-awful arguments and should be discarded.  They're irrelevant to the topic at hand though.\n\n&gt;So yeah, sorry, its a big deal that you think its okay to steal from women because its not that much. \n\nNot giving free/covered birth control is stealing? How about not giving free/covered advil? Free/covered Athsma inhalers? All of which I can buy cheaply with no coverage (generics and such).\n\n&gt;I have religious objections to war. Do I get to sue the federal govt for using my taxes to fund Iraq? No. I don't. Because once I give away those taxes I get no more moral say over how they are spent than a vote. \n\nIrrelevant, I have no objection to birth control period. This doesn't refute my claim that its more expensive in lawsuits/costs to provide covered birth control, and the risk that health legislation comes crashing down due to it isn't worth it. \n\nI want you to have cheap birth control, good thing we have generics that are cheap even not covered. I support free birth control. I don't support putting bigger medical issues at risk to fund free birth control.\n\n&gt;So once a church pays its salaries, including the pharmaceutical plan. It has no more moral say or moral responsibility over how that pharmaceutical plan is used.\n\nUnless freedom of religion is interpreted to mean that the government can't force them to pay for medication they don't believe in. (Another shady door I wish wasn't cracked open by including it, we could've avoided this whole issue).\n\n&gt;If they want to each use their individual vote to try to vote in a right-wing politician to eliminate the need to provide health insurance, that's fine.\n\nAnd the birth control mandate stirs up people to want to shut it down. Better to avoid that at first and get the health care system working better before we open that can of worms.\n\nYou seem to think I'm an anti-birth control crusader, I'm not at all. I just personally think birth control shouldn't be addressed until the conditions that kill people are. Once the serious health issues are addressed then lets get it done. My priority is life &gt; birth control. It sucks that people run around using this as a wedge issue on healthcare, it really does. But that's the reality of it so lets work with what we have to start the process."

He constantly complains about not having money.  He, of all people, should be sympathetic to poor people.\n\nI've argued against this policy on multiple fronts.  The issue isn't one of money or drugs.  It's that most people need a reason to look down on others.  Rich people look down at the middle class, the middle class look down at the working poor.  The working poor look down at the non-working poor.  People don't want to realize how much easier it is to drop down a grade than it is to move up so they attack the people \"beneath\" them.

There needs to be a form of government or state in order to control distribution.  \n\nThat definition doesn't rationally make sense because it is unworkable.\n\nCommunist states in the past have been totalitarian in nature.  It is a natural end to the collection of power by the government.  Government takes power from the people, single group within the government takes power from the other groups, single leader takes power from the group and you have a dictator.  The quest for power doesn't end in a collective.  It will continually be consolidated.  History and human nature clearly show us this."

You just say, look grades are down, we must spend more money!  How has spending more in the last 40 years helped our test scores?  How much money are you willing to spend to increase grades?  Why are you unwilling to look at the gov't monopoly on education as the root cause of this wasteful spending?  Same applys to healthcare, inflation, \"income inequality\" ect.  Why are the charts the way they are?  because the gov't has a monopoly on a good or service, and can charge whatever they want.

"Oh hey bro. Thanks for making massive assumptions about my political leanings and sources.. You seem like a nice guy. Question: Is medicaid expansion going to cost states $0 the same way that the ACA \"won't add to our deficit\"? Please explain to me how this expansion is going to be free. Sure, the federal government will pick up the tab for the first handful of years but what happens after that? Also, did you know that the federal government is not offering the same reimbursement rate for people who were qualified for Medicaid but not enrolled before the ACA went into effect? Wonder how much that will cost in stated like Florida where loads of people will simply buy in to comply with the mandate, leaving their state with a big bill. Unlike the federal government, states have to balance their budget...They cant just print more money. That means if Medicaid expansions start eating up a massive amount of state's budgets (much like the federal budget now), states will have to find areas to cut or ways to make more money. And they can only make money through taxing the people. But if it makes you feel better to believe that it'll be free, I'll just dip on outta 'ere. "

Heading to the healthcare.gov site and looking at plans for Dallas County, TX with an annual income of $ 15,000 (too high for medicaid but would be covered under expanded medicaid if it were available in Texas) shows that the person is eligible for a $573/month tax credit.  \n  \nThat credit is enough to fully subsidize several different Bronze plans from several providers (both HMO and PPO options).  I understand there's a difference between Medicaid and Bronze plan; I'm no expert on the difference but I'm guessing Medicaid is better.  But is it a significant problem to get a fully subsidized bronze plan instead (or a $8 per month silver plan)?"

Duh), so 18% may not have been a hardship at all. In my opinion, you are looking at things backwards...

I *want* us to have privacy, but I also totally *get* the reasons a lot of scholars see for the fourth not providing it.

"Yeah I have no idea how it compares when it comes to buying power because I don't know your expenses. Here's an example I made based on my life.\n\nI earned 25740 SEK on my November payslip (Swedish average in 2010 was 28400 SEK). It's currently 6.44 SEK per USD.\n\nOn that my company deducted 6110 for tax, which is about 23.7% and I've never had to pay any additional money when my yearly tax records are sent to me from the government.\n\nOn top of that we do have a lot of sales tax (normally it's 25% but some goods and services have 6% or 12% depending on what it is). All prices you see in stores though are with the tax included so I never have to try to figure out what I actually have to pay when I'm buying something.\n\nFor the left over money I have to pay 5895 SEK in rent, though that includes a home insurance and accident insurance. I live in a 4th floor 2 room appartment (~613 sq ft) 15 minutes walking distance from the town center, in a good neighbourhood.\n\nAdd another 500 SEK for electricity each month, but the rent and electricity is about the only fixed fees I have to pay.\n\nAs a reference, a pizza is about 75 SEK, a Big Mac meal is 58 SEK, and GTA V for either console was 549 SEK. A liter of lactose free milk is around 16 or 17 SEK, a liter of gas is between 13-14 SEK depending on where you live but I don't use a car so I avoid that cost. A pack of cigarettes is 53 but I don't smoke either. (Remember, tax is included in all the prices).\n\nI think I save on average 5000 SEK per month or so and I still buy basically everything I need or want.

"The problem with the article is that it does not mention a single economist who belongs to this \"phalanx\" nor cites any recent research. \n\nI am liberal and would like nothing more for this to conform to my worldview, but the data doesn't support it.  The literature, to my understanding, between economic growth and economic inequality is largely inconclusive.   \n\nThe lack of recovery is primarily stemming from our fiscal drag and anemic housing recovery.  Household consumption has rebounded back quite nicely and above pre-recession levels.  \n\nThe simple truth is that if the public sector grew at the same rate as its long run 40 year average, the unemployment rate would be under 6%.  Combine a little infrastructure spending, we would be at full employment.  Instead, we have experienced an unprecedented contraction in the public sector, which is holding back recovery.  We are not supposed to take demand out of an economy that lacks demand. \n\nGranted we could have probably weathered the recession better if middle/lower class wages haven't stagnated for decades, but I don't see it as a significant culprit holding back our current recovery. \n\nThis does not mean I want to ignore inequality.  In fact, it is something that I am sincerely concerned about, and have been for quite a few years.  While some inequality is being driven by market forces and technology, a good chunk of it is being driven by policy decision.  As a nation, we made the conscience decision to widen inequality by voting in the neoliberal/conservative (Republicans and Democrats) over the past four decades.  Attacked unions, demonized the working class, eulogized the \"job creators\", slashed top marginal tax rates while at the same time attacking safety nets,  let the minimum wage erode, passed lopsided \"Free Trade\" agreements, passed deregulation which hurt the middle class while lining the pockets of the rich, etc. \n\n\nWe could reverse some of the damage if we had the political will.  While it is nice to see that more Americans are becoming cognizant of this travesty, we also live in America - where a large and vocal segment of the population would scream bloody communism if we started to rollback some of these neoliberal policies and pass policies to strengthen the middle class. \n\n\n\n"

"Still on this?  \n\n&gt;The reality is that many of the incompetent teachers neither quit nor were fired, but rather, are still in the NYS public school system. \n\nThat's what we call a claim. Generally speaking, unless supported with evidence, and reasoning, it should be considered to be about as valid as any other unsupported opinion ever offered.  You haven't offered evidence to support any claims you have made in this entire thread, and your reasoning has essentially been \"c'mon...\"\n\nHere's an example of how that works:  \n\nTeacher attrition rate is nationally [~16%, and climbs to over 20% in many urban districts](http://nctaf.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/NCTAF-Cost-of-Teacher-Turnover-2007-policy-brief.pdf). Those are your quitters (evidence). So, of the 30K teachers in NYC (PS- I think you mean NYC whenever you write NYS), if we assume a significantly lower-than-average attrition rate of 10% (reasoning), and assume that only half of that is people who are \"incompetent\" (ex burnt out, unhappy, not good, etc.) then that's 1500 incompetent teachers leaving every year that don't show up as \"fired\"(claim). \n\nSee how that works?  Of course you do, but it won't make a difference. By getting your knickers in a twist over the style of my rhetoric, you've successfully been able to avoid answering any of the questions that I've asked you, or had to respond to any point I've raised, while being able to insult me personally a few times, to boot. \n\nI'll leave it to any future reddit-anthropologist to look at this thread and see who is really arguing in bad faith here. \n\n"

I don't get why you're against regulation of an industry with such potential for corruption. \n\nLast year, a friend of my sister's from the Czech republic was Skyping with us and told us that in the Czech republic, distilled liquor had been temporarily banned nationwide due to a scandal where some distilleries had cut corners and dodged regulations, and ended up making a bunch of vodka with methlyl alcohol in it, and a ton of people went blind from drinking it. Regulations exist for a reason, it isn't just the big, bad State trying to stand on your neck. "

While the mainstream media may find it easily digestible for its audience to simply break down the debate into scientist vs Republicans, it's a very different part of the issue that bothers me and many others. \n\nI take the fact of climate change for granted. I concede that history shows that climate change is a reality. I also concede that mankind has impacted the environment such that climate change is not following past trajectories. Finally, I concede that action must be taken. \n\nWhere I differ from many others who accept the above is that I view geoengineering as the logical solution to the problems that we will face as a result of rapid change. The fact that we can unintentionally have such a drastic impact on such an enormous force such as the climate, is only proof of principle that we can control our entire ecosystem and manage our planet in a rational and actually sustainable way. I see the answer as planetary management.\n\nUnfortunately, this will require greater sources of energy then are currently being lauded by those put forth by the mainstream media as the rationale minds in the climate debate.  Fission, not solar, fusion, not wind light the path out of our turmoil. Future generations will hate us, but for failing to increase their energy capacity, leaving them lesser rights to consumption, and failing to give them a greater power to master their planet. "

"This is how terrorism works:\n\nTerrorists cause neo-violence in a country one way or another, causing fear within the country and its government. For America, it was 9/11. For Kenya, it was the mall attacks earlier this year. This fear causes the government to try and tighten security around the country, which the citizens will likely reject. Eventually, the citizens will revolt in one way or another and the government is overthrown.\n\nYou know all that security you have to go through in airports nowadays? Yeah, it's because of 9/11.

"So what are you suggesting we do to \"fix\" this situation?  Start another world war to address the balance?\n\nI understand the graph just fine.  I also understand it only takes into account American Male wages, so therefore isn't really a useful source for any sort of comparison.\n\nAlso, I was making the point that the inflation-adjusted earning being the same in 1969 (for Male Americans, let's not forget our sample size is tiny in the grand scheme of the World as a whole) doesn't really surprise me.  As time moves forward should we really expect to get any richer in the true meaning of the word?  Sure we can earn more money, but if stuff is more expensive then we really only earn the same value (regardless of the number we associate to it).\n\nIn capitalism isn't the point that the top X% take a disproportionate amount of the income?  After all, they are the ones who are providing the opportunities for others to work.  For example, without the likes of Bill Gates and Microsoft a lot of people (myself probably included) would not have had the same opportunities that we have; so why shouldn't he (and the others involved in making and maintaining the company) earn more money?\n\nPersonally, I think the whole stream that flows from the \"Occupy\" movement(s) stinks of over-entitlement.  Granted kids were told they wouldn't get a good job unless they went into higher education, and depending on where you are there is a significant cost (some real, some not so real) associated with that, however it was never a guarantee.  \n\nIf people blindly followed that path and weren't able to realise themselves that the world had begun to change and simply having a degree (for simplicity, let's ignore the fact that the higher education establishments have allowed subjects with little real-world value to have degrees associated to them, even though that is probably a bigger player in this whole issue) was a guarantee of a well paid job I feel like we, as a species, are missing a bigger point.\n\nI think things need to change, but you can't just redistribute the wealth willy-nilly; it needs to be earned with hard work, which, to be honest, can actually be easier that whining and moaning while feeling hard done by the establishment."

"Although constrained by law to restrained by law to treat US citizens differently than non-US citizens, it's clear they see this simply as an administrative impediment and divide the world not into \"us\" and \"them\" but into \"them\" and \"potentially them\".\n\nThey've also lost track of the fact that liberty is inherently dangerous and that a free society chooses to live freely not because we think that somehow allowing people to run around un-checked-on is magically going to make us safer than otherwise, but because we prefer the kind of life that comes from hoping rather than fearing.  (I always like to cite William Gibson's 1993 Wired article [Disneyland with the Death Penalty](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/1.04/gibson.html) as a good illustration of this.) \n\nThe very things the nation were founded on were precisely a dislike of such things, which is why the Bill of Rights contains specific protections against it.  And although the Fourth Amendment is much cited, I think i's also [the Third](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution#Text), at least in spirit, that's being trampled here. \n \n&gt; No Soldier shall, in time of peace be quartered in any house, without the consent of the Owner, nor in time of war, but in a manner to be prescribed by law.\n\nYet they have, for all practical purposes, taken up quarters in our houses as if needing to be ever-present and ever-prepared for an ever-raging war on our own soil.  There is always some risk, certainly, but there are many risks in free society.  The response to 9/11, not to mention [the cost](http://open.salon.com/blog/kent_pitman/2010/08/25/the_cost), has been utterly disproportionate."

You can almost predict what someone believes about climate change depending on their political persuasion and which news channels they watch.

Because politics gets involved, I've seen people get angry and almost gloat about climate change being a \"liberal lie\" when they see it snow. Its pointless to argue when they treat facts about our reality as religious blasphemy. I hope they live to see it right before their own eyes though, so that at least they can see they were being manipulated and mislead for political reasons.

"\"Currently winning\" is a bit of a strech.   He won a few battles, but for the most part, the war is a stalemate; Assad is controlling his millitary bases and some big cities, but the rebels hold huge sections of the country, including most of the countryside, and while Assad can bomb and do air-strikes against rebel held areas, he hasn't been able to send ground forces in there.\n\nTaking these rebel-held neighborhoods close to his capital city have been a major priority of his for most of the war, it's a huge strategic weakness, and he hasn't been able to do it.\n\nAnyway, this wasn't the first time he used chemical weapons; the first time he used them, on a smaller scale, we didn't really do anything (except threaten to send some light weapons to the rebels, and even that didn't really happen to any large degree).  He probably assumed that he could use them again without serious repercussions.  When he did realize that he had miscalculated our response and his chemical attacks might bring the US into the war, he changed tacks and agreed to give the weapons up."

"To be fair, the US gets all of the bad press because theyre the only country where any scale of extend can actually be taken. Theres obviously things known about other countries participating, but noone really known about how massively they are/were involved. A small scale of checking for actual security threats is something I figured every nation did and something I considered and still consider very much reasonable. Thats still a long shot from the extent as well a the willingness to  abuse it (that whole \"blackmailing through pornhabits\" thingy that was revealed a while ago for example) that the NSA has so far been revealed to have. Based on all I know the stuff that other nations did isnt nearly on the level of what the NSA did. Im not a fan of it, certainly, but for me its a difference between \"disliking it but can get my head behind it\" and \"wtf is dis..\".\n\nId also like to point out that its not about what nations are involved in this shit, its about what organizations are, and the NSA are by far the biggest player for all we really know right now. Which means that only america or rather its citizens can put a stop to it. I have no exact idea how deep my own government is involved in this. I can speculate, sure, but I have hardly any facts and the facts I do have arent really scary. Im also completely powerless against the actually scary faction, namely the NSA. It annoys me greatly to see people who would have power over it because its in their own damn country, under their own damn government, point at other nations and say \"you guys are (maybe) just as bad!) instead of actually doing something about it. I know that if this happened in my country this shit just wouldnt fly. We had proverbial heads rolling for much less (and will see them roll should more be revealed), and nobody would really give a shit about what other nations did and didnt do. What annoys me is not any kind of \"worming out of the issue\" or anything. I couldnt care less about who takes the blame as long as something is done about it. What annoys me is that from what I can tell a lot of people from the US seem to rather want point fingers at other nations in order to claim that \"they are just as bad\" instead of doing something about it while being in the priviliged situation of actually being able to do so. I could yell at my government all I wanted to, I would still lack any information that Id need to actually make a strong case against it. Maybe they did something, maybe they didnt, I dont know. And as long as I dont know what exactly my government did I cant really try to stop it. I certainly dont want to attempt to pressure a complete change of government through demonstrations and the like based on a suspicion. US citizens *know* that this NSA stuff is going on. So why the hell is the government getting away with it?"

"There is no giving too much power to the NSA, they have all the power to begin with. The people who want the NSA to exist have all the power in our society. They do not cede any power, they merely want the services that an organization like the NSA provides.\n\nI don't believe in those movies where suddenly someone took power, or suddenly the final boss (think Bowser) is defeated and all is well.\n\nFor instance there was a very real war between the capitalist class and the feudal class. In America it ended with the victory of the founding fathers who created a society in which private property rules all (think slavery, capital), in France it ended with the decapitation of the monarch, in England and the Netherlands it ended with the transfer of power from the monarch to parliament (the 'monarchy' was allowed to be maintained as a cultural symbol)."

"\"When in college government class, you always learn about the government's endless grab for power; that it is always the citizens duty to keep it in check.\"\n\nI think this is nonsense though. \n\nThere is no secret government power grab that wants to corrupt our pure and moral society. The government exists because those with all the power want it to exist. Individual capitalists can lobby for bigger or smaller government depending on what is profitable at the time. Sometimes the individual capitalists can be at odds, but the state remains the expression of the combined will of the capitalist class.\n\nThe real transfers of power are out in the open. There is no corruption, only groups of people struggling for power.\n\nTake the war between the feudal class and the capitalist class for example. In the US it ended with the victory of the founding fathers and as such private property (think slavery, capital) prevailed over the last remnants of monarchism. In France it ended with the decapitation of the monarch. In England and the Netherlands it ended with the transfer of power from the monarchy to parliament. The kings and queens were allowed to stay as a cultural symbol, though powerless in practice.\n\nThere is no corruption from the outside.

"We are all responsible for our government's actions, but it's not a case of direct responsibility, because we're not dealing with a clear-cut cause-and-effect situation where you can say, \"you did (or did not) do X, therefore Y happened as a direct result and you should be held responsible.\" Unfortunately, it's much more of a gray area than that, but there is a certain degree of indirect, *collective* responsibility.\n\nNazi Germany provides an obvious example: no single ordinary German citizen was directly responsible for allowing the Nazi regime to happen, but atrocities were committed under everyone's watch and in their name, and so they must face the consequences as a people. That's the point: the government represents us (in theory), so it is our responsibility to ensure that things are as kosher as we can keep them."

The welfare state creates a dependent class of people with virtually zero social mobility. Our economic policies and over-regulation make starting businesses incredibly expensive and difficult, and prevent many people from having opportunities at all. In a free society there would be fewer poor people to begin with because there would not be a government to a) take a large % of their income to waste, b) create policies which hurt the poor, c) give the rich a platform to hurt the poor further. \n\n\n&gt;Also you see this non regulated market place that would take care of itself but who would break up the inevitable monopolies and who is going to ensure perfect information so that buyers know if the products they buy are safe and not harming themselves and the environment?\n\nBefore accusing me of jumping into the deep end of libertarianism you might want to wade into the shallow part of the pool. Your points are very basic and easily refuted/addressed by libertarian theory, namely property rights and free markets. Monopolies in a free society are almost always impossible to sustain. Government makes them possible\n\n&gt;certainly when we have an elite in this country wanting just what you are proposing.\n\nI'm sorry, but that's just not true. The elite want to use the government to their own ends. I'm advocating elimination of government altogether. A company, without government, must voluntarily win business in order to succeed, instead of bribing the politicians to squash their competition. \n\n&gt;It's like we are trying to recreate the past where people had to pick the rat shit out of our food and hope the factory owner doesn't lock the doors incase there is a fire.\n\nIn a free society those things wouldn't happen either, and the \"corporation\" wouldn't be legally protected from their actions. Again, government gives them the power to harm free of consequence."

Even if....even if you can imagine a scenario where the US gov't does away with the NSA, do you believe you can secure this data from multinational corporations with sales larger than most countries GDP?\n\nOur last president used coke, pot, and had a DWI. Our current president was a pot head in high school. In twelve years we'll have a president who has masturbated to 4chan. His/her masturbation material will probably be released on air during a reality-internet youtube show sponsored by Apple - and we won't give a shit - just as long as he/she doesn't have sex with androids or genetically modified humans."

It's obvious that this administration and congress are going to do nothing to change it. We voted for a president who promised transparency, rule of law, etc. and then turned and laughed in our faces when in office. I think a large percentage of America is genuinely pissed about this issue which would compel them to vote for a candidate that promised to defund these programs. Not much else we can do beyond that. \n\nAs to what other countries can do. Stop being the lapdogs for the US in relation to these issues. The failure of countries like Germany to give Snowden asylum, and then pretending to be \"shocked and appalled\" when revelations come about concerning NSA spying in their country speaks to how complicit they are in this.

"&gt;  why does the government get away with mandating that private employers conduct certain unreasonable searches and seizures under the \"drug free workplace\" initiative if the government is not allowed to directly conduct those searches for welfare recipients?\n\nIt doesn't.\n\nWhat you're talking about here is *probably* the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988. It does require a lot of reporting and handing out pamphlets and firing employees with drug convictions, but does not require drug tests.

"The recent book \"Average Is Over\" by Tyler Cowen predicts that 10-15% of people in the US will have decent/good incomes and those people are the ones who can interact with intelligent machines (because automation will be everywhere). The remaining 85-90% of Americans will have what we consider to be lower-middle-class wages and will do what they can to get the best quality of life at their budget level. He argues this is already happening with people moving to places like Texas where a middle class lifestyle (house etc.) is (for now) affordable on a lower income. The American dream that we're all going to be upper-middle with a McMansion, new cars, country-club comfortable hospitals and colleges, won't hold up.  The problem is, because that's been the dream and the assumption, we're structured so much of our system around it, that the lower-cost options (more public services, less fancied-up education and health care facilities, etc.) have languished. We have too much structured for upper-income people and there won't be enough of them, and not enough ootions for lower income people so they'll go without.  Too many McMansions, not enough modest homes. Too much expensive health care, not enough affordable basic care. "

Even so called \"unskilled\" occupations in a modern society may involved continuous work with high-technology gadgets.\n\nMake no mistake, the current drop in wages is a result of one thing and one thing only: abuse of raw power."

"ACA imposes medical loss ratios that keep the prices in check.

Although the morning after pill is OTC that's a different issue, it's not intended to be used as routine birth control.\n\nThe reason I use the word \"Free\" is because the studies on abortion made the contraceptive free, and because much of the research literature is from other countries where contraceptives are provided free of charge in the socialized medicine scheme of that country.  In our insuance scheme in the USA it is not truly \"free\" in that someone is paying a premium or a tax to subsidize someone else, but when you later walk into CVS and pick up a birth control prescription with no copay, it feels \"free\" and that's what's important -- there's no perceived barrier to access, which increases use, which again reduces unplanned pregnancy which has a positive waterfall effect on the woman, her children, and the economy in general."

"&gt;But we aren't destroying ourselves.\n\n&gt;The threat of terrorism is used by our governments to redistribute Western taxpayer's money to the military industry and other big capitalists. In the meantime the military is used to subdue foreign populations so rich Western capitalists can plunder the planet.\n\nDespite the hyperbolic language, I think this is the most prescient comment in this thread so far. With the Cold-War threat of communism largely defeated, neo-cons and similarly post-colonial hawks needed a new excuse to wage wars in the Middle East and elsewhere with the central aim of securing resources and consolidating America's power in these newly established spheres of influence.\n\nTerrorism was and is the perfect excuse for our government to wage war abroad under the guise of a vague \"terrorist\" threat. This is true regardless of whether 9/11 was a manufactured event (for all you conspiracy theorists out there) or Al Qaeda was stupid enough to invite American aggression by carrying out such a massive attack on US soil.\n\nWith a clear and present danger well established in the American public's mind, the military was free to pursue its goal of global dominance in the 21st century without massive public interference. I suspect that the NSA's domestic spying operations are simply part and parcel of this larger game."
"I don't understand where all the cost came from.  \n  \nI worked for a substance abuse treatment center and we only paid ~.69 per 9 panel test. Didn't the numbers come out to like more than $4 per test in FL? What lab did they use? Lol. We used one in Maine and they even gave us prepaid shipping labels. The only additional costs were to pay employees to collect it. (Which was me: yup I looked at penis all day for a living. -.-).  \n  \nI'm on the fence on issues like this because I saw and heard first hand hundreds upon hundreds of people talking about selling their assistance for drugs, trading it for cash to get drugs, etc.  \nOn top of that, I'm curious how FL did the screenings. Were they observed? If not, WHY THE HELL NOT? Unobserved urine screenings are easy as hell to cheat. You can even cheat on observed tests but it's much harder. So that could have also messed with the results of who was caught and who wasn't.  \n  \nBut at the same time if it's proven to be a waste of resources and money, why do it?

"That is exactly what I am saying. And it most absolutely does not make sense.

The people who wrote Obamacare made the assumption that the states would expand Medicaid for those who are below the Federal Poverty Line thereby taking care of them. 25 states (50% of the US) did- states like Texas did not causing this no-mans-land for people like me. So I do not get a subsidy and I do not qualify for Medicaid. On top of that, you add the fact that the cheapest insurance I can get (with an even higher deductible than before) is 70% higher than what I was paying which priced me out of insurance at all. It was a full complete total fail for me. Seems like they could not have made it much worse for 5 million people who need assistance the most."

At the same time, it's taking advantage of the resulting public fear to increase its own power. \n\nAgain, the misunderstanding is that the government is making a bunch of foolish policy decisions that are unwittingly hurting our civil liberties and \"destroying our way of life.\" They're making a deliberate power grab for the sake of power, and they're using \"the war on terrorism\" as the justification."

They could have then taken action at the federal level to plug this gap before finalizing their plan. \n\nI don't think the fine will apply when your income is below the Federal Poverty Line.

"&gt; All that means is pregnancy should be covered and I don't see anyone arguing it shouldn't.\n\nThe costs of unwanted pregnancies on our society are far, far greater than a couple of birth control pills.  Our society owes it to itself to ensure that if a woman does not want to get pregnant, she won't (inasmuch as our medical technology will allow).\n\nThat is the argument.  There is no adequate retort to this argument, other than \"an imaginary guy in a book written three hundred and fifty years after his imaginary death is being interpreted by a bunch of old crotchety fucks [who died five hundred years ago] as having said it's immoral, even though he never actually said that, and there's no real passage in said book which says it, either.\"\n\nThe cost argument is pointless.  Paying for birth control reduces insurance costs by ten thousand-fold.\n\nThe moral argument is pointless.  You're not allowed to instill your religion on others in this country.  Me having access to birth control does not instill my religion on you, nor does it in any way prevent you from full practice of your religion or force you to participate in some imaginary-on-your-part immoral act.  If a church paid a handyman money, and that handyman used that money to regularly rape and murder women, the church does not assume upon itself blame for said rape and murders.  Yet somehow they would \"be to blame\" for allowing women to get birth control on insurance programs that they [kind of but not really] pay for?  Patently fucking absurd.\n\nThe \"it's my tax money\" argument is pointless.  You're not allowed to direct your tax money.\n\nThe \"it's cheap, pay for it yourself\" argument is pointless.  It's \"cheap\" to whoever makes this argument because they are not fucking poor, and probably have no concept of what poor is.\n\nIn short, \n\n&gt; We have bigger health fish to fry.\n\nI'd like you to provide some kind of citation on how millions of unwanted children [those that we would have if it cost the equivalent of a dollar in birth control for each fuck in the United States] is not one of the biggest healthcare fish in the United States, not to mention one of the easiest and cheapest to fry.  We can't stop cancer [yet], but birth control is pretty fucking easy.  Not to mention, it has numerous beneficial side-effects unrelated to pregnancy."

Jump out at them, and they will confuse to raping, killing, maiming, or anything they didn't do... this is your point, albeit a bad one, isn't it?\n\n&gt;It's a free choice? Really?\n\n - Let me type this out for you very slowly - y. e.s  It is a free choice of what they said. Did someone else own/use their lips? No. Their tongue? no. Their jaws? no again... \n\n&gt; When they risk being locked up for 20+ years if they refuse because prosecutors can keep piling on charges beyond what they can reasonably prove in court?\n\n - And then they go to court, and then what, if they haven't done anything? They are free, and sue the ass of those that did it. Unless (And here is the big thing that torpedo's your P.O.V - there are an arm's length's of priors... which in the vast majority of these cases there are.). So again - you have nothing.\n\n&gt;This is pretty fucking racist.\n\n - And the goto card yet again, for things you can't dismiss. YOu are racist. This entire \"get out of jail free\" racist card has done uncountable harm to the black community, and you should feel bad perpetuating it. But you won't, because it will make you feel ..something, while more and more kids are born without fathers around, without a male role model, without a sense of purpose, etc, etc, etc, etc but hey - at least you got to pat yourself on the back for not being whatever is now being defined as \"racist\". \n\n&gt;It's a common fallacy that people believe drug users and dealers in ghettos sell in the open air more.\n\n - I live in the ghetto you ignoramus. Always have. Although, it wasn't the ghetto when it started. Go ahead, ask me how it got that way. Hint, it had a lot to do with numbnuts like yourself that are incapable, apparently, to see the truth for fear of social retaliation, and you are willing to hurt as many blacks/minorities as you need to make sure you aren't racist... For fucks sake, be a man.\n\n&gt;The fact of the matter is police target ghettos because they can without any political fallout. \n\n - No, it is because it is like shooting fish in a barrel. If you give the cops a case on a silver platter, they have to take it. Just like the, I am sure you see no issue of, the white guy being charged with the KO game, despite the dozens, upon dozens of black on white KO game altercations - the difference&gt; You guessed it, this one was handed to them on a silver platter. Just like all the petty black drug offenses. The point, if you dare the cops to do something - you can't cry(As you have) about them doing it..\n\n&gt;Imagine the same kind of tactics used in a surburban white neighborhood and suddenly you have cries of police brutality.\n\n - See previous comment. \n\n&gt;So their crime is acting like a gangster and having a \"fuck the police\" attitude? Seriously?\n\n - Yes, the same way if you walk down the street daring people to knock the chip off your shoulders, and someone knocks the chip(And your head) off your shoulders, you have no right to cry about it. Seriously, this can't be news to you? Have we really treated an entire portion of society with such kid gloves that you are incapable of seeing(Or refusing?) to understand cause and effect? \n\n&gt;When was this a crime in which you could be charged with a felony?\n\n - It isn't, and that isn't what they are charged for. But if you have a laundry list of priors, and have acted like a dick - you don't have the right to complain that the cops are treating you like someone that has a laundry list of priors and acts like a dick..\n\nSeriously you need to grow the fuck up.\n\n\n\n"

"&gt; They aren't extending protections, they are taking them away.\n\nThe fourth amendment talks about meta data and even data stored on third party property are extensions. \n\n&gt; ...and many more places the 4th doesn't apply where it seems to me it clearly should.\n\nAnd that's the problem.  The fourth amendment protects persons, houses, papers, and effects.  It says nothing about the concept of privacy.  It specifically lists concrete protections offered.  What of the above list is \"meta data from phone records\" included under?  It's not your person, not your house / home, not your papers (identity papers) and not your property.  So what statute, exactly, protects that data?  Constitutional law is to be construed narrowly to avoid situations where someone argues that carrying a nuke is protected by the second amendment.  We can't let the *result* of a constitutional ruling (see, \"Citizens United\" for a prime example) being a reason to have the judiciary change the law as it is actually written.  That's not their job!  The legislature needs to do theirs.\n\nAnd that's my only point, we need the legislature to pass laws that specifically protects the concept of privacy.  This would make it impossible for the judiciary to move one way or the other on the matter, and thus make it impossible for a future court to revert a ruling granting us the protection we want.  \n\nJust because I *wish* the fourth would protect more of my life, and that I think it should have, I can't realistically argue that it actually does.

"I can't argue results. So the question is why did you see the results you saw? Would you see those results if you went to another urban area? To a predominantly white area? Given the unemployment rate I would have expected a lot more than 13 applications for a job that pays more than twice the minimum wage. At the very least you should have gotten all the people working at McDonald's or Checker's (or whatever they have in Baltimore).\n\nBottom line is what does it all mean and what, if anything, can be done about it? Many who would insist on 'personal responsibility' to fix the problem are really in a camp that insists that doubling down on neglect will improve things. That if people are miserable enough they will start acting responsibly. Looking around at humanity around the world would imply that not only does this seem to be untrue. Also that it carries terrible costs. \n\n"

Federal taxes have been stagnant for almost as long.\n\nThere's also constant complaining that what money does come in via the gas tax is redirected to fill other budget holes (hence the shenanigans around toll roads). Add too that the fact that cars are much more efficient now and we end up collecting less in taxes per mile driven than ever before while having more cars wearing down more miles of road than ever before. All of this adds up to a failing infrastructure and a republican legislature taking billions from the \"rainy day fund\" to pay for basic maintenance and new growth.\n\nBut at least our taxes won't go up."

You cannot have a society based on private property without those that benefit from private property defending it. Capitalists need a state.

"Yet the two ideologies you listed don't seem contradictory. Crony capitalism isn't any different from regular capitalism, its the same thing. Crony capitalists are capitalists who just happen to be playing by the rules of capitalism and are very successful at that.\n\n&gt;The other ideology is the idea that capitalism as an economic system is the system we live in and produces the results that we see in the world, both the good and the bad. Removing the bad results is synonymous with the rethinking of the way our society works though rethinking does not have to come first.\n\nCapitalism as a system produces the societal structure we see, but I would be wary to say that it produces technological or advancing results. \n\nI don't think the goal should be to remove bad results of capitalism, but rather to remove capitalism. Removing results only treats the symptoms, removing the fundamental flaw cures the illness. "

"&gt; Actually, it isn't. Being scared doesn't mean you have no choice. Seriously, you can't be this weak willed.\n\n*Weak willed?* Holy fuck dude.

They are free, and sue the ass of those that did it. Unless (And here is the big thing that torpedo's your P.O.V - there are an arm's length's of priors... which in the vast majority of these cases there are.). So again - you have nothing.\n\nThey can't because they often are *too poor to afford an attorney*. In fact when charged with drug crimes many meet maybe 11 minutes with a public defender who tells them to plea deal.\n\n&gt; And the goto card yet again, for things you can't dismiss. YOu are racist. This entire \"get out of jail free\" racist card has done uncountable harm to the black community, and you should feel bad perpetuating it. But you won't, because it will make you feel ..something, while more and more kids are born without fathers around, without a male role model, without a sense of purpose, etc, etc, etc, etc but hey - at least you got to pat yourself on the back for not being whatever is now being defined as \"racist\".\n\nAh the white supremacist version of racist. The part about fathers is particularly cringe worthy since the drug war locked up a lot of the fathers.\n\n&gt; No, it is because it is like shooting fish in a barrel.\n\nExcept this is not true at all. The drug war in poor black neighborhoods is actually very ineffective at reducing drug use. Police would really have a better chance of making more arrests in suburban white neighborhoods. \n\n&gt; It isn't, and that isn't what they are charged for. But if you have a laundry list of priors, and have acted like a dick - you don't have the right to complain that the cops are treating you like someone that has a laundry list of priors and acts like a dick..\n\nSo black people are treated every day like criminals. They are stopped and searched at far higher rates than other races even though they are less likely to carry drugs on them. They are told every day that they are criminals. The laundry list of priors can be as short as even one or two drug convictions.\n\nThey can fucking lose public housing. \"Oh,\" you might say, \"but it's their decision for smoking weed.\" But, 1. why do black and poor people have to be held to higher standards than white people? 2. They can be completely innocent. If their kid smokes weed, or if a caretaker smokes weed, or anyone that can be connected to them in a similar manner, they can be kicked out of their home and become homeless.\n\n&gt; Seriously you need to grow the fuck up.\n\nGrowing the fuck up means that you should become a racist dickwad? I disagree. Growing the fuck up means taking responsibility and realizing that we still live in a very, very, racist society. It means self introspection and caring about other people. It means identifying problems and advocating racial and social justice."

"Im from germany, actually, so I can tell you that granting him asylum in germany would probably be the most terrible solution for all parties involved. For one were still economically dependant on the US to the point where we really dont want them having a hissy fit against us, and even though we could probably get away with granting him asylum without getting completely crushed we have absolutely nothing to measure muscles with the US on the matter. We still have a somewhat relevant military force in germany ever since WWII (thanks Hitler!) so I doubt hed be \"safe\" here. Sure, kidnapping him would be a violation of international law and all that, but i strongly doubt the US would actually care. Not like they did at all in the past, and theres really nothing we could do about it individually. A trade embargo would be nice and all, but it would completely ruin us to the point of being in a worse situation than greece, so that wouldnt happen. On the other hand Russia, despite being a lot weaker than during the cold war, are still really really threatening, have actual programs that would prevent that the US could just grab snowden (we have a rather pitiful spending on intelligence agencies iirc, which is also why I doubt that the german government was/is involved too deeply, alltho I suspect it was more than we currently know) and are not completely economically dependant on the US. They are the guy that the States really dont want to mess with, so the current solution really is by far the best, at least if Russia lets him stay in their country (and Im pretty sure they will, theres no better publicity for russia and especially Putin, people actually like him now, and seeing how narcisstic he tends to be he probably gets a raging hard on just from that o_O).\n\nNow, in regards of heads rolling.. we got pretty damn close to getting national demonstrations and had huge local demonstrations over a goddamn railway station that was gonna be built anyway because people figured that there were smarter ways to go about it. One thing about germany is that were really really sensitive about demonstrations, to the point where they get huge amounts of attention in the media which tends to snowball the effect ridiculously hard. In a situation like this *a lot* of very vocal and very open protests would occur until the government stepped back. Since any political party that wouldnt instantly comply and attempt to find scapegoats who \"abused their power\" get gutted politically to the point of never being relevant again heads would roll very quickly. Somebody like Snowden could return completely safely after a couple of months.\n\nI guess my main concern is that the political landscape of the US doesnt seem to be able to actually drastically change the situation. In four years well have two new guys that will promise change and transparency, but because its only two parties theyll probably have a gentlemans agreement to not really go through with it. In a situation lile this Id expect to see a lot of citizens of any democratic nation strongly strive to change the current situation through very strong and very vocal protests.

The need to secure resources in the Middle East certainly hasn't diminished.\n\nThe motive is there, the need is there, the documentation is there.

And even still breaking through that cognitive dissonance barrier is difficult.  Look at the equally naive \"Snowden should have reported things through proper channels\" replies.

So I spend more money on equipment to make my guys' jobs easier and more efficient. \n\nIf my net benefit from that is that they will demand additional pay, then I'm clearly not going to buy the equipment.\n\nBased on your earlier comment, if they used to mow 8 lawns in 8 hours, but could now mow 12, they should just mow the same 8 lawns in 5:20 and get the extra time to themselves.\n\nYou are absolutely correct, IF AND ONLY IF, they are paid per task, and are independently contracted through me. This means they have to invest their own money on the equipment that makes their lump sum (per lawn) price more efficient for them. Otherwise, I'm earning the same income (8 lawns) but my costs go up (labor is the same, equipment costs are increased) and have zero incentive to invest in more efficient equipment.\n\nThe argument that my capital investment that improves worker productivity necessarily increases worker pay is just based on emotion. If I'm one of the more technologically advanced mowing companies, why would I pay my workers more than before? If they become angry that I'm making more revenue than before and don't want to share it with them? They can leave and any one of the hundreds of mowers from my competitors (who have to use push mowers) would be happy to take the easier job with my company for the same pay. Unless there are some market forces making it suddenly harder to find and hire guys to operate a sit-on mower, what's my incentive to increase pay?"

You are making more money because of your investment, not because your workers did anything other than what they've always done.

"Well, we aren't talking about every other country on earth, we're talking about the US. Health care spending in the US is really silly. There are actually two systems (or more, depending on who you ask). When people say the US spends more for health care, they are largely referring to the \"private\" system, where in other countries this cost would be paid for in taxes. \n\nWhat makes the American health care industry weird is the multiple systems I mentioned above. Total American expenditures are something like double per capita what other countries spend, but as with many things the devil is in the details and that number (like so many aggregates) is meaningless without looking at the different parts. About half of US expenditures are in the \"private\" health care system, and the other half is in the public system. This doesn't mean that half of Americans are in both systems, just that half the money is spent by the government and the other half by private sources (insurance and individuals). Actually, if you look at the number of people in the public systems in America, there are fewer. The per capita spending on public systems is greater than the per capita spending often quoted for the general population. Example: [Medicare](http://kff.org/medicare/state-indicator/per-enrollee-spending-by-residence/). Medicaid is a bit better for [some population segments](http://kff.org/medicaid/state-indicator/medicaid-payments-per-enrollee/) but the overall point that there are multiple systems isn't to be overlooked. \n\nThen you've got the regulations I mentioned above. For one, there's the [certificate of need](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_of_need) that literally allows competitors to determine whether or not they will allow other competitors into the market. Then there's the [conservative bias of the FDA](http://www.forbes.com/sites/aroy/2012/04/24/how-the-fda-stifles-new-cures-part-i-the-rising-cost-of-clinical-trials/) that costs companies significantly more to bring drugs (and many medical devices) to market, then at the same time gives those companies monopolies on the ability to sell the drug ([more](http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/PharmaceuticalsEconomicsandRegulation.html)). There's also an upward effect on prices caused by government putting money into the health care system through Medicare and Medicaid; when Medicare was first enacted, government spending was near 0% but now it is around 50% and health care spending per capita has more than doubled."

That is why it keeps coming up as being an issue in swing states and states where they need to maintain legislative control.   \n* Voter suppression efforts has been ramped up in many states to suppress the female/minority vote as the gop knows they've lost those demographics. This helps more with house districts than statewide senate districts I think.  \n* GOP panders to their base hard and does a good job up riling them up with wedge issues and fear/propaganda through conservative media. I think they do a much better job of this than the dems do. Look at some of the polls out there to see what conservatives believe. An impressive amount still believe obama isn't a u.s. citizen, that dems caused the shutdown, that obama is a communist and so forth. Uneducated low-information voters are easily persuaded of just about anything and rarely question the source of anything these days which is unfortunate.\n\nI think they realize they can't win the overall majority vote anymore through policy alone which is why they resort to strategy such as those three listed above. They would *like* to win on policy though which is why there will continue to be a lot of in-fighting until they are able to break free of the tea-party and religious right which drive a lot of their social policy at the moment. \n\nThough many hate on the GOP on reddit, in a two-party system it is important for us to have two parties that are balanced and producing quality policy through compromise. A yin-yang relationship if you will. The sooner the GOP can get their shit together and start producing good policy alternatives again, the better for all of us. \n\nSource: worked on the hill for the senate, as a lobbyist, and campaign strategist.

Get back to me after junior year, sport.\n\n&gt; Exactly, we don't insure maxi pads.\n\nBut we do cover Viagra and other ED pills.  And vacuum erection devices.  And penile implants.  And vasectomies.  And circumcision.  All of those things are expected, routine items related to sexual health...for men.\n\nBirth control is less expensive and far more preventative than all of those things.\n\n&gt; Its also an incredibly reasonable expense for you to pay out of pocket, especially since its so damn cheap, \n\nIt *can* be cheap.  It can also be seriously fucking expensive (and is for about 10% of the female population), but you wouldn't know about that, because \"hurrr pill is so cheap bitchez pay for it yourself.\"  So where do we draw the line?  12 dollars a month?  20 dollars?  50 dollars?  120 dollars a month?\n\nYou can't draw that line.\n\n&gt; and insurance companies just raise the cost of their plans and charge it back to you.\n\nJust like they do everything else, insurance companies absorb that cost over the entirety of their customer-base.  Those that need BC get it, those that don't get the benefit of not having a million unwanted children on the streets that they have pay to cover instead.\n\nI'd be willing to bet that 80% of insurance companies don't bother, because they'd MUCH, MUCH, MUCH rather have you on birth control than getting pregnant every other time you fucked.\n\ntl;dr - we're done here.  you're wrong.  and an idiot.  this will be my last reply.\n\nHave a nice day."

"&gt;I believe Obamacare’s rocky start — **clueless planning, a lousy website,** insurance companies raising rates, and **the president’s telling people they could keep their coverage when, in fact, not all could** — is a result of one fatal flaw: The Affordable Care Act is a pro-insurance-industry plan implemented by a president who knew in his heart that a single-payer, Medicare-for-all model was the true way to go.\n\nThe parts that I bolded are actually NOT results of that single \"fatal flaw\", that the ACA is a \"pro-insurance-industry plan\". \n\nA pro-insurance company plan could have been implemented more effectively, and the web site could have at least been properly tested before the launch date. The President chose to promise people they could keep their coverage because he wanted their votes, knowing that not everyone would be able to keep it. The only thing about the plan that compelled the President to lie to the American people about this was the part about being able to get it passed in Congress and then subsequently trying to limit the political fallout from the law. \n\n&gt;What we now call Obamacare was conceived at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank,\n\n[Dishonest claim](http://blog.heritage.org/2012/02/06/dont-blame-heritage-for-obamacare-mandate/)\n\n&gt;In blue states, let’s lobby for a public option on the insurance exchange — a health plan run by the state government, rather than a private insurer. \n\nFinally, a perfectly sensible argument.

"&gt; Weak willed? Holy fuck dude. You're claiming that people who buckle when threatened by 20 years in prison are weak willed?\n\n - No, I am saying (And downvotes don;t change a damn thing), that those that admit to something they didn't do are weak willed. This isn't rocket science. I suspect no matter how much I scream at you, you won't admit to killing Kennedy, if you do, you are weak willed. \n\n&gt;Ah the white supremacist version of racist.\n\n - Ahh the goto card again. Have anything else in that deck, because I have yet to hear anything other than excuses and well, excuses.\n\n&gt;The part about fathers is particularly cringe worthy since the drug war locked up a lot of the fathers.\n\n - Yes, the lack of fathers that started in 60's, and the drug war that started in the mid 80's.. is there nothing your excuse deck can't dismiss. \n\n&gt;The drug war in poor black neighborhoods is actually very ineffective at reducing drug use. \n\n - Only because there are lies, damn lies and statistics.. The drug war, and drugs, is an ever sifting metric. However, as long as it is a \"status\" of being cool, it won't. Anymore that swearing, or spitting, or drinking underage. However, and again, that doesn't change why there are more black youth caught up in the drug crime than others. If you do it on a street corner (Including swearing, spitting, scratching nuts, etc) more people will notice than if you do it in your home... Why is this so hard to see? Afraid, you'll have to go to your nearest mirror and start to scream racist at your reflection for acknowledging the truth? \n\n&gt;Police would really have a better chance of making more arrests in suburban white neighborhoods. \n\n - Maybe, but they would have to go indoors to peoples homes - what part of this are you having a hard time with? If you do someone out in plan view, you will be noticed. If you do something behind closed doors you won't be.. That isn't racist - that is fucking common sense - of course, these days that is one in the same. \n\n&gt;So black people are treated every day like criminals. \n\n - Because statistically they are. This is of course not true for everyone, but you, nor I, nor the cops, nor anyone work on an individual basis. Not all pitbulls are violent, but I'd bet you wouldn't risk your kid with one you didn't know. That is known as common sense, and you are kidding yourself if you think that that doesn't apply to people as well. \n\n&gt;They are stopped and searched at far higher rates than other races even though they are less likely to carry drugs on them. \n\n - Because even if statisticly for drugs they aren't at a higher percentage, they are for all violent crimes, weapons, assult, rapes, and, and, and, and... and worse, even those blacks that try and point this out (like Cosby )  get vilified by the same blacks that are hurting their peers - just as you are. \n\n&gt;They are told every day that they are criminals. \n\n - Individually, they aren't. As a group they are. Again, people and cops, have to work on probabilities. Not your good feelings. \n\n&gt;The laundry list of priors can be as short as even one or two drug convictions.\n\n - And what does that tell you? Since when is one or two priors, not grounds for suspension? If Bob Smith only attacked your sister once or twice, I am guessing (Na, I know) when the third time your sister is attacked you will make a bee line right to Bob Smith ... because you are a semi intelligent animal(Despite what you are trying to portray here so you can pat yourself on the back for being \"enlightened\" at the expense of other people).\n\n&gt;They can fucking lose public housing. \n\n - Oh my freaking god.. you mean they would have to live like the rest of humanity? Ohh the ...ahh...humanity? \n\n&gt;But, 1. why do black and poor people have to be held to higher standards than white people?\n\n - They don't. they have to live up to the standards that all people have (Which means no priors), and that becomes hard when people give them excuses and forgive each and every fucked up action they do because it *has* to be someone elses fault.\n\n&gt; 2. They can be completely innocent. If their kid smokes weed, or if a caretaker smokes weed, or anyone that can be connected to them in a similar manner, they can be kicked out of their home and become homeless.\n\n - That is what happens when you live under someone elses dime. Didn't your parents ever teach you \"Under my house, you are under my rules\"? Again - this in known as being a grown up. \n\n&gt;Growing the fuck up means that you should become a racist dickwad? \n\n - No, it means being accountable and not accepting excuses for your own bad behavior. How have you managed to ignore this after no less than 4 times I have pointed it out in this thread? Ohh I know, because it must be someone elses fault. At the risk of repeating myself - grow up.\n\n&gt;I disagree. Growing the fuck up means taking responsibility and realizing that we still live in a very, very, racist society. \n\n - You are welcome to disgree, that is your right. What isn't your right is excusing each and every bad decision someone makes as the fault of some unknown(other than to you and those being charged), formless, shapeless, unprovable thought crime of others that are very easily shown as more than likely mere statistics... but I know, I know Statistics be racisis yo...\n\n&gt; It means self introspection and caring about other people.\n\n - No, it means accepting the truth born out of statistics, common sense and observable reality - something you seem to be unwilling to do. I know, it is because the system is racist... Because lets face it, that is easier than accepting responsibility for your own actions..\n\n&gt; It means identifying problems and advocating racial and social justice.\n\n - Your type of social justice has hurt the black community, condemned more black youth to poverty, and isolated them and their ability to move forward than anything any KKK member could have ever hoped for. Your ability to excuse any and all bad behavior, and delinquent personality traits, while at the same time propping up ghetto culture has destroyed entire generations... and yet still you have the audacity to think it is me being racist because I dare speak the truth? \n\nTL:DR - If you act like a thug, you'll be treated like a thug. If you look like a thus - you will be treated like a thug. If you are statistically a thug - you will be questioned like a thug....That isn't racist, that is common freaking sense.

What is happening this year is for whatever reason the media is no longer capable of ignoring this information completely.\n\nThey have also managed to maintain this framework in which 'the public' was completely ignorant and reporters were legitimately snowed, when all the information about our loss of rights and the expansion of surveillance policies internal to the usa has been in plain sight.  \n\nI am not waging war on myself, large corporations and their media arms, and a multinational elite is waging war on me.  it's not new, but anyone who thought they had some kind of respect or allegiance to american principles that protected americans from abuse and domination, needs to know they were wrong.  \n\nThe usa is a predator and abuser, it will lie and do whatever it takes to get what it wants.

Your cost examples may seem trivially expensive to you, but they won't be for many people, right?\n\nDont care at all about productivity, that shouldn't be governments focus on healthcare. Additionally it is trivial amounts compared to if health care reform goes down in flames over this (which the lawsuits may help do, and barring that the political implications that may help bring it down). \n\nI simply don't think birth control coverage today is a hill worth dying on in a health care debate. In 2 years when everything is more settled? Go for it. \n\n&gt;And I'm also willing to bet that OTC birth control doesn't work, or doesn't work well, for lots of people. Rather than try to untangle those cases, why not support the costs for everybody? \n\nAnd prescription doesn't work for everyone. And prescription can be as low as a dollar a week with genetics.

"&gt;  Those should be covered regardless of birth control so its irrelevant\n\nSo women aren't allowed medicine to prevent hundreds of complications?  \n\nAgain, so we should immediately stop heart pills and only react once the person has a heart attack.  No cholesterol medication to try and prevent that potential negative effects of high blood pressure, we simply wait for the stroke and react?\n\n&gt;Should we cover all things that can be used to prevent any medical complication? Diet Soda to prevent Type 2 Diabetes\n\nNope.  Just prescription medication.\n\n&gt;Not giving free/covered birth control is stealing? How about not giving free/covered advil? Free/covered Athsma inhalers? All of which I can buy cheaply with no coverage (generics and such).\n\nAdvil is not a perscription medication.  Inhalers are almost always covered because they are perscription medication.  See how this works?\n\n&gt;Irrelevant, I have no objection to birth control period. This doesn't refute my claim that its more expensive in lawsuits/costs to provide covered birth control, and the risk that health legislation comes crashing down due to it isn't worth\n\nThis is such a pile of garbage that its hard to know where to start.\n\nSo the fact that idiots threaten unfair lawsuits means that women should immediately surrender out rights and pay twice for medication?  No, sorry.  What if some idiot threatens a legal action to rescind our right to vote?  Do we just hand that over because the legal action will cost taxpayers money?\n\n&gt;I want you to have cheap birth control, good thing we have generics that are cheap even not covered\n\nNo.  Cost isn't the issue.  The issue is that birth control is an effective medicine and it should be covered.  I'm not going to pay extra because my employer thinks they have a right to dictate how I spend my salary.  \n\nDo I need to start showing my employer all my expenditures to make sure I meet their moral code?\n\n&gt;Unless freedom of religion is interpreted to mean that the government can't force them to pay for medication they don't believe in. (Another shady door I wish wasn't cracked open by including it, we could've avoided this whole issue).\n\nYep and we could have avoided the whole pesky civil rights movement if those silly black people just stayed slaves right?  \n\nI'm not comparing birth control to slavery but the point is the same on a lesser level.  Women should not have to agree to be stolen from to avoid contraversy.\n\n&gt; I'm not at all. I just personally think birth control shouldn't be addressed until the conditions that kill people are\n\nLike pregnancy?\n\nWhat you really mean is \"conditions that kill men\"."

"&gt;Access to free contraceptives reduces abortion rates, reduces teen pregnancy rates, reduces high school drop-out rates, improves women's economic status, and the status of their children, which in the long run is the biggest fish to fry.\n\nIs the only way to provide free/low cost birth control through federal government health care reform? And it still isn't the biggest fish to fry in my opinion. Making sure people who need medical coverage to survive and not die or go bankrupt can get coverage is my biggest fish. I see the birth control coverage today as a possibly large impediment to that politically. And to me I'm ok with pushing that back until it's a smaller issue.\n\n&gt;Relying on condoms means relying on men to be active partners in birth control.  Sorry to break your bubble but the men are the weak link.  That's why funding birth control pills is a big deal.  Women know that works, so they can be intimate with a man even if he's unwilling to use condoms. \n\nSo disease prevention shouldn't be helped? Are you really saying government should pay for it because men are dumb? And you really think there aren't women who skip it/don't use it right? That's one hell of a naive argument.

There as political pressure there to accept him as an asylant regardless of the issues, however, a much better solution revealed itself rather quickly.\n\nAnd protests actually started, but stopped when it became appearant that the extend of of involvement was rather harmless, at least based on the facts given to us; the Meta data provided can hardly be compared to the full extend of what the NSA did and the only other involvement iirc was five eyes, where no real in depth information about the exact involvement of germany can be made thus far. While these actions are frowned upon they were mostly covered by existing agreements (cold war structure woopwoop) and theres nothing indicating that the purpose was solely to ensure national security without actually really violating the privacy of german citizens (alltho there may be reveals coming up regarding involvement in five eyes that may shed a new light on this) which is certianly nothing one can say about the NSAs actions.\n\nAnd nothing will change without vocal protests. You have two parties, both can equally be blamed for this situation, yet both cant lose their head over it because theres no real alternative and both have absolutely no reason to change the current situation other than making it secret again.

"&gt;The costs of unwanted pregnancies on our society are far, far greater than a couple of birth control pills.  Our society owes it to itself to ensure that if a woman does not want to get pregnant, she won't (inasmuch as our medical technology will allow).\n\nAnd we do. Many many place you can already get extremely cheap or free birth control without this bill. So why jeopardize the whole thing over it. I don't mean to say it's not a big issue, simply it's not an issue we can't already deal with. \n\n&gt;That is the argument.  There is no adequate retort to this argument, other than \"an imaginary guy in a book written three hundred and fifty years after his imaginary death is being interpreted by a bunch of old crotchety fucks [who died five hundred years ago] as having said it's immoral, even though he never actually said that, and there's no real passage in said book which says it, either.\"\n\nThat's not the argument at all, the argument is the government can't regulate religion and this does. I don't agree but it's a hell of a lot more compelling that yours. \n\n&gt;The cost argument is pointless.  Paying for birth control reduces insurance costs by ten thousand-fold.\n\nAnd healthcare reform is the only way to pay for it? \n\n&gt;The moral argument is pointless.  You're not allowed to instill your religion on others in this country\n\nAnd this is exactly why it may get struck down. The government is installing it's morality on religion. Which I don't know if it can legally do. It's a two way street. \n\n&gt;The \"it's my tax money\" argument is pointless.  You're not allowed to direct your tax money.\n\nCorrect, but you can sure as hell vote in people who will spend your tax money elsewhere and that's what I'm afraid of in this whole issue. I don't want birth control to be used to help elect people who will cut welfare etc etc. The cost of non-federal governments/outside groups helping is a lot lower than that. \n\n&gt;The \"it's cheap, pay for it yourself\" argument is pointless.  It's \"cheap\" to whoever makes this argument because they are not fucking poor, and probably have no concept of what poor is.\n\nI disagree, at it's cheapest you could afford it even on government assistance. Birth control isn't $450 a week like some other medication. And if the issue is simply those who are poor, well let's all get together privately and fund birth control for them. That way it's covered *and* we aren't risking healthcare reform in general/worse things in elections. \n\n&gt;We can't stop cancer [yet], but birth control is pretty fucking easy.  Not to mention, it has numerous beneficial side-effects unrelated to pregnancy. \n\nYou support my idea then, birth control is so easy we can get it done without the government and push this whole issue off for a few years when it's not an issue. Until then the complicated expensive ones can be dealt with by the government because the people can't deal with $30,000 a year health care costs for some diseases. \n\nIt's so easy is the whole point. It's basically the smallest problem we can have and people are willing to throw all sorts of other more complicated issues into the fire to defend it.\n\n"

"&gt; But is it not true that true democracies, such as you desire, have such a short lifespan?\n\nThe US is a simple majority. Its only been recently that more than 60 votes were needed in the US Senate due to filibustering. \n\n&gt;And is it not true that the Republicans have not held a supermajority since 1933? So it's not like the Republicans have been running ramshod through the state imposing their agenda on everyone.\n\nRepublicans didn't need a supermajority, they just needed enough seats to make sure the democrats didn't have one. This allowed them to steer a lot of legislation more to their liking.\n\nThe US is a representative democracy, which basically means majority rules (for the most part). So while attention should be paid the the minority party, the people have spoken and don't want the minor party ideas to be enacted. This is what elections are for. The republicans don't like this and have used everything they could to muddy the waters and make things difficult to pass legislation.\n\n&gt; I think that is what the Democrats are doing now in the state of California and U.S. senate in Washington D.C.\n\nIn Washington Obama is the best republican president of all time. The ACA is a republican idea. Most of Obama's decisions are former republican ideas that were rejected a number of years ago. So we are not looking at progressive democratic policies in action at all. It really is funny when people think Obama is some leftist when his policies clearly show he is not even close.\n\nAs for California, I think Jerry Brown is far far far better than Arnie was.

"&gt;The weird thing in this case is that Fugate was trying to convince Congress not to undo what it had just done. The 2012 law Congress passed — the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act — instructed FEMA to charge more realistic insurance rates that are in keeping with the rates private companies would charge. Congress said, in effect, \"It's OK to stop subsidizing those policies.\"\n\n&gt;So FEMA did just that. In 2013, it began phasing in higher premiums — mostly for second homes and for properties that have changed hands since then. In some cases, premiums went up by thousands of dollars.\n\n&gt;Right away, the phones in Congress started ringing — ringing so much so that Congress called Fugate in to demand a stop to the very law it had passed. Among the most outraged was Maxine Waters — the co-sponsor of the Biggert-Water's Act. At the hearing, Waters described her law as \"well-meaning,\" and then scolded Fugate for not coming to Congress earlier to explain just how high the premium increases would go (though they were specifically called for in the Biggert-Waters Act).\n\nSo congress passed a law and then when people complained that they were negatively affected by it they started blaming the people who were legally obliged to implement the law rather than the ones who wrote and voted for it (i.e. themselves).\n\nThe two solutions I see are either stopping government subsidized insurances and have the invisible hand of the free market ruthlessly sort things out or figure out exactly how the general public benefits from people living in flood plains and then tax the people who benefit the most to finance the insurance."

Mandela affirmed this, the Egyptians, who demonstrated the power of nonviolence, showed that it was possible, and promptly closed it off, while the rest of the world did exactly the same things. Now the progressives who should see this better are fixated on the Snowden affair and NSA watching metadata, jumping the gun on open doors while closing the door to the possibility of nonviolence. But nothing jumps the gun, at a conceptual level, more than the concept of \"evil\" (\"Gandhi and King are idealists, but there is evil in the world!\" -- Obama, Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech). The Left seethes with this concept every bit as much as the Right and the Hawks; they just do it in an oppositional form, but the remain blind to the opening of possibility that is required for true nonviolence. \n\nIf the conversation were to turn to a serious reckoning with the only real game changer in the Middle East, nonviolence-based revolution, the NSA would have far less to do. As it stands, terrorism is working out to be a perfect dance partner for security enterprises. As the NSA is worked out to be the next bad guy, the next \"evil\", as you put it, the whole struggle tumbles down the real slipper slope: of the ignoring of nonviolence, which *begins first and foremost by refusing to call \"evil\"*, to resort to this vapid characterization that is on the order of referring to the molecules in air as \"dark ether\" or something. \n\nNSA spying is not even the prequel to Nazi-style oppression; it is a response to Nazi-style terrorism, which is actual in the form it takes in many fundamentalist/extremist quarters. The doors of Guantanamo (and it should be noted that many released prisoners from there have gone on to kill) slam with the same logic of \"closing the door on evil before it happens\" that predominates. Does this mean just leaving the doors open? No, it means leaving possibility open while other, critical things (namely, nonviolence) are pursued. As it stands, the struggle over these doors goes nowhere precisely because those on the other side (the NSA) already know they aren't proto-Nazis. You say they are. And want to close the door. I say, you're a door-closer and are mismanaging possibility in a polemical form fueled by the concept of \"evil\", setting the stage for these intractable problems and closing the door to the the pursuit of the only real game changer \"on the table\" (but not really on the table): nonviolence. \n\nAs progressives expend all this energy on skirmish lines, just as Occupiers trumped up mini-struggles with cops as a replacement for real change, the system churns on, feeding into the great retribution-capitalism complex that even the concepts of the \"military-industrial complex\" and the \"prison-industrial complex\" can not begin to capture in essence and which are in fact wielded as stand-ins for the determination of \"evil\". Opponents know they are not \"evil\". Even terrorists know they are not \"evil\". As difficult as it may be to find the common humanity with those are bent on killing and forcing others into their way of thinking and living, what is abundantly clear is that counterforce, particular in the form of the determination that these others are beyond the pale of humanity itself, that is, that they are \"*evil*\", does not work and ultimately is not even true. \n\nDo not think that the question of possibility and the closing of doors in the face of a supposed, oncoming Nazi-like menace doesn't portend its own Nazi-like result. The sanctions in Iraq are a stunning example of just this, with 500,000 children dead (\"the price is worth it\" -- Sec. of State Madeline Albright), up to 1.5 million in total, and these being among the *most vulnerable in the population*. Yet just as approaches of increment and preemption lead to stances which, for their part, still strangely seem to fail to grasp the importance of nonviolence, understood in a deep, fundamental sense, and not just as maneuvering in a diversity of tactics, the fact is that the management of possibility itself can not be made to do double duty for the independent matter of nonviolence. That is to say, in short, that possibilizing can be very violent indeed, and can even take the form of a kind of violence itself (*possiblence*) when wielded deliberately in order to cause harm or force others in one way or another. One can see this throughout things like Guantanamo and the prisons, of course. And the sanctions. But this becomes part of the \"soft\" violence of the Left as well.\n\nIn a released thinking and action (thoughtaction) of nonviolence, possibility must still be variously managed, of course. The problem of terrorism or state overreach is not solved by freeing of possibility to greater realization *as possibility*. Allowing for instances of possibility's actualization (terrorism, oppressive state prosecution and intimidation) is no solution, to be sure. And the inherent, dominant capitalism that drives much of the management of possibility today is not interested in this other, seemingly unrelated category of thought and action: nonviolence. It doesn't even see the relationship between the status of nonviolence and what happens in possibilizing. Maybe it never can. But *we* can, and there is nothing more needful to do today than this freeing of nonviolence into its needful role on the table along with truth and possibility, thought and action."

"Part I\n\nBullshit. It's not a fucking prequel to anything but sniffing out possible terrorism. Done with too much of a hard on? At times, I'm sure, but the real danger here is the very logic of \"opening the door\", the \"that's where it starts\" idea, that something that looks like the \"start\" of something *is* that thing, as Michael Moore recently suggested in his talk with Amy Goodman *et al* (wherever that was). \n\nThe issue is whether this idea of \"opening the door\" in fact *does* count for whatever we slippery slope we wish to decide it really \"amounts to\" or is \"almost certainly\" paving the way towards. Which is not different from, but of a piece of, Bush's idea that Iraq had WMD's. \n\nMeanwhile, when the door is blown wide open, what happens? Look at the sanctions on Iraq and the death counts, dwarfing most mortality accounts of the whole US Iraq relation from Iraq war I through Iraq war II. Yet these, strangely, haven't registered so much. Why? \n\nBecause fixating on \"open doors\" and \"what probably will be\", like the hyped up promise of Occupy, is all of a piece with *capitalizing society*. Capitalism capitalizes on things, in this case, on these open door, trumping them up to amount to more than they are. Which means, ultimately, foisting illusions to *buy, buy, buy*, feeding back into the great purchases of dominant culture: retributive justice and materialism. \n\nThe problem with seeing \"opening the door to 'evil'\" (you seem to have GWB and Obama as your model here) is that it preemptively (see: GWB) takes as *being* something that is not yet and may not be. \"Well, we certainly can't wait for that to actually happen, can we?\", one might reply. The answer is, yes, we can and in fact must wait for things to happen. As terrible as a real terrorist attack is, one of the necessities of a world in which there is terrorism is that to some extent we must remain open to, and at times suffer from, terrorist attacks. Not because that's a good thing, but it comes from embracing the fact that we are vulnerable in the world; we must be boldly vulnerable to both terrorist attacks and security surveillance. If we place possibility up to high, we begin to commandeer reality by preemptively controlling everything. We have to get closer to actual moves to take over houses, imprison, etc., whether we like it or not, because possibility is not actuality. When we take the possible as actual, when we decide that that door does open to evil -- and it is no coincidence that these two are used together -- we are mastering truth too much and settling too much on illusion at the expense of reality. \n\nWhy does the concept of \"evil\" play into this? The idea of \"evil\" truncates out the inner truth of the thing (the threat); those determined to be \"evil\" are devoid of actual human circumstances. They are, rather, like a kind of terrifying blob to be destroyed, preemptively, if possible. The idea of evil gives up cause and effect for illusion, *just like the retributive justice that predominates everywhere*, and *just like the desiring consumption of materialist culture*, all without going through the work of asking whether something is *really* what it *seems* to be. Capitalism capitalizes on that space and time before the \"really\", before critical review. It views open doors as a place to get a foot in the door, to sell something, whether it's the idea that a threat is \"evil\" or that a nice thing \"brings happiness\". It pawns off all sorts of related illusions: that people who are punished are \"sorry\", that compliance based on threat is real social responsibility and concern, that people who are made to suffer really feel our pain through that suffering. \n\nIf we *let doors open*, we allow possibility to happen, pending our critical review, our saying \"really?\", our entering into things more to work out what is really going on. If we slam the doors shut, we capitalize on possibility in the same way that the concept of \"evil\" capitalizes on the threat to work up the idea of a monster. Then we live in a world of monsters and heros, but little truth. Guantanamo, one of the uttermost results of this, and certainly much of the criminal justice system, but also the great marketplaces selling us things we don't need, getting us to buy things without asking \"do I really need this?\", all are rooted in the idea of the open door. \n\nThe solution to open doors is not closing them, which just opens the door to closing them all the time, but to leaving them open and understanding them to be part of the world of possibility. Entering that world more seriously can then work out real solutions, some of which are security practices that work, but also working out real change to persistent problems. This means working out alternatives to the greatest door closing of all, the military strike, in favor of what *really* works (nonviolence-based revolution). But nonviolence-based revolution is precisely what is based on a more open and rich kind of possibilizing. Why do you think it is so poorly understood and so poorly recognized? Because of all the precipitous door-closing everywhere."

"&gt;&gt;I still don't get it. \n&gt;Well, if nothing else, I hope we agree that the Fourth Amendment jurisprudence — which ensures the rights of the INDIVIDUAL — really ought to be construed against the government, rather than against the public. \n\nI think I more or less agree, although I also think the Constitution is unfortunately more polarizing than ideal in how it helps set up a \"government vs people\" conflict. It seems the idea of government as civil service with the purpose of public welfare was kind of new at the time, so they were thinking about restraining autocrats more than keeping democratic governments on the level.\n\n&gt;&gt;e.g., I think allowing government officials to \"ask\" anyone else to produce information about you with no restriction is a bad loophole)\n&gt;It's not a \"loophole.\" The government leveraging third-parties to spy on you on its behalf is no different than the government using its own agents to spy on you. The identity of the agent doesn't alter the fundamental nature of the crime.\n\nI think we're in complete agreement on that one.\n\n&gt;Again, there's a simple solution, within a simple question: Did the government have the opportunity to obtain a sworn, particularized warrant enabling that search (including any third-party searches)? \n&gt;\n&gt;If they did, but couldn't be bothered to secure the warrant as the Constitution requires (the Constitution being the supreme law of the land), the evidence was thus obtained illegally, therefore it's — at a minimum — inadmissible in any legal proceeding.\n\nI will continue to insist that those rules are not contained in the text of the Fourth Amendment themselves. They do seem reasonable. But isn't that similar to how it works in practice? I thought the exceptions were for things like immediate pursuit. I guess you are talking about creating a bright line rule...it might be good but it's hard to see all the consequences.\n"

"I am not a political scientist by any stretch, but here are quick thoughts as an American (I'm assuming you aren't? Sorry if I'm wrong).\n\nFirst: delegation, basically. America is really, really fucking big. One single entity could not control every aspect of law and order in a place so big. Starting at even town- or city-level, slightly different decisions are made for slightly different communities. Build that up to counties, and states, and that's just the way it has to be to work. We have a lot of different cultures over a very big area, so a lot of decisions have to be made at a state level.\n\nSecondly: history. We are the United States of America, after all. We started as a union, a group, a collection of little quasi-countries, if you will. That legacy continues.\n\nHowever, in this day and age with technology of instant communication and rapid transport and travel, a lot of what I just said may quickly become an irrelevant artifact. It's a very murky question: Are you an American or are you a [insert state citizenship here]? Depending on where you go in America, you might get a different answer.\n\nBut we are big and connected enough that major decisions need to (and should, in my opinion) be federally (nationally) regulated. For example, I can call or Skype with someone on the other side of the world instantaneously, or fly and see them in person in a day, but if I happen to be gay my marriage is null and void when I cross a somewhat arbitrary state line? That's a weird disjunct, but that's also civilization and politics. It's a little weird, and I see some kind of a tipping point for a lot of issues in America in the near future where state/federal rights are concerned.\n\nAmerica has a strong history of \"state's rights\" and \"limited government.\" That line is starting to blur, such as what IS an individual right, state's rights, or federal power? It's becoming a murky issue but with our legacy of state's right for delegation and organization, that also gives them a lot of other powers, such as potentially being able to deny a federal law in some cases. Whether that can continue into the future with the globalization and inter-connectedness of, well, everything, I hope someone else has a more informative post than mine."

"I don't live in a town, so I can't give you precise numbers on rent, utilities etc. (I'm in a large, expensive city which I imagine would be higher than the numbers you gave for your town). However, to compare your reference points, I can get a pizza at my local joint for about $7, a Big Mac for about $3.50, and GTA V for $40 off Amazon. We tend to sell milk in different units from yours (and I never buy the lactose‐free varieties), but a gallon of milk can go for about $2.50, which works out to $0.65 per liter. Gas is also sold by the gallon and varies widely by region. The last time I filled up I paid about $3.50 per gallon (which will surprise people in New York and California, no doubt). Per liter that's about $0.91. I don't smoke, so I can't really tell you the price on those, sorry. The prices I've mentioned generally don't include tax (gas does though). Thing is, the majority of states have no sales tax for food and medicine. But if you were unlucky enough to live in one that did, I'd estimate about 5-7% for that. Online sales almost never have tax (so Amazon doesn't add anything to the GTA V price).\n\nConversions:  \nPizza: $7 → 45 SEK  \nBig Mac: $3.50 → 22.54 SEK  \nGTA V: $40 → 258 SEK  \nMilk: $0.65 → 4.19 SEK  \nGas: $0.91 → 5.86 SEK"

"Yet here you are typing away on the Internet. Started and funded by DARPA, a U.S. funding agency. Now, please go on again about how everything the government has ever done is a complete failure.\n\n&gt;This morning I was awoken by my alarm clock powered by electricity generated by the public power monopoly regulated by the U.S. Department of Energy.\n\n&gt;I then took a shower in the clean water provided by a municipal water utility.\n\n&gt;After that, I turned on the TV to one of the FCC-regulated channels to see what the National Weather Service of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration determined the weather was going to be like, using satellites designed, built, and launched by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\n\n&gt;I watched this while eating my breakfast of U.S. Department of Agriculture-inspected food and taking the drugs which have been determined as safe by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\n&gt;At the appropriate time, as regulated by the U.S. Congress and kept accurate by the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the U.S. Naval Observatory, I get into my National Highway Traffic Safety Administration-approved automobile and set out to work on the roads build by the local, state, and federal Departments of Transportation, possibly stopping to purchase additional fuel of a quality level determined by the Environmental Protection Agency, using legal tender issued by the Federal Reserve Bank.\n\n&gt;On the way out the door I deposit any mail I have to be sent out via the U.S. Postal Service and drop the kids off at the public school.\n\n&gt;After spending another day not being maimed or killed at work thanks to the workplace regulations imposed by the Department of Labor and the Occupational Safety and Health administration, enjoying another two meals which again do not kill me because of the USDA, I drive my NHTSA car back home on the DOT roads, to my house which has not burned down in my absence because of the state and local building codes and Fire Marshal's inspection, and which has not been plundered of all its valuables thanks to the local police department.\n\n&gt;And then I log on to the internet -- which was developed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Administration -- and post on Freerepublic.com and Fox News forums about how SOCIALISM in medicine is BAD because the government can't do anything right."
"No, I'm not saying the government should pay for it because men are dumb.  Those are your words, and you saying that and then telling me I sound like a sexist is a rather overt form of self-deception on your part.\n\nYes, some women will not use effective contraceptives even if the contraceptives are free.  We don't create public policy only if it is 100% effective for 100% of the people.  We enact public policy if the benefits out-weigh the costs, and we enact federal public policy when the issue is large and the various states cannot align on good policy.  \n\nThere is a cost incurred today by those who use contraceptives, and that cost likely goes down if the coverage is universal, especially under ACA where there is a medical loss ratio provision.  There is also a cost when people don't use contraceptives that they would have used if it were fewer barriers to access.  When not using contraceptives leads to teen pregnancy and child-raising, the economic costs to the woman, to the child, and to society are huge.\n\nThinking that if you wait and it will then be a smaller issue is hopeful thinking.  The far right anti-women agenda is not going to drift off into the sunset any time soon.  Anyone who believes that should review the anti-abortion agenda in Virginia and recall how the soon-to-be-ex-governor said he would not push a social agenda and distanced himself from his misogynistic master's thesis in 2009, only to support mandated state-sponsored rape for women seeking abortion in 2012.\n\nLook, I've been thinking through these issues for 25 years.  I have 3 teen age daughters and my wife has done research and community interventions designed to reduce teen pregnancy and increase use of condoms.  I hear you when you say you're OK with pushing back on this issue.  All I am saying in reply is that telling others that their issue is getting in the way is ignoring the magnitude of the issue and the length of time that this issue has been here.  It comes across as telling them to be happy sitting at the back of the bus -- again."
"&gt; I suspect no matter how much I scream at you, you won't admit to killing Kennedy, if you do, you are weak willed. \n\nLol, screaming != being in jail for 20 years.\n\n&gt; Ahh the goto card again. Have anything else in that deck, because I have yet to hear anything other than excuses and well, excuses.\n\nBecause you are, literally, a white supremacist. You use the same arguments that white supremacists use: you claim that you aren't racist, but it's just \"statistics\" (a laughable example since statistics don't actually back you up in you use your weird interpretation of that), \"race card\", and spelling racist \"raciss\" in order to make fun of your fucked up view of black people.\n\n&gt; Yes, the lack of fathers that started in 60's, and the drug war that started in the mid 80's.. is there nothing your excuse deck can't dismiss.\n\nNo, mass incarceration of African Americans only start happening in the 80s with the drug war.\n\n&gt; Because statistically they are. This is of course not true for everyone, but you, nor I, nor the cops, nor anyone work on an individual basis. Not all pitbulls are violent, but I'd bet you wouldn't risk your kid with one you didn't know. That is known as common sense, and you are kidding yourself if you think that that doesn't apply to people as well.\n\nWow, very subtle comparing black people to dogs there. (Also a hilariously wrong analogy, pitbulls are some of the sweetest dogs around).\n\n&gt; Only because there are lies, damn lies and statistics.. \n\nSeriously? Aren't you claiming your whole argument based on \"statistics\"?\n\n&gt; The drug war, and drugs, is an ever sifting metric. However, as long as it is a \"status\" of being cool, it won't. Anymore that swearing, or spitting, or drinking underage. However, and again, that doesn't change why there are more black youth caught up in the drug crime than others. If you do it on a street corner (Including swearing, spitting, scratching nuts, etc) more people will notice than if you do it in your home... Why is this so hard to see? Afraid, you'll have to go to your nearest mirror and start to scream racist at your reflection for acknowledging the truth?\n\nExcept it's not true at all. Black dealers are no more likely to sell in the streets than white people.\n\n&gt; Because even if statisticly for drugs they aren't at a higher percentage, they are for all violent crimes, weapons, assult, rapes, and, and, and, and... and worse, even those blacks that try and point this out (like Cosby ) get vilified by the same blacks that are hurting their peers - just as you are.\n\nControlling for joblessness, black people are no more violent than anyone else.\n\n&gt; And what does that tell you? Since when is one or two priors, not grounds for suspension? If Bob Smith only attacked your sister once or twice, I am guessing (Na, I know) when the third time your sister is attacked you will make a bee line right to Bob Smith ... because you are a semi intelligent animal(Despite what you are trying to portray here so you can pat yourself on the back for being \"enlightened\" at the expense of other people).\n\nYeah, that's totally a reasonable response to smoking weed. Have you ever smoked weed?\n\n&gt; Oh my freaking god.. you mean they would have to live like the rest of humanity? Ohh the ...ahh...humanity?\n\nOh, the rest of humanity lives on the streets? News to me.\n\n&gt; They don't. they have to live up to the standards that all people have (Which means no priors), and that becomes hard when people give them excuses and forgive each and every fucked up action they do because it has to be someone elses fault.\n\nHaving a daughter who smokes weed off property and gets caught is a fucked up action apparently.\n\n&gt; That is what happens when you live under someone elses dime. Didn't your parents ever teach you \"Under my house, you are under my rules\"? Again - this in known as being a grown up.\n\nSeriously? You think that a mother should be punished because *her daughter smoked weed?* And she should be *homeless* because of this? You're fucking delusional.\n\n&gt; At the risk of repeating myself - grow up.\n\nJust curious, how old are you?\n\n&gt; but I know, I know Statistics be racisis yo...\n\nAh, the sweet tears of white supremacists.\n\n&gt; No, it means accepting the truth born out of statistics, common sense and observable reality - something you seem to be unwilling to do. I know, it is because the system is racist... Because lets face it, that is easier than accepting responsibility for your own actions..\n\nYou have a strange interpretation of observable reality. Your attitude is a perfect example of the kind of attitude that supports these systems of racial injustice.\n\n&gt; Your type of social justice has hurt the black community\n\nHow?\n\n&gt; condemned more black youth to poverty\n\nCitation very very much needed since this is pretty much the opposite of reality.\n\n&gt; and yet still you have the audacity to think it is me being racist because I dare speak the truth? \n\nAh yes.

He knew that even passing the bill that did squeak by was going to be tough, let alone up-ending the system entirely and going with a single-payer system.  There were already rumblings about socialism this and socialism that from the right-wing loons, so there were essentially no chance a single-payer system would have gotten off the ground.  Instead, ObamaCare needs to be seen for what it is - the first (big) step in moving toward a single-payer system.  ObamaCare needs to be seen as other momentous pieces of legislation, such as Social Security.  When SS was first implemented, it wasn't anywhere near the system that we have in place today that keeps millions of seniors out of poverty.  \n\nVermont is paving the way for moving even farther than ObamaCare by offering a single-payer system, and it will be interesting to seeing how that works out, but we wouldn't even be talking about single-payer today, if ObamaCare didn't lead the way first.  ObamaCare sets limits to insurance company profits.  It forces a minimum level of coverage, and also demands that pre-existing conditions, as well as stuff like birth control be covered.  Those are all HUGE moves that the industry was shockingly allowed to do as they wanted in years past.  "

"Using a *Special Weapons And Tactics\"* or *\"Emergency Response Team\"* to respond to what you described as an \"active shooter\" scenario is one thing, but using them to execute search warrants or make arrests against non-violent offenders (as is far too commonly the case) is something else entirely. Unfortunately, police SWAT/ERT units are used far too often nowadays to respond to incidents or make arrests that have nothing in the way of evidence to suggest that kind of firepower or violence of takedown is required. One of the big reasons a lot of police forces use these units with such regularity, even when it is not called for, is because of both the intimidation factor, as well as it allows the force to better justify the massive expense required to outfit and maintain these types of military-tactic units. Simply put, the more they use them, the easier it is to justify their existence, and the reasoning does not seem to matter much.\n\nThe big problem, especially in smaller jurisdictions, is that, thanks to the federal post-9/11 anti-terrorist money that has flowed in, many of these units have some seriously high-end gear available to them, and that expense needs to be justified, so they use these teams all the time against non-violent citizen suspects, even when that level of firepower or equipment (armored personnel carriers for example) is not remotely required to safely and expediently effect a lawful arrest or serve a warrant. In many cases, even though they have the gear, the SWAT/ERT officers do not have the proper specialized training required, and it results in some seriously sad gung-ho shit happening."

In the end, they took it out to appease people like Olympia Snowe, but then they got ZERO Republican votes for the plan anyway.\n\nHad it been considered, maybe it would have passed. It did, after all, have public support."
"That depends entirely on how you define \"unreasonable\". I consider anal cavity searches \"unreasonable\", but somehow our government disagrees. Same goes for electronic data.

"Okay, let me teach you something about **the real world.** Because I asked for **empirical evidence, not a load of bullshit rhetoric**\n\n&gt; Well, we aren't talking about every other country on earth, we're talking about the US. Health care spending in the US is really silly. There are actually two systems (or more, depending on who you ask). When people say the US spends more for health care, they are largely referring to the \"private\" system, where in other countries this cost would be paid for in taxes. \n\nJust because the US is a different country doesn't mean that its \"regulations\" and that we can't compare them. If it was regulations, **every other country on earth would have the same problem.**\n\n&gt; Then you've got the regulations I mentioned above. For one, there's the certificate of need that literally allows competitors to determine whether or not they will allow other competitors into the market. Then there's the conservative bias of the FDA that costs companies significantly more to bring drugs (and many medical devices) to market, then at the same time gives those companies monopolies on the ability to sell the drug (more). There's also an upward effect on prices caused by government putting money into the health care system through Medicare and Medicaid; when Medicare was first enacted, government spending was near 0% but now it is around 50% and health care spending per capita has more than doubled.\n\n**I want my drugs checked by the FDA for quality control. I would like to know medical devices work and tests work. Once again, if your assertion were true it would be reflected in world-wide data. I am a scientist, I will not believe what you say on faith. I want evidence. Do you have it or not?**"

You were duped.\n\n&gt; Forcing women to pay for men's prescriptions then refusing to make men pay for women's drugs is theft.\n\nThe Catholic Church is agaisnt being forced to pay for insurance that covers male and female contraception (vasectomies etc..), so thats another strawman.\n\n"

"Cancelled insurance plans means nothing.  Most cancellations included an option to buy into a new plan.  Individual insurance plans are cancelled and renewed all the time (on average, once every 2 years).  You get a letter stating that plan X is ending or being replaced by plan Y.  Would you like to buy plan Y?  (Yes/No).  Individuals were under no obligation to purchase insurance through the exchanges.  The only plans that were cancelled that are of true concern were the plans where the insurer pulled out of the individual market altogether.  The number of those cancellations was very low as those companies did not have large market shares to begin with.  For instance, 9 companies pulled out of Nebraska's individual market.  Those 9 companies combined had less than 10% of the total individual market share for Nebraska.  Aetna and United pulled out of California's individual market.  However, they only had 60k combined individual market customers.  The California exchanges have enrolled over 400,000 individuals.  \n\nIn other words, the talking point is very weak and is designed to fool easily manipulated individuals, like Republicans.        "

You can argue it's necessary to go past the \"texualist\" approach, but that sets the presedence that a future court can do the exact same and rule the second amendment void, because they're deeming it necessary to go beyond the text itself.\n\nPersonally I find that approach more frightening than a narrow interpretation, especially when it comes to modern surveillance.  It's very easy say it's necessary to void even textually defined bits of the fourth. \n\n&gt; The point of my post is that the justices are going against, not reinterpreting it or using a different constitutional approach, but against the constitution directly to suit their various ideologies. \n\nAnd I respectfully disagree that this is what is happening.

"Again, they got no Republican votes for all their effort.  They could have pushed harder on getting Al Franken seated. They could have gone to budget reconciliation earlier. They could have quickly passed whatever they wanted instead of trying for a bipartisanship they didn't get.  They could have passed a simple Canada-style bill that just required the states to provide universal healthcare, and left it to them to work out the details.\n\nAnd no, they lost the midterm because the economy sucked. You're saying that dragging out the ACA passage, then barely passing it with some trickery after Kennedy died, somehow helped them?\n\n&gt; is it more likely they put it all on the line and got the best deal they could?\n\nI think Obama failed to recognize his opposition for what it was, and expected to get a few Republican votes.

"Never turn your back on a hippie. They'll cut you."
"You won't see either side support a single-payer system in the near future.  In fact, you won't see either side support anything that reduces healthcare or insurance costs.  \n\nThe reason is simple: The healthcare industry and its middlemen are *THE* industry in the U.S. It's what is keeping the economy here afloat.  It is the stinking shit-brick cornerstone supporting near everything else.  Depending on the year and who is reporting, healthcare and medical insurance expenditures make up 17% to 20% of the GDP.  Think about that; the entirety of defense spending, in all its bloated glory, makes up only 4.5%.\n\nWhen you look at it this way, it's easy to see why the ACA was so focused on increasing costs and spending rather than reducing them in any meaningful way.  No checks on service cost, mandatory insurance spending, requirements that insurance companies spend more...  All in a bid to keep that economy chugging.  Conversely, if congress got a hair up its ass and decided to reduce healthcare and insurance costs even by a measly 20%, well there's a 4% drop in the nation's production right there. "

"Ah, I totally misinterpreted your question, then. My bad.\n\nI don't know where I fall on this issue myself. I like that states can be \"individuals,\" so to speak, in certain ways.

Different states have different driving speeds on the roads. And many other things I can't think of right now (little bit of a hangover still).\n\nBut also, driving through another state should not be like entering a different country. And with some laws, it kind of is.

America just does it weirdly. I don't know how long that can continue in that way.\n\nSo, yeah, honestly, I don't know where I fall on the issue. It's great in that each state has the right and freedom and say in how things are run, but it's also bad because it creates a situation like \"OK, we all pay taxes and we're one great country and we're all in this together....except this state that takes more of this....this state gives more of this....this state allows this thing but others don't...this state that doesn't want that so any American citizen (of the ONE country) gets treated differently there....and...well shit...\" So I vacillate on the issue."

"You talk about how the NSA does damage. I was discussing how to actually provide a solution to what the NSA does. I went down this path because it's very similar to healthcare. If the people were empowered enough to force change on private companies then these issues would be resolved. But instead people point fingers at the government who is simply doing what it can by law. The law regarding the NSA's actions simply states the government can do what private companies. The simple solution to the NSA's issues (and going back to the original topic, healthcare) is making it so private companies stop doing the same exact damaging shit to the American public. I am sorry if that is over your head.\n\nPS - My axe is already ground. Time to swing it."

"Personally I think that states are sort of outdated. Or at the very least needs to be reorginazed. \n\nIf you remember, texas is the 2nd largest state in the union. Its huge. In gdp and in people and in economy. \n\nA few years ago, Texas decided to not teach evolution and teach creationism in their schools. So they ordered textbooks that didnt have origin of species, but had a detalied analysis of the Book of Genesis. \n\nSince it is such a huge market, text book makers make books for it. A state like rhode island isn't a big market, so unless they want text books that cost 100X as much, they must follow Texas' lead and thier choice of books. So Texas has much influece over the country because they are bigger than like 30 states combined. \n\nSame goes for California and their EPA. Cal-EPA and Cal-OSHA tells car makers how to make cars. A auto manufacturer wont make an assembly line to make cars for california and another assembly line for the rest of the country (Its easier and cheaper to make just one, and since california is 10% the USA economy, they make for california standards) \n\nSo if california demanded a 90% reduction of emissions, the rest of the country, with their shitty EPAs have no choice but to follow suit. \n\nSo, I would rather have a federal governmet make unioversal regulations and law, or regornize the states so that one state doesn't make up a huge part of the gdp.

Pregnancy can be expensive, but you take care of that by covering pregancy with your insurance policy, AND paying for birth control. That doens't mean you need to pay for birth control with your isnurance.\n\nRoutine maintenance is simple and out of pocket is cheap as long as you aren't stupid and insist on brand names and designer drugs like yaz.

"I too initially found it disappointing that the writer didn't manage to tell us which economists they were taking about.  \n\nI am fairly certain they refer to results from the [AP survey of economists](http://news.yahoo.com/ap-survey-us-income-gap-holding-back-economy-170643637--finance.html). The survey included economists from private industry and the article quotes two of them including the chief economist from Raymond James.  \n\nHowever I want to hear not only some sheer number of economists, but more their analysis including market mechanics that explain this, and not \"there is this high correlation between income inequality and growth reduction.\"\n\nHere is this quote from an October [article in Bloomberg](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-08/gatsby-stays-on-farm-as-income-gap-limits-u-s-social-mobility.html):\n\n&gt; The mobility of workers versus their peers has also declined, threatening productivity, business profitability and economic growth, according to Wells Fargo Securities LLC’s chief economist John Silvia. While the ability to ascend income brackets still exists, the likelihood of a household jumping from poverty into wealth declined in the decade ended 2009.\n\nRegarding your valuable insight about the lack of a special culpability of wage stagnation as cause of slowdown: \n\n&gt; \"Granted we could have probably weathered the recession better if middle/lower class wages haven't stagnated for decades, but I don't see it as a significant culprit holding back our current recovery.\"\n\nI agree that it isn't low wages by itself that holds us back but rather a dropped core of output production re-investment that has left a hole in domestic manufacturing. \n\nThere are fundamental problems with raising domestic economic output that are concomitant with loss of mobility.  The 35% loss of domestic manufacturing jobs before the current recovery both reduced output and prevents people on the bottom from moving out of mass retail  and up into factory positions.\n \nIt took 5 presidents 24 years to add 8 million manufacturing jobs among the some 130 million we have to the economy.  Seven million of these jobs were gone in less than a decade from 2000 to 2009.    There was an attempt at a construction based recovery, but no migration of investment to industry.  Instead tax reductions were implemented that favored foreign investment by an administration who featured off-shoring as one of its favored programs.   \n\nThese policies steered investment away from industrial recovery and also broke the job ladder at the bottom rungs that so much of the spirit of this country has been built on.\n"

"The US has by far the best quality --  if people can afford it. And let's be clear, the vast majority of people have insurance and can afford it.

But the technology and treatments available are excellent.\n\nThat doesn't mean the cost isn't a problem, because it obviously is.

"&gt; Why is it bullshit to have a different opinion than Katz and Smith? \n\nI didn't say it was bullshit to have a different opinion than Katz and Smith, please do! [Smith and Katz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) put forth a rule/test to determine if something is afforded 4th amendment protections. Whether you agree with that protection or not, I DON'T CARE. It's not the right or wrong of the test or the interpretation, but a clear disregard for any type of standard in favor of what it is that they want the result to be that bothers me. The part you quoted, it was the \"actually applying the law\" as in the test, rather than some bullshit that mattered.\n\nExamples of this to me include my barn, open fields, bank records... all clearly pass the test and should be afforded protections. If my bank started giving out my information to people I'm certain I'd have a decent law suit on my hands. And I can trespass anyone off my land and use force to do it. Yet the court didn't extend protections, and reading those opinions they seem to merely say the answer is  \"no\" when it is very obviously \"yes\". \n\n&gt; Scalia is a prime example, if he went by his personal ideologies he would certainly not have allowed flag burning.\n\nPeople like to point out \"that one time scalia didn't screw up...\"  yet ignore all the other times he did. His opinions are some of the best examples of bias. When he uses his approach, fine, no issue. But he's just as quick to drop his approach as the rest of them when it matters most, and the burning of the flag? Yeah, didn't really matter. \n\n&gt; We've voted those people into office and like it or not, they're mostly doing what we've asked them to do. Note the sub 15% approval of the senate, but near-90% support of ones own senator.\n\nDoesn't speak to the point I was making.

"Lightly related:\n\nI always feel compelled to point out that -- during the 2008 primary battle against H. Clinton -- Mr. Obama consistently campaigned on health care reform that would not require a mandate to purchase coverage. I followed the primary very closely, and it was the only substantive difference in the platforms between Clinton and Obama. I mean that literally. On every single platform issue between the two, I only recall a divide on the mandate versus no mandate issue. For that reason, the primary debates were fairly boring.\n\nAfter Mr. Obama won the democratic endorsement and Presidency, he immediately switched positions and articulated that a mandate would be necessary to implement any insurance-based end to pre-existing condition exclusion. And of course that's true, which is why Clinton (who was the Democrat's only veteran on the issue of universal health care reform) supported it from the beginning.\n\nIn other words, I have always believed that Mr. Obama's position on the mandate issue was specifically designed to mollify critics who worried about \"mandated\" insurance coverage, notwithstanding that Mr. Obama and his team must have known that a mandate would be required down the road. Take that for what you will.\n\n"

This was provided by fraternal societies all across america with no government intervention. These societies where based largely off of race, religion, and sex. The larges users of them where blacks, immigrants, and the poor.\n\nMany in the USA at the time viewed medical care as \"to available\" and \"to cheap\" and that the face that these societies where providing cheap medical care for individuals was \"bankrupting the medical profession\".\n\nMedical societies like the AMA even proposed sanctions on doctors who worked in the fraternal societies and where given huge government grants to accomplish crushing them. After a while they where very much successful.\n\nI don't understand how people continue to think government is the answer when time and time again throughout history it has proven to do nothing more that fuck things up, blame it on something or someone else, then claim it has the solution.\n\n"

"The ACA is trying to fix something structurally broken - the american health care system.  My wife recently had surgery, and at first health insurance refused to cover because we had not yet re-affirmed that we didn't have health insurance through another employer.  So the bill was initially 32K$.  Then when insurance covered, it went down to 16K$.  Which of course reflects market forces on the cost of the services provided.\n\nSo I recently asked a chiropractor what the deal was with 'network' and why wasn't he in my insurer's 'network'.  He said the insurance companies determine how many of a given type of health care provider should exist within a certain physical area of a certain demographic.  Then they invited those types of providers to join their network until that predetermined quota is full.  Then as to how much they will pay for any given kind of health care service or product, they use something called the \"traditional cost\", which is what has been charged in the past for something, whether it's aspirin, bandaids, doctor's visit, etc., etc.  Which is why the prices are so high, in relation to preceding paragraph.  They are ok with giving a break or discount, but the actual price of health care is high chiefly because of how the health  care insurance industry operates.\n\nIn other words, we know what the problem is, and it's not sick people."

More than half of those with medical debt carry medical insurance, and those people actively avoid seeking further medical help because of their situation. Of those who go into bankruptcy due to medical expenses, which is the cause in more than 60% of personal bankruptcies and hits almost a million Americans every year, three fourths of them carry medical insurance.\n\nNo, the vast majority do not have the medical insurance needed to cover the costs of care in this country beyond basic care."

The improvements have been astronomical! I also love paying third party fees when I import something because US Customs outsourced distribution to a private companies.

It is ridiculous that police officer should need to go to a gun store and borrow weapons because they don't have the firepower to do their jobs.  A snub-nosed revolver will kill you, the average citizen, just as well as an AR-15, so you really need to stop playing on peoples' emotions. \n\n&gt; This switch has resulted in numerous innocent households being shot to hell,\n\nThe police don't just walk up and start spraying houses with bullets for no reason.

I hope I am being clear enough about that. Mistaken raise are the result of administrative failures, not the result of high-tech guns or armored vehicles. Warrants were carried out on wrong homes accidentally a hundred and fifty years ago. So, once again, stop being dishonest.\n\n&gt;They also have numerous armored assault vehicles.\n\nOh god! They have NUMEROUS trucks with big armor on them? The humanity! ***THEY HAVE ARMOR!*** Wait... why is this a problem, again? What's so bad about having a truck with armor on it? Oh, right, nothing -- it just allows you to try to make another emotional, fear-based argument.\n\n&gt;Your position is pedantic.\n\nNo, his position is common-sense. The police *are* quasi-military by definition. ***YOUR*** position is pedantic. Pedantic means something, not just \"I don't like your view!\" It is trivial to point out that police forces have a car with armor on them. That armor does nothing to hurt your freedoms, and to make the argument that it does is, y'know, *pedantic*."

"85% insured is considered a vast majority. Many developed countries that are considered to have universal health care, still only have 90-95% coverage. Our numbers aren't good, but their not terrible. And with it expected to jump to 90% by the end of the year! I would say were on the right track there.\n\nAs for quality being top notch, I think what is meant there is that we spend the most and use the largest volume of healthcare services of any country. Quality metrics are all over the place from country to country, but that a mostly because it's impossible to compare completely different cultures. If we have a much larger population eating terrible diets and not getting much exercise compared to the rest of the world, but then we have the best cardiac physicians and technology in the world to treat the problem, that doesn't mean well have better outcomes. Even if our care is better than anywhere else, the outcomes may still be worse. \n\nThe main reason people say care is better in the US is because we don't set limits. We are the only highly developed country that doesn't place a budget on medical expenses for a year. We have a culture of constantly treating and constantly doing tests to make sure you don't miss anything. That's what people like here, but they like it because it is our culture to like it. We created a system based on unlimited spending and unlimited usage, because that's who we are as a nation. So of course Americans believe they have the best system in the world.

You have a source for that, what case are you talking about?\n\nA few incidents come to mind with regard to the use of dispersants, [NYPD use of dispersants on peaceful protesters](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZ05rWx1pig) and a few in California (i.e., one in which [a UC-Davis campus police officer sprayed seated protesters (note the dispersant used)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AbYHRg3qlw) and one in which a veteran was struck in the head by a gas cannister).  The last time I checked, the right to assembly is a Constitutionally guaranteed right.  So, it was more than a little revolting to watch law enforcement violating the rights of Americans on behalf of financial industry weasels these people were protesting against.  "

"Lets stop pretending that the Canadian system is without problems.  I spent 15 years working for a Canadian owned company with a plant in the Detroit area and saw many examples of Canadian co-workers using our insurance because theirs wasn't up to snuff.\n\nOne example was a buddy of mine that had a serious back problem.  The pain was so great that he could barely move and was unable to do his job.  He was seen by a doctor in Canada and told that it would be months before he could have surgery.  He got on our insurance and was seen by a doctor and had surgery less than a week later.  \n\nThe Canadian system is great when compared to an American with no, or substandard insurance.  When compared to somebody with a better plan, it's not even close.  "

I don't give a shit if you're a Harvard graduate or a high school graduate, you should be able to get a job and not starve.  You keep grouping people into \"tries hard\" and \"doesn't try at all\" when those lines between people don't exist; there's only \"tries hard\" and \"tries harder,\" and neither should live on the street.\n\nThe idea behind society is that everybody should be improved by it, not that a few should benefit from it by being better than everyone else.  Your philosophy is, \"Fuck everybody who isn't me,\" and it wouldn't take long for the country to tear itself apart under such a maxim."
"Well, the one issue I have with that is that the uninsured raise the cost of insurance for those who do carry health insurance for themselves.

"The states with the lowest population density will always need more money than they give back, as will states with no major population centers (i.e. cities like LA, Houston, etc.). ~~That~~ They have weaker or smaller economies, and don't have the tax base to support things like an interstate highway system.\n\nBasically large states with low population densities will get more federal dollars than they receive. It's only happenstance that this correlates with them being red states, and that is due to the fact that rural populations tend to vote Republican. E.g., If you look at Colorado, Denver is really the only Democrat voting part of it. The rest of Colorado is mostly rural and they tend to vote Republican. It just so happens dense populations tend to vote Democrat, and rural populations tend to vote Republican.\n\nA great example that breaks the mold is Texas. They tend to vote Republican, but they are comparable to California in federal dollars received vs. taxes paid out. What's common between those two states is that they both are heavily populated and they both have robust economies. I.e. politics has little to do with how much Federal dollars they receive.\n\nNow, you could still argue some Republicans that advocate spending cuts and small government are hypocrites because their states receive lots of Federal money. Their states actually need the Feds to support their infrastructure, as well as other programs like agricultural subsidies, so it's hypocritical to denigrate every other program that their state doesn't need by calling it \"Big government hand outs\" or other nonsense.\n\nI did a comparison once between the 20 least populated states vs. the 20 states that have the highest ratio of federal dollars in / taxes out. Something like 18 states were common to both lists. I'll try to find it if I can."

"&gt; Do you think that public policy designed to fight climate change never contains emission targets or greenhouse gas concentration targets?\n\nOh, I know they do. You seem to think those standards are inadequate, so I'm asking what *your* standards are.\n\n&gt; My opinion is at a minimum based on numerical information you gave me. \n\nThe information I provided to you only said that CO2 emissions per capita have dropped significantly. From that you extrapolated that emissions levels were still rising, which is what gave you the opinion that we've failed or that we're not doing enough. That assumes that we're already passed the tipping point. You keep saying that you're not saying that, but that's exactly what you're saying. And I'm saying you have no factual basis to make that conclusion, so your opinion isn't based on any fact, and it's definitely not based on the facts I gave you. \n\n&gt; Yes, because you refuse to aknowledge that the word \"failure\" can legitimately be used outside a narrowly circumscribed domain.\n\nBecause the word \"failure\" has a definition. I learned from you that words and definitions matter. \"Failure\" is defined as a lack of success. I'm contesting your opinion because it's not true that there has been a lack of success on climate change as a result of liberal activism and legislation. I'm sorry that the dictionary is too narrowly circumscribed a domain for you. But like I said, if you just didn't use that word I'd probably agree with you that more could be done. I just know that we've made a lot of progress that wasn't a foregone conclusion, and I think your harsh criticism of the only people working on the problem is unfair, especially when you admittedly don't know the ultimate outcome.\n\n&gt; Why, so that later you can accuse me of changing the subject when in reality all I did was answer a question that you posed to me?\n\nNo, so you can back up  your statements with facts.\n\n&gt; You mean it can't have been a failure of Congress or the President? You mean it can't have been a failure of liberal pundits and journalists who influence public opinion and public policy? You mean it can't have been a failure of liberal citizens, whose attitudes comprise public opinion and who also influence public policy? You must mean these things, because this is what would be necessary in order to conclude that I could only have been talking about the EPA.\n\nI mean it's not yet a failure on anyone's part. There you go misusing that word again. \n\n&gt; I know that U.S. carbon emission continues to go up, because you told me so.\n\nActually I didn't, I just compared the peak output in the 70s to the output in 2012. I didn't compare 2013 to 2013, for instance, which would say whether or not it's continuing to go up. You came to that conclusion all by yourself. And even if I did give you the information that it continues to go up, which I didn't, then it still wouldn't necessarily follow that anybody has failed at anything. Again, a conclusion you came up to alone and without factual basis, which is the problem with your opinion in general. Your argument is actually sound, it just has no factual support.\n\n&gt; How do they work, exactly?\n\nBasically it burns waste to generate electricity. The way we transfer the heat into steam produces more electricity that we input to the heat source.\n\n&gt; I see a lot of sloganeering and very little facts, data, or evidence from you.\n\nI'm the only one in this conversation that's provided *any* facts. The statement you're responding to was about your own lack of action, so I don't know what facts or data you'd like me to cite regarding that.\n\n&gt; We could have negative carbon emission in the U.S.\n\nWe're well on the way to that goal. Your team is gaining 8 yards per play. Why are you calling anything a failure?\n\n&gt; What kind of answer are you looking for?\n\nI'd like to know how much CO2 is in the atmosphere (the score), how much CO2 the atmosphere can handle before global sea levels rise past the tipping point, and how much time (on the clock) you predict it will take the world to come to that point given the current emissions trends.\n\n&gt; Very little in life is definitive, let alone in public policy. Some people would regard insisting on definitiveness in policy to be silly.\n\nI like how you get all philosophical when you can't answer my question. That's very profound of you, and you're right very little in life is definitive. But we *generally* try to make public policy around facts. And by generally I mean all of the time, except when people try to outlaw contraception. The lack of scientific consensus is actually the reason more isn't being done on climate change related policy. It costs billions of dollars for energy producers to retool, and the EPA or any other government entity won't force them to make such an investment without the certainty that it will in fact help the environment. You want us to have a negative carbon footprint, but you're not telling me how businesses and the government can accomplish that goal. You're not telling me how much that costs or how long it will take. And you're not telling me how accomplishing that goal will affect global climate change. \n\n&gt; At a minimum, I analyzed the evidence that you gave me about U.S. carbon emission.\n\nYour analysis of the evidence I provided is incorrect.\n\n&gt; Congress? The President?\n\nNo and definitely no. Congress has much more influence than the President on their individual states, but they all rely on information provided by EPA. And EPA is the one that proposes standards and then enacts and enforces the policies. Congress and the President sit in Washington watching cable news, while EPA inspects plants.\n\n&gt; You mean the list I gave you when you asked me, \"how are we losing\"? I guess that would make this your tangent, now wouldin't it?\n\nYou didn't have to take it there though. I can think of 1,000 different ways of answering that question than making an exhaustive list of liberal failures. Or you could have ignored it to stay on topic. \n\n&gt; IF??? If my argument isn't anecdotal? Wait, earlier you said that it is anecdotal, now you're saying my argument may not be anecdotal? Why then did you say earlier that it is anecdotal?\n\nWell, admittedly your argument is quite confusing. It's all based on a fundamental misunderstanding of a piece of data I provided combined with a lot of assumptions you made all by yourself with absolutely *no* factual basis.  So I apologize if I can't categorize it properly. Calling it \"insane\" or something seemed mean. "

And notice how medical device companies didn't side with the ACA and suddenly got shafted with a tax much higher than what the insurance companies and pharmaceuticals got? They went along with ACA because they had to. It was not even remotely a hand out to them. Those who truly benefit from this law are the people. Millions of people.

No, it's not a conservative idea \"because it sucks,\" it's a conservative idea *because it was a conservative idea.*\n\nHeritage Foundation first proposed it back in 1989.  You don't have to take my - or any other \"liberal's\" word for it, you can still read all about it right on their own website:\n\nhttp://www.heritage.org/research/reports/1989/a-national-health-system-for-america"

"My opinion: The culprit is Neoliberalism. A slow but gradual paradigm shift has occurred over the last 70 years (accelerating mostly in the last 30). We've gone from allocating society's resources to providing benefits for public interests to allocating those resources for private interests. It's a worldwide phenomenon.\n\nIn developing countries, import substitution industrialization (a policy of building things locally to create jobs and grow the economy) was killed off when the IMF started mandating austerity in exchange for loans. \n\nIn North America, the golden age of Fordism (with good jobs, good salaries, good benefits and booming consumerism) was similarly killed due to a cocktail of factors: free trade and the loss of manufacturing, privatization and the downloading of socioeconomic responsibilities to lower tiers, deregulation and the emergence of new corporatism. \n\nWhy did all this crap happen? If you ask me, the fundamental flaw with capitalism is that it doesn't account well for externalities and human greed. Honestly, no system does. When you see folks on CNBC or Fox Business talk about the economy, they're doing so from within a bubble... conceiving of a perfect world where their model of capitalism is simple and predictable according to the guidelines they've set for themselves. The real world isn't like that.\n\nTake free trade for instance. Free trade works great on paper. By harnessing the power of comparative advantage, you can stand to gain a considerable overall surplus. If you make cars cheaper than I do, and I make coffee cheaper than you do, then let's focus on what we're good at and just trade with each other with no fees or tariffs. Of course, if we do this, my car manufacturers will have to go out of business and my land will have to be converted to mono-crops of coffee. This has costs. Mono-crops are ecologically fragile, the loss of manufacturing jobs entails the loss of economic linkages and spillover effects. People have to be dispossessed of their land, income and livelihoods.\n\nIn theory, if the winners of free trade compensate the losers, there should be enough surplus left over to make everyone happy. It just doesn't work out like that in real life. The winners never share the profits; they hold onto them. Why not? Well that's the nature of profit-driven corporations. Their only goal is to make profit. Why would they share? Hence, if you're going to have free trade, you're going to need to balance it out with some redistribution.\n\nFree trade is a good example of why the world has gotten richer overall but all that wealth continues to concentrate in the hands of a few while most people remain poor. The surplus of comparative advantage (free trade) has indeed generated new wealth, but the winners haven't compensated the losers.\n\nThis post is long so I'll wrap it up, but there are many other facets of neoliberalism at work here: privatization, deregulation, financialization, etc.\n\nWhat needs to be done? Stop neoliberalism. Vote. Demand democratic participatory budgeting. Educate. Reverse the commodification of education and research. School isn't just to help you get a job; It's about creating an informed citizenry that can responsibly participate in civic life and the democratic process.\n\nIt's a tall order, but I think it starts with education and participatory democracy. With time, we'll properly regulate trade, remove money from politics, and sensibly divide responsibilities between the public and private sectors."

It's extremely rare for soft bodied organisms to leave fossils that make it for &gt;500 million years for reasons that should be obvious.

"Since no one is challenging you on this: I will. Please explain?\n\nMy understanding is that a plutocracy is a system where the richest classes get to make the rules.

Again, people with money will always have influence and power.\n\nBut the actual writers of legislation, are chosen by the **PEOPLE**\n\nWhat percentage of blame goes to these **VOTERS** who keep electing year in year out the same people who they consider corrupt?\n\nI would say they deserve the majority of the blame. Because all I see from /r/politics is people who complain day in and day out. And just so that they never have to work for the change, they tell themselves, that these people they vote for have been chosen by the billionaires.\n\nSeriously, you actually believe that all the politicians in a state go to some political pageant and the billionaires pick out a few and say \"these are the ones the people will be able to vote for\"\n\n\nNo, the billionaires have the candidates they like and they give them money. These people run ads and get name recognition and media coverage.\n\nBut in the end, at every primary, the people get to vote. Even if every Billionaire in the country wanted candidate X to win, if no one voted for him, and voted for the other guy. Candidate X would not win.\n\n\nSo the real question becomes: who is forcing you to vote for Candidate X?\n\nGo to your primaries and vote for candidate Y, the guy who isn't corrupt.\n\n**STOP WAITING FOR SUPERMAN**"

They make the final call on if you are in the flood zone or not.   The fed maps are 1st grade quality so don't try to fight it yourself.   The surveyor around her will charge $600 for the survey and if you are in the flood zone they do not charge you.   Think about that business model.  It started after Katrina so i am sure the big floods have deemed this model."

Let's not forget, it's not the purchase of such weapons that poses the danger, it's the use of them that does.

Hardly it's exactly what happened with credit cards.  Only because the Fed and OCC already had regulatory authority nationally from 80+ years back was it not quite egregiously bad.

They have encouraged and assisted thousands of our slaves to leave their homes; and those who remain, have been incited by emissaries, books and pictures to servile insurrection.\n\n[...] A geographical line has been drawn across the Union, and all the States north of that line have united in the election of a man to the high office of President of the United States, whose opinions and purposes are hostile to slavery.

They still do, but the rate of increase is lower then it was, not so elsewhere.

"well, we're *all* speculating here so...\nI'm not from the UK, but I hear The Guardian is not as reputable as the NY Times. The Times would have LOOOVVED to get their hands on this info. I'd bet they'd run the story. Indeed, they would not have released some of the material, but we'd get a good picture of what was going on. I read the Times every day- do I believe every word of it? Well, of course not, but it's one of the best in the world and IMHO they have maintained a consistent level of excellent journalism as in the past. I saw an interview with Ellsberg on The PBS News Hour and indeed he was on Snowden's side. I happen to disagree with him on this one. If the Chinese can hack into our secure military servers, they'd be able to get all the info off of Snowden's computers- no question about it.Same with the Russians. I have no respect for the guy.

"What's funny to me is there's a lot of Americans that would rather have no insurance at all rather than have universal health care because they've bought in to the FUD spread by insurance companies (death panels, waiting lists, etc.).  U wut m8?"

"&gt; I included the legislative branch under the umbrella of public sector bureaucrats. Because they all share the same goal.\n\nLegislators specifically are not bureaucrats. They are supposed to represent you as a citizen.\n\nHowever, the majority of Republicans who actually voted to send our country into default do not seem to represent you or me or the interests of the people of this country very well at all. That doesn't mean they are bureaucrats.  \n\nIt means we're not able to do the job of electing representatives and that is due largely to state governments who are controlled by ALEC.   \n\nTotal votes for the House of Representatives in the State of North Carolina went to the Democrats by 50.9% 2.2 million to 2.1 million.  \n\nHowever, North Carolina is represented by 9 Republicans out of 13  and two thirds of these voted to send our country into default.  And this will get worse.  So ALEC and Art Pope will dictate that even more representatives would send our country into economic default.\n\n"
"But if both sides *are* crap?\n\nI don't see how pretending one side is significantly better just so you can feel politically relevant helps matters. There is no point in choosing a side until corruption is dealt with, so instead of going back home to one's abusive party and pretending you wont get beat again, we should be getting politically active towards a REAL goal. One that is borderline unachievable but at least isn't a lie.\n\n I was dormant because I had bounced around from party to party in my teens and later and got tired of being lied to. I knew that both sides were horrible because I stopped deceiving myself, then I did nothing, because there was nothing to do. All I could muster was some vague wish that Obama would have a change of heart and turn into a hero. Its only now in my mid-twenties that I'm struggling with ways to become an activist, not because I've bought into one party over the other but because I've finally found the will to abandon hope in them. The only hope I have left is that the rest of my up and coming generation abandon that faith as well, because its going to kill what of our country remains ours."
"&gt; You're assuming that it will be successful and popular.\n\nEvery feature of the law is already overwhelmingly popular when people are asked about it, with the exception of the individual mandate.\n\nImagine what would happen if a politician tried to single out any major provision of Obamacare and campaign against it.\n\n\"Insurance companies should be allowed to deny you coverage based on pre-existing conditions!\"\n\n\"Everyone should have a lifetime maximum that insurance is required to pay for your health care. After a million dollars, that's it - if you can't afford to spend more, you should die.\"\n\n\"Insurance companies should be allowed to offer plans with ridiculously high copays even for routine physicals and preventive care, discouraging people from catching treatable conditions earlier.\"\n\n\"The government shouldn't offer people subsidies to help them purchase insurance if they make more than enough to qualify for medicare but not enough to afford adequate coverage on their own.\"\n\nSee how ridiculous those ideas would sound if presented in isolation?\n\nThe only item that's unpopular is the individual mandate. However, the majority of the people who will be affected by this in a negative way will be young people, who don't vote anyway (sadly). The elderly are all covered by Medicare anyway, so it won't affect them personally - so they'll quickly forget about it, and it's unlikely to ever be a big issue.\n\nSo in practice, Obamacare is already popular - just not in name, and its important provisions have *already* been successful at eliminating the worst abuses of the for-profit insurance company.\n\nThe name \"Obamacare\" may never be popular, but it won't matter. The name \"Reagan\" is extremely popular, even though many of the things he did in office are actually quite unpopular now.\n\nWe took a step forwards. The expectations have changed. We will never again move backwards to a world with as much health care uncertainty that most people faced just two years ago. And thus we're much closer to single-payer.\n\n"
"&gt; Any move against the free market is ultimately detrimental to workers\n\nThis is anti-union propaganda.  The assumption any collective bargaining is harmful to the free market.  A totally unregulated free market leaves all power to those at the top.  Kind like a dictatorship.  \n\nWe tried the free market without unions and we got the worker abuse in coal mines, railroads, textile industries.  You name it.  We tried unions and things vastly improved and gave blue collar workers a decent and respectable quality of life.  We have now tried the anti-union message, and sadly, it has not worked out.  \n\nTLDR; Acting like any collective bargaining is detrimental to workers flies in the face of decades of evidence.  Abuse of collective bargaining is bad, not collective bargaining itself."

"Just because we haven't found the ancestor to trilobites yet doesn't create enough of a gap to invalidate the mountains of evidence that have been found in support of the theory.  The advancement from single-celled organisms to multi-cellular is still not very well understood outside of oxygen's part in the process.\n\nAs for your example of symbiotic relationships, it just goes to show that you don't understand evolution.  I can't really help you until you start to actually learn what the theory of evolution states.\n\nAs for your other gaps I'd love to hear them.  Generally it turns out the person claiming it is picking at what we have yet to learn and are generally unable to sustain their arguments with what we do know.  If everyone was right in that evolution is so easily overthrown I have always said for them to put the to the test.  Evolution is so easy to prove otherwise or at the very least to bring it into question, and anyone who did would be virtually guaranteed a Nobel Prize for doing so.  Yet everyone who declares that it's not real seem to only tout this to the less informed populace and not the forum in which it is truly understood."
"Why do we blame insurance companies so much when their actual profit margins are very small?  They're actuaries who run the numbers according to the rules of the game.  The rules of the game were messed up by allowing for things like denying coverage for pre-existing conditions, lifetime benefit limits, etc.  We have a further problem with the actual cost of healthcare, but that happens at the hospital level.  I really feel like the political debate is attempting to, and the pun is very intentional, treat a symptom rather than the disease (though the changes to some of the insurance rules were on point, which is why even Republicans often point to those as the parts of the ACA they would keep)."

"Um.. It isn't a fake health care website. It never claims to be the official sign up website. What it IS is a biased website giving information about the ACA. I can take issue with the OP's title.\n\nNote: the linked article is ALSO biased, albeit less so.

"Exactly. The majority of Democrats do support single-payer, but they needed every single Democratic vote to pass the bill.

If the 10 or 20 most liberal Republicans had actuall negotiated and voted for the bill, it could have been much better. Instead, they negotiated in bad faith, trying to poison the bill with no intention of voting for it no matter how much they liked it.\n"

Just covering women....).  Women were fine with men's products and procedures being covered, but men felt they were suddenly too important to return the favor.\n\nNo, I dont want separate policies, I want men to pay their share, just like women and I want the individual's right to privacy and right to receive equal value for their pharmaceutical coverage to come before the church's \"right\" to pry into women's health coverage."

The system is broken in terms of true representation, anyone looking for that is an idealist fool.

"The most important fact to keep in mind is that no matter how big of a handout the ACA is to insurance companies: over 1 million Americans now have or are going to have health insurance who didn't before. You can no longer be denied health insurance due to a pre-existing condition, and health insurance is now required by law to have a higher minimum standard of care.\n\nSure, we're FAR behind the rest of the 1st world in just about every standard in regards to health care, and the new system is equally far from perfect, but you have to keep in mind the progress that is currently being made on the matter DESPITE all the misinformation, lobbyists, corporations and a congress that is built on one half opposing the other half deadset on maintaining the status quo. So If you want to sit here and try and tell me that the ACA is bad and evil and that leading the world in health related bankruptcies is an American tradition, then by all means have at it."
