As a Catholic I believe that at mass the bread and wine are transformed into the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ. Of course it doesn't look or taste any different. But I *know* the Church teaches that the substance of the bread and wine change, not their physical properties, and that Jesus said it was his Body and Blood. \n\nSo here are the facts. I know them and there are a lot of people who have died for believing this. There have numerous miracles revolving around this phenomenon. There must be some truth to it. \n\n\"Faith for all defects supplying,\nWhere the feeble senses fail.\" - St. Thomas Aquinas\n\nThere are some things we can never understand with only our intellect, like love for instance.

"http://www.ancientfaith.com/podcasts/healingpresence/despondency\n\nFrom some of the Orthodox podcasts I have listened to, there is a thought of two forms of \"depression\". \n\nThe first, is what you are dealing with which is clinical depression. We do what we must to deal with it. Perhaps, a more active life can alleviate it, but many people do need resort to medication. There is no sin here. You have a physical aliment and must do what is necessary to take care of your body. The second, which is the one that tends to be more talked about from a Christian perspective is *acedia* (listlessness). It is a spiritual malady and a sin that we must beware of falling into.\n\nI leave it to you to listen (or read the transcript) of the above podcast since Dr. Rossi can probably do a better job of explaining it than I.\n\nUnfortunately, we are in a period where many of us seem to be hesitant in excepting that mental illnesses are real illnesses. Just remember that you are not alone. From what I recall, there are a number of subscribers in here who have to deal with different mental illnesses."

Aside from the obvious differences, such of polytheism vs monotheism, Christianity believes in a loving God who sacrificed his son (himself) for our sake.  In Greek mythology, the gods kept themselves separated from people.  They manipulated people for their own sake, and, unlike the Trinity, there was no harmony."
"&gt; It doesn't really change anything that it's written in a book rather than said verbally.\n\nIt makes a difference what the source is.

I think people will figure out that you're new to this and therefore extend you some grace and warmth rather than hitting you with a cane.\n\nOkay, in the Orthodox Church, sometimes old ladies will hit you with a cane anyway. To avoid this, if you go to an Orthodox Church, just be sure to stand during the Gospel reading, any of the \"entrances\" (the priest and everyboyd in the altar walks out of the altar and does a procession with stuff) and when the priest comes out with communion.

"This, also, is an amendment to state marriage.  No government can change the fundamental nature of marriage (whatever it happens to be).  All it can do is legally recognize marriage, which is all we're asking for.\n\nI've heard it plenty, and I disagree.  I do not share your theology on this matter.  Regardless, it doesn't matter if God hypothetically doesn't acknowledge it; that's not grounds for discrimination.  No one's religion is allowed to dictate what legal rights people are or aren't given.  There are a ton of people who are legally married whose marriages I don't think are religiously valid, and yet that doesn't mean they don't still deserve the right to get a *legal* marriage license.  Whether or not God acknowledges a marriage is between the couple and God.  Not the state.\n\nBottom line: Holy matrimony is a religious concept.  Marriage licenses are a legal, secular concept.  The topic at hand is the latter, not the former.  You can get legally married without holy matrimony and you can have holy matrimony without legal marriage.  They *usually* go together but that doesn't mean they're the exact same concept."

"And if we choose wrong, we are sent into a burning pit of torture. Just because we've seen no evidence of a god and decided that a god probably doesn't exist.\n\nThat's my problem with this. I need to see empirical evidence of a deity. And there is none. But this deity will still send me to Hell because I'm questioning his existence, using the rational brain that he apparently gave me! Does that sound fair to you? If I went up to you tomorrow and gave you a book filled with ancient tales about a cosmic, *transcendent* horse that governed the universe, and demanded that you convert, would you join my religion? What if I showed you a few historical points here and there, would you join? What if there were a few morals in the book but it was also filled with blood and gore? Would you join? What if I told you if you don't, you'll burn in a giant wasteland filled with the cosmic horse's dung? Would you join? No, you would ask for evidence of the cosmic horse. And I would say, \"You just have to believe in him. Let him into your heat. He's not visible because he's *testing your faith*.\" Would you join?\n\nNow I ask you, how is that any different from Christianity?\n\nI don't see how your first paragraph represents god. When you get into a relationship, it takes time to nurture it and allow it to blossom. You don't just sit down at the first date and plan everything out.\n\nAn ancient book isn't exactly the best way to communicate your message if you're a god. You can claim that the stories are simply allegorical and that they were written for the time period, but that would beg the question, *wouldn't god know how humanity would progress?* In the present moment, there's hundreds, thousands of debates raging about the historicity of the Bible, and whether or not things should be taken as allegorical or literal. This makes the Bible impossible to interpret truly. God wasn't very smart if he expected humans to know exactly which stories were allegorical and which were literal. There's hardly anything in the Bible that tells us what is allegorical and what is literal (as I mentioned before, the Parables of Jesus are said to be parables). But how about Noah's Ark? Should we take that as allegorical, as a story, since all the geological evidence goes against it? The Exodus out of the Egypt isn't supported by mainstream history or archaeology. Adam and Eve surely did not happen. There's vague evidence of the existence of Christ, and even if he did exist, how do we know that he actually did all those miracles? If Noah's Ark, the Exodus, Adam and Eve and the Talking Snake, etc did not actually happen, isn't that cherry picking to say that \"yes those are just stories but the Jesus story is true\"? How do we draw the line?\n\nThe answer is that we can't draw the line. The Bible is an ancient, chaotic book filled with contradictions, and obviously written in a time when people weren't educated and didn't know what the hell they were talking about.\n\nIf I were god, I would show empirical evidence of myself to humanity, and give them a book (if I go that route) that cannot be questioned and can only be interpreted in one way. No debates, no contradictions, no cherry picking. What would that book look like? I'm not an omnipotent, omniscient god so I don't know, but if I was I would know the perfect way of distributing my Word. And the current method, the Bible, isn't up to par."

"Historically speaking, yes. There's also no (historical) evidence that Jesus actually rose from the dead and there's significantly less evidence for Alexander the Great's existence than Jesus' existence, yet most people accept that Jesus and Alexander were actual human beings based on the circumstantial impact they left (regardless of how long it took to take effect or be documented) and Christians affirm that Jesus rose from the dead and believe it wholeheartedly. Both affirmations require faith, require trust, without complete proof, whether it be historical or religious in nature. \n\nNow as for early Christians, there is little evidence that Christians were fed to lions as you said. This could have been the case, but we simply don't know for sure, no matter how probable it seems. When it comes to accounts written long after events happen, people tend to read the present into the past in order to explain it. Luke did this in his gospel in order to make sense of and establish basis for the early church in Acts, and also did the same in Acts in order to show that the church of his time is the continuation of the church of the Apostles. \n\n\nEven outside Christianity, we see Josephus reading post-Temple Judaism into Jewish history and Virgil reading the Roman culture of his time into that of the Trojans in the Aeneid. Regardless of how farfetched or off-the-wall these interpretations were, they are nevertheless historical by the standards of the time. While modern historians shy away from these practices, they nevertheless interpret history themselves and must be taken with a grain of salt.\n\nIf you ask me, I certainly think that there are details in persecution stories that were added in later and were historically inaccurate. Though they are clearly works of interpretation, they are not necessarily false by virtue of being interpretations. These works were tell a story in order to show *all* of what happened, not just the bare facts, and it is in weighing the facts with reason that historians come to form an opinion to believe in. Knowing that all history is interpretation, it is us to us to rationally evaluate these opinions to the best of our ability and accept or reject them insofar as they reflect or distort truth."

"I've been moderately involved with IHOP-KC and the entire House of Prayer movement for at least 5 years. First I'll leave this here: http://www.ihopkc.org/about/affirmations-and-denials/ You can find their public statements on things such as the Latter Rain movement and the recent documentary that features them, \"God Loves Uganda\".\n\nWhen I first started attending some of their events I had the exact same feelings and thoughts that you did based on what others had told me. I am also very skeptical of most all church organizations, period. Usually I can nearly always see straight through when a pastor or church is acting out of wrong motives or against scripture. After attending and really seeking God I honestly feel that IHOP-KC is not what some in the public have made them out to be. I'll try to explain some of what I know and have seen there...\n\nI think what turns a most people off from IHOP and Mike Bickle's teachings is the emphasis on what they call \"the prophetic\". Prophecy is often viewed as a intensely mystical thing in scripture by the modern church. I know a little about Mike's past involvement with the Kansas City Prophets. I do know he has distanced himself from his past involvement with many of these groups and has even publicly recanted on his involvements. \n\nAnyway, from what I have experienced, \"prophecy\" at IHOP-KC is only endorsed for spiritual edification and comfort within the body of Christ alone. There's no one predicting the future, telling someone that God told them to get a divorce or sell their house or things of that sort. In fact, they highly advise people against such things. But for instance, you might experience someone singing a \"prophetic\" song where they call out spiritual issues that someone might be dealing with and then expanding upon that biblically. \"I feel there's someone here dealing with guilt. God says you are forgiven.\" etc. Everything is always backed with scripture and is always in a spiritual sense and is not seen as equal with scripture in any way. One experience I had was a lady who came up to me and asked to pray for me and that she sensed a sadness in my heart for someone close to me. I told her I honestly wasn't too sad at the moment and we both just laughed it off and she prayed for me in a general sense and we hugged and she walked away.\n\nAs for the \"cult\" accusations, I have never experienced any cult-like behavior there. Mike and other leaders publicly encourage the congregation not to take what they say at face value but to seek it in the scripture and through prayer and to come to their own conclusions. Neither Mike nor any of the other leaders are viewed as some special vessel, are not idolized in any form or seen as anything beyond Pastors. There are no rules that everyone must follow. Critical thinking is encouraged. I think there have been \"cult\" rumors because IHOP-KC describes itself as a \"missions base\". There is a strong community there and they almost have a communal society. They have dorms, restaurants and really everything you'd need if you were to live there. The strong community full of very passionate people can come off a little cult-ish at face value but I can highly assure you that they have no characteristics of a cult. Again, I was very iffy when I first heard of them as well and never accepted anything I heard or experienced there until researching either in scripture or in outside sources.\n\nAs for their fixation with Revelation, there is a strong emphasis on these scriptures and the return of Christ. It's honestly been the only thing that I've had some off feelings about when I was there. Mike has said in sermons that he believes Christ will come back during one of the living generations lifetimes, but has stated that it's only his opinion. Still, I highly dislike when people do things like this as I assume most others do as well. Revelation is one of the most controversial, if not the most, books of the Bible. So it's almost guaranteed that anything taught will be met with all sorts of feelings by a discerning congregation. Again though, none of the teachings or literature pieces that IHOP-KC endorses on eschatology or anything of the sort are presented as definite fact and I always here leaders encouraging healthy discussion and different opinions backed by scripture. At least from the messages I've heard.\n\nI know this was all kind of broad and I'd love to answer more general questions if you have them. I will say, above all else, what led me to IHOP-KC and their movement and made me keep coming back is simply what is at their core: The Prayer Room. Night and Day Prayer, Worship and Missions 24/7. My opinion of God and Christ were completely changed when I began to attend and I've grown deeply in my walk with Christ. Are there things that Mike and IHOP-KC believes that I disagree with? Absolutely, just like any other church group. But their emphasis and ability to carry out 24/7 Prayer and Worship for the past 15ish years is astounding to me and has kept me returning and is why I'll keep going unless I hear or see something that completely goes against the Bible or Christianity. The current overall opinion I have of their ministry is that they have been the catalyst to help me fall deeper in love with the Bible and Jesus and I fully believe He is worthy of 24/7 Worship, whether it's at IHOP or elsewhere."
"&gt; I don't see how your first paragraph represents god. When you get into a relationship, it takes time to nurture it and allow it to blossom. You don't just sit down at the first date and plan everything out.\n\nYet you demand that the book be everything planned out before you even ask her out.  You're upset because the Bible doesn't tell us every little detail from the get-go, yet you wouldn't do the same for a girl?\n\n&gt; If I were god, I would show empirical evidence of myself to humanity, and give them a book (if I go that route) that cannot be questioned and can only be interpreted in one way. No debates, no contradictions, no cherry picking. What would that book look like? I'm not an omnipotent, omniscient god so I don't know, but if I was I would know the perfect way of distributing my Word. And the current method, the Bible, isn't up to par.\n\nYou realize you'd basically be creating a game of Sims?\n\nNo one would be able to choose to do anything.  They'd just be dancing according to your every whim, and no real decisions would be made by anyone but you.  In fact, you'd be creating a world with *less* freedom than a game of Sims.  You'd be writing a book, and then reading that book to a bunch of puppets and praising yourself for being such a great, smart, kind God."

"This is a tough question for me because I've come to conclude that so much of what we think is ingrained by emotional patterns and conceptual grids that don't change easily. 15 minutes to talk about a topic doesn't make for a lot of space to get through those patterns and grids. So many people have this kneejerk, unintentional, and perhaps unconscious \"Mental illness = sin\" or \"= shameful\" that even if you tell them that's not the case, it might not go in well...\n\nAs I ponder, I wonder if perhaps part of what I might spend that 15 minutes doing is asking quite directly, \"When you think about depression or any kind of mental illness, what comes to mind? What thoughts come into your head? What do you feel?\" And then leave minutes of silence for people to ponder what's present in their own hearts and minds. The more aware people are of the space out of which they function, the more that space can perhaps get shifted around a bit.\n\nI might talk about Paul's thorn in the flesh and that perhaps for some people, mental illness can be God's thorn for their life or for a time. But I would also talk about the potential for healing through therapy and honest, open, and deep relationships and self-awareness. Perhaps I might try to differentiate between sin and finitude, weakness, need, frailty, and the like in the hopes of trying to pull people's grids away from sticking mental illness in the \"sin\" category. \n\nThose are just the first thoughts I have off the top of my head."

"No, because the scientific method requires us to believe which ever theory has the most scientific evidence. Unfortunately, that's the theory of evolution, not the Genesis account. Much like the theory that explains why things fall to the Earth, the theory of gravity. We can't \"see\" gravity, but it is still the best explanation for why things fall to the Earth. Much like we can't \"see\" evolution. Much like with gravity, we can see the products of the forces. That things fall down. And with evolution we can see the products of the process, such as the fossil record and vestigial organs. Humans. Mammals. We can see all of those things. Don't confuse a scientific experiment with the scientific method. The method is what most of us inately use to draw conclusions from our observations. To say a scientific theory requires faith is not even in the same ballpark as having faith in the Genesis account. It's like saying it requires faith to believe the sun will come up tomorrow. Technically true, but it's a logical fallacy to compare that with having faith in something despite there being more evidence for the contrary. You understand the difference, right?"

"I'm a E Free Church member, I posted the article as an affirmation of our faith. We all need to be ready to defend the gospel and also reach out to the lost. "

What does faith look like for a mentally ill person? What how should we offer the joy of the gospel to people with clinical depression without trivializing their disorder? How do we discern between issues of sin versus issues of mental illness, and what are appropriate responses?"
"Thanks for all the info, just read all these and I think the common theme between all of these is that they all sort of elevated these spiritual gifts, prophecies, and experiences to a level in which they were being worshiped instead of God. As a result, extrabiblical material (e.g. prophecies, dreams, visions) were used as explanations for their theology instead of the bible itself.\n\nThe last article was actually pretty shocking with the stuff that was mentioned, particularly Bickle's idea regarding a race of \"god-like\" men being present on earth.\n\nI'm not necessarily against some \"charismatic\" practices and beliefs so I was a bit unsure as to if this was just a matter of tongues, healing, etc. but it seems to be about a lot more than that."
"I am only coming from a loving angle.  I apologize if that offended you. If it comforts you, I'm an atheist. "
"No, I do not expect every little detail to show itself to me from the get-go. I understand that for such an important topic as this, one would need to spend a lot of time to read through it all. It's like reading a physics textbook; you can't expect to suddenly know *everything* the moment you open the book. That's arbitrary. What *is* arbitrary is that god made an ancient book filled with inconsistencies and confusion. We were just discussing this, whether or not something is literal or allegorical. A physics textbook doesn't tell you on one page that D=M/V and on the next that D=V/M. Likewise, it doesn't tell us things that contradict known science. It doesn't say that \"gravity\" doesn't exist, even though we know it to be. If the book said that, we wouldn't just say that it was \"allegorical\". We'd say the book is bullshit and deserves to be thrown into a fire.\n\nConcerning Sims: How is that any different from the god you believe in? You believe in the Bible, you \"accept\" Jesus into your \"heart\", hoping to get into heaven and not suffer in Hell. True, we have \"free will\", but how free *is* it when the punishment is clearly visible. It's pretty much forcing you into submission to god. God is poking you with the spear, telling you that you *technically* have free will but insisting that if you don't keep walking he'll stab you in the back. How free are you really? Without the threat of Hell, there's really no incentive to follow god, to accept Jesus. Why should I waste my time when there's no punishment? And god seems like a total cosmic douche when it comes to being a \"great, smart, kind god.\" Accept me, or die. I said it before and I'll say it again: he gave us \"free will\" and then gets mad at us for disobeying him.\n\nIf he had designed the world to be like Sims, it would work out a lot better for his purposes. In fact, there's no good reason why he even gave us a consciousness or free will if he's just going to get pissed when we disobey him using the rational minds he gave us!\n\n"

"Maybe Dawkins was \"just talking to the Galatians\" too. Context does mean everything, remember? Unfortunately though, I think you're twisting scripture here to suit your own needs. It's you who's context is off. Obviously, as Christians we know that all non-Christians are condemned. Paul is saying that we shouldn't accept the teachings of non-Christians. Much like Dawkins is saying we shouldn't accept the teachings of fundamentalist Christians. If we did, we would be teaching Bible study in public school, rather than scientific theories like the theory of evolution. Alas, we would be teaching the Genesis account as if it were a documentary. Paul is advising us the same thing but from a faith perspective. Otherwise we would be teaching the Koran in church. He's saying don't accept these other stories even if they have delusions about speaking with God. We have given you the right gospels to teach because we are the ones that had the correct communications with God. He's saying don't accept their teachings, but reject them. Condemn them. Same as Dawkins is saying. He's not saying go down to the mega church and laugh at them. He's saying we have these scientific theories and if someone wants to confuse faith with a theory and have faith rather than science being taught in school, reject that. Condemn that. But don't worry he's only talking to his students or his followers. Same as Paul, right? Besides, if what you're saying is true, the sermon on the mount need only apply to the people Jesus was speaking to."

"I think first and foremost you have to look at scripture, which says: \"Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and that you are not your own? For you have been bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body.\" (1 Corinthians 6:19, 20 NASB)\n\nThere is no explicit mention of marijuana, but it is repeated that we are to be \"sober minded\" (1 Peter 5:8, 2 Timothy 4:5) because our adversary is seeking to devour us. Above all, if you are leading a spirit-filled life (meaning it is filled by the Word) then it comes down to your own discernment. Love God, love people; if you do these two, do what you want. \n\nOn a personal note, I think marijuana should be legalized because of the money it brings to the government along with the numerous uses of hemp such as paper and clothing (google \"benefits of hemp\" to learn more). It goes against the \"norm\" of church going people, but it only seems logical. Legalization does not mean I want to use. "

But for instance, you might experience someone singing a \"prophetic\" song where they call out spiritual issues that someone might be dealing with and then expanding upon that biblically. \"I feel there's someone here dealing with guilt. God says you are forgiven.\" etc. Everything is always backed with scripture and is always in a spiritual sense and is not seen as equal with scripture in any way. One experience I had was a lady who came up to me and asked to pray for me and that she sensed a sadness in my heart for someone close to me. I told her I honestly wasn't too sad at the moment and we both just laughed it off and she prayed for me in a general sense and we hugged and she walked away.\nThis was actually really great to hear. I have a friend who goes to IHOP when he's back home and he told me a similar thing w/r/t prophecies (he even mentioned how it may be present in worship, which I'm pretty cool with from what I've heard).\n\nWith everything you said regarding cult-like behaviors, I have a similar experience right now in college because my campus ministry is large and  finds its strength in being a very tight-knit community. We have been called a cult before so I can see where you are coming from when talking about IHOP. I've heard a few horror stories (only online, not in person) about being \"forced\" to pray/fast and punishments being present if they don't do it. Though, I'm assuming this is the result of people who are a part of the internships or discipleship programs and unfortunately realizing they're not really invested in it. Have you heard any stories like these?\n\nEschatology is always controversial so I agree with you there. I feel that most times I've heard bits of Bickle's sermons, it almost always has to do with the end-times. This is obviously unfair though since I haven't actually heard any of his sermons in full ha.\n\nRegardless of all of this, I'm really glad that you have been able to grow at IHOP and that it's ultimately helped you fall more in love with the Bible and Jesus more than anything. I've found their 24/7 prayer room streams to be really beneficial as well and I think some of their worship leaders are some of the best around nowadays.\n\nAlso, if you know anything about YWAM I'd really appreciate it because I've heard numerous things about that as well."

"&gt; I wasn't free because I was believing lies, and I was sinning against God because I gave depression a foothold in my life, and that I couldn't be free until I repented and that my disease of the soul would be healed if I turned to Jesus.\n\nTo which I might respond, were I brave enough:\n\n&gt; Depression doesn't feel like something that I am holding on to. It doesn't feel like a self indulgence. It feels like reality. It feels like my logically reasonable state of being.\n\n&gt; What, specifically, would it look like to repent of depression? Is it a one-time event where I cry to Jesus for deliverance? Fine, I can do that. I **have** done that. But I still struggle with depression. So what am I to do now? When I wake in the morning, I despair. When I have a spare moment when I am not distracted by work, I remember how meaningless my life is. Are you suggesting that I fight against all of these natural-feeling thoughts and take these thoughts captive for Christ? If so, I know that I am not strong enough to do this. I am emotionally exhausted **all the time** and don't have the strength to beat back these thoughts. In short, if this is what I have to do, I will need help.\n\n&gt; So I have this question: what are **you** willing to do to help me overcome depression? If the answer is \"not much,\" then thank you for your opinion and we can talk again some other time.\n\n**TL;DR** Don't tell me to will myself to change when my will is crushed, unless you are committing yourself to actually help me change."

"Sorry, I'm not following your line of thought.  You're stating completely different things at the same time.  In the link of /u/DyingDaily Dawkins states to ridicule and mock.  That is a very different attitude than condemn.  That's just 1 instance of many where Dawkins ridicules and mocks Christians.   \n\nDawkins is on the offensive, attacking.  He's not telling Atheists to be wary of creation or ID.  [He's saying mock them, ridicule.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51rR4aC9aMg)  Very much different than \"not accept teachings of fundamentalist Christians\".\n\nPaul is on the defensive telling Galatia to be wary of incorrect teachings.  He says that people incorrectly teaching will be accursed and to not follow these ways.  \n\nYou're making wide leaps that aren't exactly congruent.  Jesus preached to a multitude of people and his disciples for the sermon on the mount, so that's not applicable.  Dawkins is outspoken about mocking Christians on many different avenues, so that cannot be related either.\n\nThere's still many avenues of macroevolution that are in contention.  With recent developments coming out every month now that the DNA genome has been mapped, DNA found in dino bones, etc.  \n\nThe main thing is, follow the science.  Dawkins rejects the science because someone believes in a different origin.  That's more closed minded than the people he mocks.  "

"But, where is enforced that your specific god gets the special treatment of being spelled with a capital? Because, if it's the god of the *Jewish Trilogy* (Judaism, Christianity &amp; Islam), it already has a few names that are capitalized: Y, J, &amp; A. "
"YWAM used to teach an aberrant theology called Moral Government Theology. Some leaders still do teach it even though officially YWAM has stopped teaching it. "
"you have good intentions, but are woefully under-prepared to handle real historical criticism from academic sources. I suggest you do some reading on how to respond to the claims that these scholars assert. otherwise, you will be unable to reach them.\n\nfor one, they have an entirely different view of prophecy than you do. The academic understanding of prophecy is not that god spoke to a person who then wrote it down, but that these comic- book like stories with heroic Jews that happen to have generic character names (Danial means \"God is my judge,\" Elijah means \"Yahweh is my god\")were written and edited and compiled by several groups of redactors years after the  events of the actual stories. \n\nthe first example they use to describe this phenomenon is 2 Kings 22:8, which states that \n\n\"Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the secretary, \"I have ***found* the Scroll of the Law** in the temple of the LORD.\" He gave it to Shaphan, who read it.\n\nthis scroll is most likely Deuteronomy, which includes many laws regarding the king. We can tell because King Josiah (who was 8 when his father was assassinated, leaving the priests effectively in charge) immediately enacted all of the laws in this scroll, going so far as to burn the bones of priests that served other gods. This flies in the face of the tradition that Moses wrote all 5 books of the law (including his own death scene in Deuteronomy). \n\nNow back to Daniel. in the later chapters, the writer(s) of Daniel go out of their way to establish the character by saying \"I, Daniel\" again an again, as if to convince us of authorship. Daniel's description of History in the alternate visions of the statue and the beasts (kingdoms) with horns (kings) is an example of a circular understanding of time: namely, that which has happened will happen again. The references to kings of the north marrying with the south are considered to be referring to the Seleucid and Ptolemaic Empires that emerged after Alexander's death (the large horn will split into smaller horns). \n\nthe basic understanding is that Daniel was written during the time of King Antiochus. Daniel's undying faith would have been a great story to the persecuted Jews in the late second temple period, with visions used as code to speak to the community. Daniel speaks of a little horn (Antiochus) being defeated by one like the son of man. He makes a fool of the Evil King Nebuchadnezzer and gives hope to the people just like Ezekiel speaking to a \"Valley of Dead Bones\" (Really Jewish slaves in Exile). \n\nThe Apocalyptical literature keeps the faith of the people, who believe they will be rescued or be brought back to life. God's control of history means that Antiochus will fall and the faithful will be rewarded.  "

"I'm skeptical because in the 12th century the Knights Templar were accused of worshiping it and quite frankly I believe it.

"Lou Engle does participate with IHOP on a few things and often speaks there. I honestly don't know anything about his beliefs really.

I think the \"One Thing\" internship. She never told me about anyone being forced to fast/pray but I do know that part of the internship requires a certain amount of hours weekly in the prayer room so I could imagine other requirements that would be part of it. I'm sure they tell people about that before signing up, at least I'd hope so.\n\nMy friend is involved with YWAM. I don't know anything about the ministry's beliefs or practices though."
"You don't seem to be making much sense. Your saying Paul's letter is only meant for the original reader but Jesus speech wasn't only meant for the original audience.

Don't just say we'll there's a couple fringe theories that some people are buying into. Your position is based on faith. That's fine. But don't pretend it's based science. If Genesis supported evolution you'd be driving around with a Darwin bumper sticker. And yes mockery and ridicule can fall under the umbrella of condemnation. So you're wrong there too."

"&gt; Let's remember that kid having cancer is part of God's plan anyway...\n\nThat kind of contradicts the rest of your post about free will doesn't it? If the cancer was part of God's plan what if praying for a cure is part of the plan too? By praying we are actively participating in the will of God. Don't get hung up on the notion of free will when it comes to prayer. God tells us to pray and he tells us prayer works, so we pray. I'm not really concerned how that meshes with anyone's notion of \"free will\" I just know what God has spoken in his word."

We are adults with free will and the ability to make mature decisions. \n\nI wouldn't listen to a song praising or practicing pagan practices, but I don't have a problem with music about mythology or referencing such things because thats history and people believed that. My brother is a little pickier and challenged me about it but in the end we have pretty much agreed to disagree. Its nothing major, more of a difference in perception. \n\nInterestingly enough when my brother and I first started getting into it my mom and sister were in the sort of \"heavy metal is of the devil\" camp and in my experience that came from people erring on the side of caution because of stereotypes or had one bad experience and never had any others due to personal preference. They still don't like it, but they were way more sympathetic when we showed them some of the more historical, mythological and literature based songs and the literary merit of some of the lyrics. I think its just people do tend to get closed minded by nature and someone can only be so well rounded. I'm also into opera, and plenty of Christians have challenged me on that. \n\nAlso, you might like Theocracy. Christian power metal with some progressive stuff too.

"My parents have been huge fans of their church since long before they were called IHOP. They are basically fraudsters who sell a version of Christianity that is centered around faith healers and prophets who never get any of their predictions right, and they try to suck hapless high school graduates into their cultish prayer/faith healing school.\n\nTheir prophetic sermons and messages used to have a heavy emphasis on how Mike Bickle's quadriplegic brother [Pat Bickle](http://beyondgrace.blogspot.jp/2011/08/mike-bickle-white-horse-prophecy.html) was going to get healed, and how that would spark a new revival of prophets, apostles, and healers. But when Pat finally died of his condition, they basically expunged all record of him from their website, their sermon recordings, and so on — like he'd never existed, and they'd never made false predictions about him.\n\nIt is also ironic that, for a church whose pastors claim to have supernatural anointing for prophecy and discernment, one of their leaders was recently busted for running a drug and sex ring inside his cell group, and for hiring church members to murder his wife — yet Mike Bickle and Company had no clue.\n\nAnother prophetic failure of theirs was the \"pray for rain\" conference Mike Bickle spearheaded for Texas governor Rick Perry — after which, Texas had its worst drought in history. \n\nThere is also the matter of Lou Engle, a bigoted IHOP leader who has been involved in various anti-homosexual campaigns and efforts, including the \"kill the gays\" law in Uganda.\n\nIn summary: IHOP = prophets of Baal in the Elijah story.

"Oh really? Then you're just the person to answer my question. I'm assuming you hold the position that prayer can be used more than just to worship. That prayer can influence God's behavior so that He will intervene. So why doesn't He just cure all cancer? Why doesn't He make it so no babies are born with lifelong debilitating diseases like cystic fibrosis? Why doesn't He prevent typhoons like the recent one in the Philippines which destroyed entire villages and left millions homeless? I'm assuming you prayed for the Philippines, right? For God to ease their suffering, help them get food, prayed that another storm wouldn't come right away? So why not just avoid all that in the first place? "

"Copying this from [a thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1tzf85/) made a couple days ago about Bickle: \n\n&gt; It's kind of a mixed bag. I'm from KC and know a few people involved with IHOPkc, so its been on my radar for a while.\n&gt; \n&gt; They do some good things. They bring people to what they think is Christianity, a lot of the people are very active in the church, 24/7 prayer is a great idea, etc. \n&gt; \n&gt; That being said, it definitely runs like a cult. key_lime_pie's link is a good starting point, and you'll find tons more that mostly backs up that position by Googling 'Kansas City Prophets' or 'IHOP cult'. \n&gt; \n&gt; They're starting to contradict themselves more as time goes on, and it'll only be a matter of time before a scandal causes it to crash. \n&gt; \n&gt; Here's some reading, if you're interested:\n&gt; \n&gt; On contradictions: http://beyondgrace.blogspot.com/2011/08/mike-bickle-white-horse-prophecy.html\n&gt; \n&gt; Onething last year: http://www.pitch.com/kansascity/international-house-of-prayer-onething-conference-kansas-city/Content?oid=3119424&amp;showFullText=true\n\nBasically, it comes down to this:\n\n1. The mysticism (visions, \"healing\", speaking in tounges, etc.) makes some people weary.\n2. Bickle's cult of personality - at least to the outsider, it seems like they put him on an extremely high pedestal.\n3. The previous two can really make their views on following Christ a bit cloudy. Speaking anecdotally, a lot of the members probably do follow Christ, or at least think they are. It's not really my realm to pass judgment on what makes a \"true Christian\". \n4. Their members tend to be fairly engaged in the church. This may be confusing to some people who never do anything more than go to a service a week.\n5. The whole contradiction thing with Bickle. \n6. The church is starting to contradict itself. tl;dr: [this](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/07/us/twists-in-bethany-deaton-murder-case-put-spotlight-on-charismatic-sect.html).

"&gt; So the atheist seeking to communicate an accurate answer to the question “Why is there not nothing?” will find himself borrowing theologically inflected terminology\n\nChallenge accepted! \n\nOur brain is a wonderful tool to understand our percieved reality, and one of the things it does when comprehending things is to build models that are way simpler than the real things. Imagination is powerful but also dangerous, as it can easily go wild if the individual doesn't force himself to think rationally. Rational thinking is an habit learned from adults, and it often relies on verbal communication, which is also a very powerful system with its own flaws. \n\nA very economic way to represent and transmit ideas is to use negations, so we live with very useful concepts like nobody, nothing, nowhere, empty, zero, etc. So “Why is there not nothing?” can be answered with \"I don't know, I only know something. I can imagine this nothing you are talking about, but it probably is just a concept.\""

"LOL...my first non-theological book. Going to be a *mal voyage* story - the true tale of a guy named Pierre Mayeux who left France with his new wife at the age of 20, sailed across the Atlantic (4 month journey) to the French territory of Louisiana. Landed in Biloxi, made his way to what is now Arkansas Post where he was to work as an indentured servant. But making his way, mind you, included building his own boat, and working his way UP the Mississippi River (remember, no steam, no engines, just ropes and paddles). Oh - he also had to deal with wild animals (literally 20 foot long gators), Indians, mosquito clouds, near starvation in Biloxi, and a host of other horrible things.\n\nAt the time Baton Rouge was literally a tent town of a few families, and New Orleans was a mud-street frontier village with a couple hundred people living in very primitive conditions.\n\nA few months after he was in Arkansas the \"company\" that brought him to the new world (John Law's Company of the Indies - google it) went bankrupt and he was left to his own devices.\n\nHe ended up in Natchez where in 1729 he was one of only two men to be captured and subsequently survive a massacre of the French village by Natchez Indians. They held him hostage, but butchered (literally) around 600 other men, women and children. In all about 60 people survived.\n\nHe ended up settling in Avoyelles Parish, Louisiana (north of Baton Rouge) and died at the age of 48, a successful farmer and landowner.\n\nHis story is just an amazing tale of survival. I wish Mel Gibson would read the book and make a movie."

"\"Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God. Therefore whoever resists the authorities resists what God has appointed, and those who resist will incur judgment. For rulers are not a terror to good conduct, but to bad. Would you have no fear of the one who is in authority? Then do what is good, and you will receive his approval, for he is God’s servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword in vain. For he is the servant of God, an avenger who carries out God’s wrath on the wrongdoer. Therefore one must be in subjection, not only to avoid God’s wrath but also for the sake of conscience. For because of this you also pay taxes, for the authorities are ministers of God, attending to this very thing. Pay to all what is owed to them: taxes to whom taxes are owed, revenue to whom revenue is owed, respect to whom respect is owed, honor to whom honor is owed.\" - Romans 13:1-7\n\n\"Submission to Authority Be subject for the Lord’s sake to every human institution, whether it be to the emperor as supreme, or to governors as sent by him to punish those who do evil and to praise those who do good. For this is the will of God, that by doing good you should put to silence the ignorance of foolish people. Live as people who are free, not using your freedom as a cover-up for evil, but living as servants of God. Honor everyone. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the emperor. Servants, be subject to your masters with all respect, not only to the good and gentle but also to the unjust. For this is a gracious thing, when, mindful of God, one endures sorrows while suffering unjustly. For what credit is it if, when you sin and are beaten for it, you endure? But if when you do good and suffer for it you endure, this is a gracious thing in the sight of God. For to this you have been called, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, so that you might follow in his steps.\" - 1 Peter 2:13-21\n\n\"Remind them to be submissive to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good work, to speak evil of no one, to avoid quarreling, to be gentle, and to show perfect courtesy toward all people.\" - Titus 3:1-2"

But you just keep going around in circles claiming that when Paul writes a letter it need not apply to anyone outside of his audience,  but when Jesus and Richard Dawkins make an assertion it is meant to apply to all of their followers regardless of context. That's the circle of illogical reasoning you are taking me on. But you've also gone so far as to claim you have something that disproves the scientific theory of evolution, and/or have scientific evidence for the Genesis account. I'd like you to walk me through that line of circular reasoning as well, if you'd be so inclined. Oh and no disrespect taken about that low road low blow. We all make mistakes and misjudge.

Your pastors will have answers to a lot of what you ask and the truth is the only thing you can trust in is Jesus ALONE.\nThe only hope we have to getting to heaven is Jesus and that's why we must trust only in him and not our own feelings.\nTo be honest with you, I still have anxiety and I don ever see it going away, like you I can't live in a state of peace in my mind. Feels like life is useless because I might go to hell, at one point I had suicidal thoughts because I had not talked to anyone. My main advice is to talk to a pastor and spend time in gods word and talking to him.\nI'm sorry I'm not the best in English but that were my thoughts ands feelings from the heart as I am in the same situation.\nI will pray for you and your sister."

"Let's be clear: this for the dad, not the kids. It may get you to study the Bible more and pray more for your kids, which is great, but if you're deluded if you think our kid is going to want your Bible full of 10 years of notes.\n\nHere's the scenario: Parnell has been thinking of doing this project as a New Years resolution. He also needs an article for the new year for the Desiring God blog. Win-win!\n\nThe problem is, he hasn't yet done a project like this or thought it through very much. He has links to the types of pens and pencils you should use but can't give much help in the area of what you'll actually write. He's grasping at straws trying to flesh it out and comes up with stuff like this:\n\n&gt; yellow for importance, pink for repeated content within a specific book, and sky blue for inter-textual allusions\n\nAren't these things already documented extensively? This is great for personal study, but if you want to give that to your kids, get a book on Amazon.\n\n&gt; Or you might want to write a whole devotional commentary, filling up all the space you can with meditations and application\n\nInstead of trying to write an inspirational devotional for your kids (which is probably not your strength) why not get them some age-appropriate commentaries on Amazon and save yourself a load of time.\n\n&gt; FAQs: What if I have more than one child?\n\nWhy is this question after the article? The majority of families have or plan on having more than one child. It's more evidence that he hasn't thought this through at all. \n\n&gt; Dream of the Impact\n\nYes, he's dreaming.\n\n**A better plan:**\n\n10 years of daily or weekly prayers seems like a bit much. Instead, consider writing one longish prayer per season. Much smaller time commitment and likely the same impact: 40 long prayers written to you throughout your kid's life vs 500 tiny ones scribbled in margins."

"I agree. My mom listens to some of the more lukewarm Christian stuff and it all sucks. It's also mostly all Pop music or soft rock. I'm a Metalhead, though, and the Christian Metal, especially metalcore, scene is fantastic. August Burns Red is a karma goldmine over on /r/metalcore and they're a Christian group. A lot of the Christian hard rock and metal stuff is not only musically awesome if you're into that type of music, but also very anointed by God, you can tell they mean it."

"Archeology is super interesting but not when it comes from Geeky Christian.\n\nThe problem is, it's much easier to get funding for archeologists when they can make a link, however tenuous, to something in the Bible, even though most discoveries have nothing to do with the events in the Bible other than being in the Middle East.\n\nFor instance:\n\n&gt; #1. The Tabernacle Area at Shiloh\n&gt; They now claim they have discovered the location of the tabernacle in Shiloh\n\nWhat's their evidence? (emphasis mine)\n\n&gt; holes carved into the ground... which *could* have held the beams of The Tabernacle\n\nThat's hardly evidence at all for being the Tabernacle but because they were able to tie it to the Bible they'll get plenty of funding to continue their research. And who knows, it may end up being the Tabernacle but for now to suggest so would be wishful thinking."

And, if he did say something that was understood correctly then it was deemed liberal even though the Church has been saying the same thing for years. \n\nSo that, on top of the already large numbers of misconceptions of the Church, I can't really say it surprises me that people believed a satire site. Then again, the number of times that one sees/hears something mentioned that takes five seconds leading to snopes being the first link saying it's false is rather high."

"Exodus 30:26 gives some context: \"With it you shall anoint the tent of meeting and the ark of the testimony\"\n\nThus, in reference to marijuana this would mean, \"Don't use marijuana to anoint the tent of meeting.\"\n\nThe Leviticus passage, when read in reference to marijuana, would suggest that God would be unhappy if you make an unauthorized offering, and would be especially upset if it were weed instead of incense.\n\nI think /u/ahrkeeng has had too much marijuana for today."
"&gt; 15 “*If you love Me, keep My commandments.* 16 And I will pray the Father, and He will give you another Helper, that He may abide with you forever— 17 the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees Him nor knows Him; but you know Him, for He dwells with you and will be in you. 18 I will not leave you orphans; I will come to you. 19 “A little while longer and the world will see Me no more, but you will see Me. Because I live, you will live also. 20 At that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you. 21 *He who has My commandments and keeps them, it is he who loves Me.* And he who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will love him and manifest Myself to him.” 23 Jesus answered and said to him, “*If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word;* and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our home with him. 24 He who does not love Me does not keep My words; and the word which you hear is not Mine but the Father’s who sent Me.\" \n\n- Excerpts from John 14, my emphasis added to highlight Jesus' own definition of what it means to love Him.\n\nJesus, being one with God, has made it pretty clear in numerous portions of the Bible that engaging in sexual relationships outside of the confines of marriage (defined by Jesus in Matthew 19:2-9 as involving a man and woman) is contrary to His commandments. So any sexual relationships outside of marriage is not in keeping with Jesus' commandments and therefore is unloving of Him. \n\nYou may believe that your friends both love Jesus, but according to Jesus they don't because they do not keep His commandments.\n"
"And if marijuana were witchcraft or sorcery, that would mean something.\n\nThere's a reason that our English versions translate \"sorceries\" instead of \"drugs\".\n\nReading \"pharmakeia\" as recreational marijuana use is molding the Bible to be what you think it should be, when instead you should be molding what you think to match what the Bible says. I would go so far as to say that claiming that these verses are forbidding marijuana use is taking the Lord's name in vain."

Let's go ahead and take a step back before condemning these people you don't even know. So, to you I say, YOU may believe that you love Jesus, but according to Jesus you don't because you don't keep his commandments. Because guess what, there's none righteous among us, \"no not one\".

"&gt; You're stretching quite a bit of scripture there to try and make Jesus say what you want, considering he never said a single sentence on homosexuality. Levitical law says it, and Paul briefly touches on it, but never the J-man.\n\nJesus and God are one and the same. So actually Jesus' Commandments are found all throughout the Bible. But I should have expected to have to explain this if I were foolish enough to comment in r/Christian. Also Jesus defines Marriage in Matthew 19:2-9. I know, I know, you'll come back and tell me that He was talking about something else, and / or isn't actually excluding any other type of sexual relationships. Why do I even bother?\n\n&gt; Do YOU keep all of his commandments every hour of every day?\n\nNo I don't. Fortunately Christ's grace is sufficient. Once again, another basic to the faith is that purposefully living a life of sin is unacceptable to God. When I confess my sins and pray for forgiveness, Christ covers them. But like I said, this is r/Christian so I should have known I was going to be having this discussion. \n\nIt's so mind boggling that you can interpret the Bible the way you do. I guess we can just all do whatever we want then, right? I mean, after all, none of us are righteous, no not one.  But we know that Christ is going to save SOMEBODY, even though that person isn't righteous (because nobody is). So glad to learn that I can do whatever I want and still go to heaven.

"(This may or may not relate to you, pick and choose what you want). When I was in high school, I wanted a boyfriend so I wouldn't feel lonely.  I was jealous of my friends who had boyfriends, they seemed happy and had it all together.\n\nIn reality, I was just really depressed and unhappy with myself, didn't feel comfortable in my own skin. Getting a boyfriend didn't solve that problem, because it's a really immature way to look at relationships. It's like some young girls who want to get pregnant to have a baby who will always love them--but then the baby turns two years old and starts saying \"no\" all the time, because that baby is becoming a person with their own wants and needs.  \n\nI ended up marrying my first boyfriend and it was a bad marriage because all my happiness/not loneliness was based on him, his feelings and how he treated me.  Basically, I wasn't a whole person who was separate without him.\n\nWe got divorced 15 years later.  Four years out, I have learned to be happy just on my own, and to be happy with myself.

"There is a pretty big argument that there is actually no \"Hell\" - or at least as we imagine.

This valley was used to burn off various unwanted items (rubbish and such) - and the dead bodies of criminals. So, say to the people listening to Christ's Sermon on the Mount, the intended meaning was clear, but for us, the context is lost. Upon the second coming, there will be a series of resurrections - the first being the people who have chosen Christ and through him, God, and the second being those offered Salvation through Christ. Those who are offered salvation but refuse effectively \"cease to be\". (This is the destruction of the wicked that is often mentioned).

"&gt; when Christians talk of sexual sin they mean homosexuality 99.9% of the time\n\n...Because no christian has ever talked about promiscuity, cheating on spouses, prostitution, indecency, or teenage sex before. Where have you been? Most people start their talks about sex at the home. And while most Christians are worried about their kids / spouse / themself having sex, usually they AREN'T that worried that they'll immediately turn out homosexual unless they have an indication of it being a likelihood."
"Well, look at it this way. If God is all-just, then someone in hell who fully repents of all their wrongdoing, and totally learned their lessons should be on their way to heaven. Maybe not immediately, but at least beginning the journey."
"&gt; Philosophically if not historically, the theism of ... major religious currents outside the Western tradition, begins with the observation that the mystery of being is irreducibly mysterious, absolutely immune to attempts at demystifying it. The articulation of thought about what that mystery is — “Not how the world is, is the mystical, but that it is,” in Wittgenstein’s succinct rendition of the matter — has been so honed by succeeding generations of thinkers descended from the union of Greek philosophy and Jewish, Christian, and Islamic theology that it’s now difficult for anyone, whether theist or atheist, to improve on their exact formulations.\n\nDo *not* speak for me, especially when you haven't the slightest idea of my theology."

"I don't \"have\" depression, but for the last month since I realized I had severe teeth problems, I definitely fell into some. Nothing is more tedious than someone who thinks that they know that if you just tried religion that would solve everything... as if you didn't do so already.

"I have gone through the exact same thing as your sister, and I have been in that fear and anxiety boat before. I have done that dance a couple times actually, the last time being fairly recent. It got to the point where I was so anxious all the time that I could not eat, I could not sleep, I really couldn't do much of anything without feeling desperately alone, lost, and completely terrified. Here is what I learned in overcoming it. Fear is a tool by the enemy. God never uses fear on us, He works with love and correction.\n (1) Speak against the fear. This may seem weird, and may feel weird, but trust me, words hold power. God does not condemn, He redeems. This fear is trying to keep you and your sister down. Speak against it because it has already lost. Your victory is promised because Jesus already won. Look at 1 John 4.\n(2) Learn the word. Don't just read it, study and memorize. Knowing God's word and putting it into action through prayer, fighting the enemy by using verses will increase your knowledge and grow you in spiritual warfare ability. Yes, I said warfare because that is what this is. \n(3) Find a pastor you trust, or spiritual leader, and connect with them. Pray with them, and let them know what is going on. They have most likely either dealt with something like this before and know how to help, or have actually gone through it themselves and can let you know how they got through it. As one who has done this dance I will pray for you and feel free to message me and I will do the best I can to help, or at least point you in the right direction. Keep praying and keep fighting! You've already won! God bless. "

No particular verses come to mind but I'm pretty sure that's a scriptural command.\n\nI don't think that necessarily means going to church on Sundays, but that's a tradition we have, and it probably dates back to the times when Christianity was just a few thousand people in Jerusalem.\n\n&gt; i also thought what is chruch like?\n\nI go to a non-denominational church. It's basically:\n\n1. Worship (singing songs about God, to God)\n2. Bread and wine\n3. News/announcements\n4. Sermon (teaching about God/Christian life)\n5. A bit more worship\n6. Coffee break\n7.

"I see that you've already had many responses to this post but I just wanted to add my thoughts and encouragement as well. \n\nI am current battling severe anxiety and depression that is both caused by the anxiety as well as it being its own worsening condition. I've struggled with it since 4th grade and I am now in 10th grade. I just wanted to tell you that I am on four different medications right now and they definitely help but something else that has helped me a lot was my descision to truly commit to following God. It sucks that this woman, though she was attempting to be understanding, approached you in this way. But something I wanted to remind you of is that not only do you have the support of your church and Reddit, even if they go about it in the wrong way, but most importantly you have the unfailing, amazing love of God. Christians, although we have accepted Christ, are not perfect and sometimes, like the woman in your case, hurt others be it intentional or not. But no matter what God knows your heart and suffers alongside you as you struggle with this disease and I know that He does so for me as well. \n\nSomething I would suggest to you to help with this struggle, if you are not already doing it, is to be sure to try and cultivate your own, private relationship with God. (You seem really involved in your church and I'm sure you already do this, so I guess I'm saying keep going!) Please don't think I'm saying that you need to be a better Christian. I really am just letting you know that reading my Bible nightly and writing in a sort of prayer/general thoughts for God journal has begun to really help me at least have the strength to continue with daily life although the struggle has not ceased. I believe that having my own private time has helped because with God and an issue like this there is no judgement.  He knows that people with depression cannot help the way they are and He will never tell you to be a better Christian or that the depression is something you can overcome if you just try to tell happy. Christian fellowship is important, don't get me wrong, but issues like this where it can be extremely hard for other humans to understand, God is the one being who fully understands your struggles and I find that comforting to dwell one as I spend time along with Him nightly. \n\nI also can see from your post that, if I am getting the right idea, you are hurting due to people pulling away or blaming you. I just want to say that unfortunately with mental illness I find there often is an extra amount of this that occurs as people just seem to have a really hard time figuring out how to react and what to do when they can't just fix us. I don't have any ideas here as I am actually having an increasingly hard time interacting with people lately and I have a very limited social life right now. But I can say that I care about you and you will be in my prayers. Even though we have not met face to face, I am at least one person among many others in this thread who can now be considered people who will not pull away and will continue to support you if you need it, as much as we can through the internet. \n\nSorry this got so long and please excuse typos as I wrote it on my phone. I will be praying for you. :) "
"Cool that seems like something i could get behind! thank you!"
"Its a mindset of not trusting in your mindset/ understanding rather trust that God knows what is better for you. Romans anything not of faith is sin, this means whatever you are not trusting the Lord on is sin. It is as simple as believing to be saved, there is simply nothing that you do, but if in fact you do believe your actions will change. This is why James says faith without works is dead."
"Absolutely through others would be one of many ways. We as Christians believe any good that comes from us in fact comes from God's Spirit so when I love it is the Love of God that is working through me this is what is known as model-dependent realism, what you are asking for is anti-realism. There are many other ways, through His word and through answers to prayer, incomprehensible peace and many others. I found Him to be real not only on a qualitative standard but also quantitative as well. does this help?"

And if anyone’s name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.\n\n# Matthew 13:41, 42 ESV\n\nThe Son of Man will send his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all causes of sin and all law-breakers, and throw them into the fiery furnace.

"I don't mean to undermine you. I want you to know the Lord God."
"I don't think so. He'd probably declare those a misuse of the natural order caused by the Fall. He might not call them evil at all. It's hard to say, since that's from  the 5th century."
"Well, in Catholic eschatology, immediately following death there's the specific judgement, where Our Blessed Lord goes through a person's life, and reveals the true state of their soul.  More importantly however, Our Blessed Lord will reveal whether the soul sought His mercy, or not.  Our Blessed Lord will in other words, show you to yourself so to speak.  And when the judgement is pronounced, assuming that the judgement is for eternal damnation, the soul will actually run headlong into Hell because it is too painful and shameful for the damned to remain in the presence of Our Blessed Lord.  There's also some text to the effect that upon the pronouncement of a judgement of eternal damnation that the soul experiences a complete and total hatred of Our Blessed Lord.  My guess would be out of pride, because it will be made irrefutably clear, and perfectly known to the damned soul that they were offered the mercy of Our Blessed Lord, that they needed  desperately to repent, and seek that mercy, and yet they stubbornly refused to so.  Unable to dispute the facts laid bare, unable to dispute the judgement its self, hating their very creation since they'll now spend eternity in Hell, yet unable to endure the Holy Presence of Our Blessed Lord, they flee, we are told, into Hell because there's no longer anywhere else to go.  \n\n&gt;Hell as a punishment from God, as he so judges? \n\nHell is not so much a punishment but the respect for the choices that a person made in life.  The unrepentant sinner does not want to be in the presence of Our Blessed Lord.  The presence of Our Blessed Lord is painful for them, and they would not be happy in that presence.  \n\n&gt;but what happens when a sinner in Hell, who once went away from God, started to love Him?\n\nThe eternally damned lose the ability to repent.  Once the soul is separated from the body, the eternal fate of a soul is unchangeable.  \n\nOtherwise, it'd be possible to pray someone into Heaven.  How is it just for the person who steadfastly refused to seek God's loving mercy to have a change of heart when it can do us, on earth, still having the options before us, to have the opportunity to avail themselves of mercy postmortem when it can do us no benefit?  How is it just for someone to turn against an infinitely loving and merciful God, and not ask for mercy, and seek to make amends, yet still be admitted to the eternal rest of paradise?  \n\nMoreover, at the general judgement, because Our Lord is just, every person from Adam, to the last man will have every bit of their lives scrutinized, for two reasons.  The saved will want to see the mercy, and love of God, and how it worked in the lives of people, both saved, and damned.  And the saved will want to see the full effects of the sins, which Our Lord will only make known on this day.\n\nTo summarize, Hell is something that we choose, and not a punishment as such.  Of course, the spiritual realms are chock full, absolutely chock full of beings which want to visit harm upon the creation of Our Blessed Lord.  When you reject His mercy in a final and complete manner, I would imagine that their power is no longer restrained by His grace.  They are free, completely free to inflict whatever torture and misery they want upon the damned soul.  Hell in that sense is a punishment for the enemy because the enemy had perfect knowledge, and knew the outcome of their rebellion.  That's why it's full of fire.  If it wasn't for them, other than the deprivation, one could imagine Hell as a state of perpetual frustration, but not much in the way of torture.  But thanks to the fall of the angels...  it's a lot worse.  Infinitely worse."

"&gt; When I joined, I was concerned about the gnosticism aspect\n\n&gt; In fact, the teachings of masonry encourage a man to think for himself. It presents a structure and ritual, but if you examine them, you discover that it is open to interpretation, and that you are encouraged to interpret it in any way that makes you a better man.\n\nThat is exactly what gnosticism is.  Gnosticism isn't a tightly wound theology.  Gnostics were bound together by their practice of Gnosis, or personal revelation, not their theology.  Gnosis may translate to \"Knowledge\" but it's implied definition is \"Knowledge through Experience\".  Experience of meditation, of alchemy, of ritual, etc.  The masonic rites are an outward production of Gnosis.  You have to have the knowledge and the experience, to know how to apply it in \"real time\" which are what the rites are about, a demonstration of your knowledge using experience."

Really engage them.  Don't try to invalidate them, but see the reason in them and why they show flaws in immature faith systems.  And if you can find a more mature faith through the process, maybe you can help him find that as well."

Believe me, I know what scripture says, no matter how you try and put words into the center of your religions mouth, not to mention taking a good deal of liberty with the trinity. \n\nYou just seem to be playing a little fast and loose online with judging others online, ESPECIALLY considering the sub you're in. If you claim to know Jesus so well and everything he said, how can you almost gleefully judge others while dropping a snark-bomb and dripping sarcastic exaggeration at the end? It's amazing to me how many \"Christians\" will skip the love aspect (two biggest commandments given from Christ center on it)  of the religion yet have no problem telling others what they're doing wrong, often in a hateful fashion like this.  It also amazes me that you still think getting into Heaven is works-based, but  discussing theology in a non-bludgeoning fashion doesn't seem to be your strong suit, so I'll leave you to figure out that on your own one day.

"I have two major recommendations: Keith Green's music was honest, blunt and catchy whilst being musical (he was a considerable talent on the piano) - try some of his songs on YouTube.

He also made some worship albums and folk albums from the more \"Christian mainstream\" genre - interesting, but not as good."

"&gt;Not exactly the way you think you are. You use circular reasoning to validate scripture with itself. You try to validate a passage with that very passage, which holds no more support than something anybody would write saying that God said something. The gospels are the only stories that corroborate each other.\n\nThe Gospels are no different in that respect - you are using them (the bible) to validate itself. The Bible does prove itself to be accurate throughout the scriptures not just the gospels so I'm pretty sure you are using a poor understanding of scripture. \n\n\n- It is not circular to use Matthew to prove Genesis (Matthew 19:3–6, cf. Genesis 1:27, 2:24), Paul to prove Luke (1 Timothy 5:18, cf. Luke 10:7) or Peter to prove Paul (2 Peter 3:15–16).\n\n\n- It is also not circular to use Jesus’ clear statements to prove the Bible. His statements such as, ‘Scripture cannot be broken’ (John 10:35) and the repeated ‘It is written … ’ show that for Jesus, what Scripture said is what God said. Indeed, Jesus defended many of the doctrines that skeptics love to scoff at (see quote below). Even without accepting Scripture as the authority, many liberal theologians believe that there is overwhelming historical evidence that Christ affirmed biblical inerrancy, although they disagree with Him. Yet Jesus proved His credentials beyond doubt by rising from the dead (cf. Acts 17:31). This independent historical evidence breaks the circle.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------\n Jesus affirmed the reality (historicity) of the following people and events, the targets of your skeptical and inaccurate comments:\n\n-    Matthew 19:3–6, Mark 10:5–9—God created Adam and Eve as the first man and woman, ‘from the beginning of creation’, and this was the basis for marriage.\n\n-    Luke 11:51—Abel.\n\n-    Matthew 24:37–39—Noah and the Flood (Luke 17:26–27).\n\n-   John 8:56–58—Abraham.\n\n-   Matthew 10:15; 11:23–24 (Luke 10:12)—Sodom and Gomorrah.\n\n-   Luke 17:28–32—Lot (and wife!).\n\n-    Matthew 8:11—Abraham, Isaac and Jacob (Luke 13:28).\n \n-   John 6:31, 49, 58—Manna from heaven.\n\n-   John 3:14—Moses and the bronze serpent.\n\n-   Matthew 12:39–41—Jonah and the great sea creature (vs. 42—Queen of Sheba).\n\n-   Luke 16:31 and John 5:46–47—Moses as inspired author of the Pentateuch.\n\n-   Matthew 24:15—Daniel the Prophet as author of the book of Daniel (citing Daniel 9:27).\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nHonestly you don't understand what you are saying and are only causing more confusion when you conveniently throw out books of the bible because you don't understand them. \n\n&gt;We have therapies and stuff for people that have mental issues that don't let them feel things. Regardless, we couldn't just let someone murder, but homosexuality doesn't harm anyone, so this entire thing is moot.\n\nSince you equate the actions of those \"mental issues\" to homosexuality, maybe homosexuality is a mental issue itself or a genetic flaw either way it's your own personal opinion that Homosexuality harms no one. In defining words, context determines the meaning. Likewise, the context of homosexual acts is equally important. The pro-homosexual community wants to separate the act from the deleterious effects. It is like saying that the behavior of jumping doesn't harm anyone. Well, that depends. Jumping in your living room shouldn't harm you, but jumping near the edge of a cliff can. \n\nBehaviors always have contexts and homosexual activity is in the context of 1) a redefinition of sexual morals, and 2) its accompanying promiscuity. When you redefine sexual morals in a far more loose manner, consequences follow - such as an increase in promiscuity and disease.\n\n2% of U.S. population is gay yet it accounts for 61% of HIV infection:  \"Men who have sex with men remain the group most heavily affected by new HIV infections. While CDC estimates that MSM represent only 2 percent of the U.S. population, they accounted for the majority (61 percent; 29,300) of all new HIV infections in 2009. Young MSM (ages 13 to 29) were most severely affected, representing more than one quarter of all new HIV infections nationally (27 percent; 12,900 in 2009).\"  (Center for Disease Control, cdc.gov/nchhstp/newsroom/HIVIncidencePressRelease.html)\n\n\n\"In their study of the sexual profiles of 2,583 older homosexuals published in Journal of Sex Research, Paul Van de Ven et al. found that \"the modal range for number of sexual partners ever [of homosexuals] was 101–500.\" In addition, 10.2 percent to 15.7 percent had between 501 and 1000 partners. A further 10.2 percent to 15.7 percent reported having had more than 1000 lifetime sexual partners. Paul Van de Ven et al., \"A Comparative Demographic and Sexual Profile of Older Homosexually Active Men,\" Journal of Sex Research 34 (1997): 354.\" (See more statistics on Promiscuity at http://www.carm.org/statistics-homosexual-promiscuity)\n\nHomosexuality and reduced Lifespan is also something else you might want to take a look at, it goes counter to your personal beliefs on that subject. \n\nIf homosexual sexuality does not harm anyone, then why are the statistics for homosexual AIDS percentages so much higher than the heterosexual population? Again, there is a connection between the redefinition of sexual morals, the increase of promiscuity due to that redefinition, and the proliferation of disease due to the promiscuous behavior. As I said earlier, actions always have contexts. Why would reality ever be a mute point?\n\n&gt;Jesus never told us to read anything, actually. We chose what to put in there after and decided it was good to read it.\n\n\nConsidering the bible is a repository of Jesus' words the need to read the bible should be obvious. Actually since Jesus is the word of God \"Logos\" who created both OT and Greek Scriptures, \n\nJesus said (in the gospels) that taking in the knowledge of God meant everlasting life he obviously approved of the OT because he used them to teach yet you know better... and somwhow this makes homosexuality acceptable? \n\nTaking in the knowledge - today there's only one way to do that..read the bible. \n\n&gt;I never said it was genetic. I said it wasn't a choice. I believe it comes from something with the paternal figure in life, but that doesn't make it a choice. Environmental things still affect personality permanently. Gay people do not choose and they would be very angry at you to hear this stuff.\n\nGay people do choose and there are ex-gays that say so, not just I. \"The paternal figure in life?\" Does this apply to pedophiles, those that might choose small farm animals  \n\n\n\nHomosexuality isn't treated any differently then say, adultery is, they are not looked down on nor should they be hated or abused, but like all category of sinning or sinners, it's those \"practicing sin\" that we are not to associate with. If you want to get married to someone of the same sex no Christian has the right to stop you as long as Caesars laws permit - that doesn't override laws that God has put into place. We don't judge it but we can see where it leads when talking about having a good or any relationship with God. If you are intentionally disobedient there is no relationship you can have with God. \n\nWhat religion are you practicing again (serious question)?\n\n"
"I suspect it's more complex than that, even.  \nI come from an evangelical background, where there's an emphasis on choosing to accept Jesus as savior, and that ability to choose becomes a strong emphasis in the culture. Mental illness, therefore, falls into that mentality. If you just chose to give it to God, you wouldn't have it. Of course, this is, as you said, one-dimensional and not thought through very well, but I find that's par for the course for much of humanity.\n\nI get the feeling that mainline Protestants actually do a better job dealing with mental illness due to the attempt to integrate modernist science with theology in more liberal theological circles. I haven't read any myself, but I understand Schleiermacher tried to do some work with this.\n\nAs for Catholics, I may be painting with a broom here, but I suspect that for many, there's an emphasis doing the sacraments to obtain grace, which can turn into following procedure. Therefore, mental illness is seen as cured by the sacraments or right behavior if you're just regular and faithful enough. Of course, RCs are so diverse that this is only one subset, and I could be entirely mistaken on it. Knowing a few RC psychologists, I suspect that another subset of Catholicism actually does reasonably well dealing with mental illness.\n\nIn any event, for many Christians, there's a culture that resists seeing mental illness as being something difficult to resolve. The addition of psychology's supposedly anti-Christian roots (as if Christianity has never taken anything non-Christian and attempted to redeem it...), as you noted, makes it even harder. You're talking about changing something that has deep roots in the individual subcultures. Ironically, changing Christians' ideas about mental illness may require a similar prescription to dealing with mental illness itself: time, patience, experiences of self and others, honesty and openness, love and compassion, and the willing cooperation of the individuals involved."

"Two things I find really interesting about this passage. \n\n\n\nThe first is that the people in Hades (not Gehenna) can see and talk to those at Abraham's side. I'm not sure if people who take this story to be a complete portrayal of the afterlife will also believe those in hell can have conversations with those in heaven. If one says the conversation is a metaphor, why can't the chasm also be metaphorical? \n\n\n\nSecondly, especially from a more Calvinist soteriology, can't God bring people to repentance after death? We all are born on the wrong side of a chasm, and God saves us from the other side of the chasm. You say we can't repent after we've died, but aren't we all dead to sin before God's grace? If God can bring spiritually dead persons back to spiritual life, then physical death shouldn't be an issue for omnipotence."
"Well, \"Rosicrucianism was associated with Protestantism, Lutheranism in particular, and the manifestos opposed Roman Catholicism\" ( [source](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosicrucianism) ) and the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn is an  \"organization devoted to the study and practice of the occult, metaphysics, and paranormal activities\" ( [source](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermetic_Order_of_the_Golden_Dawn) ), so yeah, if these allegations are indeed true, they would be prohibited under canon law for Catholics to join."

"I've lived with this fear before too. A fear that my life could be over at any moment, leaving so many dreams and ambitions behind. A darkness set over my mind and all those things that brought happiness fell over like cardboard cut outs. Prayers turn from love letters to a savior, into desperate shouts at an empty darkness. \"Is he even there? Does he hear me? Why would someone who loves me let me go through this? Has he abandoned me? It's because of *activity* I did last week, that's why this is happening.\" This only created more self loathing and using sin to escape temporarily. But that wasn't my end, and neither is it yours.\n\nFirst know that you are good, even at your worst, you are still good. When we choose to follow Jesus, the Holy Spirit becomes a part of us. Because of that, we have access to the things of heaven. Access to goodness, holiness, righteousness, and plain freaken awesomeness! These things are just there for the taking because he's given them to us.  Now for me, I don't think of myself as Justin, the sinner saved by grace. I think of myself as Justin, son of god, prince of heaven, who stands for righteousness in the face of corruption, who reaches out and loves the unloveable, and who is a force to be reckoned with. Because that's what I see my father doing. So now, who are you?\n\nMy point is just that, no matter what your name is, or what you've done or haven't done. Because you believe in Jesus and accept what he's done, you matter and your live has a purpose. The creator of the universe has written the story of your life, and it's going to be epic! It might not feel like it, but our feeling don't change reality. Believe in yourself."

"You seem to be purposely misunderstanding me.  I recall an interview with N.T. Wright where he mentions how he would meet people at Oxford who would tell him that they didn't believe in God, and he would reply \"which God don't you believe in?\"  They would be surprised a bit, and then explain their problems with God, and he would reply \"oh, well I don't believe in that God either.\"  The problem is not that these people don't believe in God, it's that the God they grew up with was not believable, so they decided that this meant they didn't believe in *any* God."

"Hey.  I'm an atheist from a very deep Christian family of southern baptists...I'm also gay.  My family found out about both at around the same time.  I was about 19 and I am now almost 37.    Here is the thing: There isn't really anything you can do at all.  That may sound blunt, but it is the truth.  \n\nI remember the disappointment in my family when they learned that I don't think the things they believe are true.  I feel it to this day.  It is crushing. I'm sometimes filled with despair knowing we believe the universe is organized in totally different ways and that it creates a massive barrier between us that will never be able to be crossed.  In other words: I know your pain and I'm sorry you are feeling this way. \n\nHowever, most atheists are atheist precisely because we *have* studied hard, and looked, and prayed and found nothing at all from the supposed realm of the supernatural.  That was certainly my situation.   If you brother is like this (and it seems to be that he is), there really isn't anything that can be \"done\" about it.  \n\nPerhaps god (if he *is* real), would take special notice of someone who no matter hard hard they looked, found no evidence of him.  Why would god punish someone like that?  It doesn't make any sense does it? If I were a believer, that is the only solace I could take in all of this.\n\n  "

"Just let him be, keep praying for him, and demonstrate as much love for him as you can. That's what my family did for me. If they had tried to push me to believe, I would have resisted with everything I had. I needed the time to work through my doubts. I came around and am now a doubt-filled believer trying my best. Your brother may never come back, but if he does, it will be through the love you show him, not through nagging and fights."
"Fellow Kansas Citian here and I pretty much totally agree with this assessment. Don't forget about the [Sex Cult Murder](http://news.yahoo.com/sexual-community-murder-charge-tied-international-house-prayer-174800830.html) that happened a couple years ago with people associated with IHOP"

"Yes it does help. Thank you for putting up with me. I know I must seem dumb. But I have a torrent of feelings going through me at the moment.\n\nI don't know if I believe he can save me. If I did I guess I wouldn't be having this conversation. But I do want to be saved.."
"Interceding for people on earth.  "
"Exactly, after death comes judgement, but this passage does not say that the judgement is to a permanent state. \n\n\n\nI think the issue of repentance after death might just be one of those questions scripture never speaks to, with people making arguments that it either is or isn't, going beyond what scripture expressly says."
"[Complexity can arise from simple, inanimate systems, naturally](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xpxj1b_the-secret-life-of-chaos_tech). Not all artists leave their signatures on their works and some also go to great lengths to reproduce the images or shapes of things they see to such high degrees of accuracy that they are practically indistinguishable from the real thing.\n\nThis means that complexity isn't indicative of intelligent design. Complexity can exist with or without it.\n\n&gt; Living things on this planet have boundaries. DNA is the mechanism used to stay within these constraints.\n\nHow does DNA stop an organism from evolving too far? What are these constraints? Why do we have fossil records showing organisms that are local to each other geologically and chronologically, that appear to show transitions between completely different species? [Like whales?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_cetaceans)\n\nWhy do whales and [sirenians](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirenians) have finger-bones, elbows and vestigial pelvises, along with a fossil record full of other organisms that show a clear transition between them and land animals?"
"&gt;but this passage does not say that the judgement is to a permanent state.\n\nthere is no where in scripture that says that judgement is temporary."
"&gt;that could convince me that God is real is if he reaches out to me personally\n\nInterestingly, that's what happened to me. Perhaps you just are listening or paying attention to what God is trying to do in your life.\n"
"But see, my problem was, I was raised Arminian (God loves all men and wants them to be saved) but became convinced God's love is undefeatable (anyone who God loves will be saved). We both agree Jesus died for all people, but I go one step further and say that the blood of Christ is never wasted."
"Of course I don't mind and I don't think you are different. The problem is you are trying again to \"know\" if He can save you putting your faith in your understanding when in fact you need to put your faith in Him outside of yourself. Not relying on your feelings to determine if you have faith, rather using them to identify why you don't."
"Strawman.\n\nYou believe in the Big Bang, I presume?  I do too, you might be surprised to discover.  In science, there is one basic rule that all other rules fall under: cause and effect.  For every scientific principle, there is some cause behind every single effect.  Would you agree?\n\nSo, if there was all this matter, and it was super, super compressed, and then this super compressed matter ball exploded and slowly over time, particles began to form, then gravity pulled these particles together to form various heavenly bodies, etc. ...well, where is the cause behind the matter that existed before the Big Bang?\n\nThis is not the same thing as invisible and nondetectable.  This is realizing that there are things we don't understand, but recognizing that there is a cause for everything, and so positing the thesis that there must be some cause behind all that is in the Universe.  You think it's absurd that I believe that there is some rational being that is the cause behind the effect of the matter of the Universe that was involved in the Big Bang.  I think it is absurd that you believe that matter is God.  That matter arranged itself in rational ways and has existed for all of eternity.  I think this is absurd."
"I've always thought that it's because the metalcore/metal scene is stereotypically NOT christian. A lot of guys get saved and have that background and because it's a passion, they want to be a light in that scene. Total guesswork, but it makes sense in my mind at very least."
"I would invite you to check out Starflyer 59.  Most of their lyrics are not overtly Christian, but they are indeed Christian.  Just a great band in general:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_3GVZX0mMU\n\n\nAlso perhaps look into OM.  I'm not sure if they're actually Christian, but they are very influenced by the ancient spiritual traditions.

"Objective evidence."
"Yeah, that makes sense."
"It can be resisted for a time, absolutely. I can't remember who made the analogy (Probably C.S. Lewis) about the chess master playing a novice. The novice may take a few pawns (resist God for a while) but the chess master would never be defeated.\n\n\n\nAlso, I'm thoroughly enjoying this discussion! Just thought I should note that."
"Have you heard it's criticisms?"
"But I mean.. How do I put faith in him outside myself? I read a Billy Graham article about this. He said that the people that think they're self sufficient may never be able to enter the kingdom of heaven. I identify with that. I've always thought of myself to be self sufficient. \n\nHow do I put faith in him? I know it seems like such a simple question. But after trying to be saved twice and still not understanding, I think if I knew how I'd have done it already."
"&gt;Objective evidence.\n\nSuch as ?"
"I'm certain I haven't heard them all"
"&gt;It can be resisted for a time, absolutely.\n\nFor me... the lack of any scripture talking about people who are in hell, coming out of hell, and then going into heaven, indicates that it is not possible.\n\nAfter all it would be pretty important scenario"

"The problem is there is no objective way to know if it was God teaching it to you, or an emotional reaction that was subjectively interpreted by your mind as not coming from yourself.\n\nThe brain is a horribly unreliable instrument, it makes mistakes all the time and constantly tries to make sense of those mistakes as if they were not mistakes at all, but that's just how it has to work to be useful. \n\nSome people experience things and immediately attribute them to supernatural/external influences. Others simply think \"that was strange, I wonder what that was and what caused it.\""
"Matthew 25 is certainly a problematic verse for universalists. Eternal means all sorts of things, it's hard to pin down for sure. In Jude verse 6,7, eternal is used to describe temporal things [Jude 1:6-7] (hopefully I did verse bot right, I've never used it before haha).\n\n\n\nUniversalists take it to mean \"age enduring\" \"pertaining to an age\" or \"that which comes from God\". Each of these can be used consistently with Matthew 25. \n\n\n\n"

"Remember, the nature of health insurance has changed. The \"old\" model is that you buy insurance based on your needs and what you can afford. The \"new\" model is based on the idea that we as a society are better off if people have access to health care. So, as a society, we are better off if women have access to good health care \rwhile they're pregnant. So, instead of just women between the ages of 18 and 40 paying (which makes it more expensive for everyone), the idea is to have everyone chip in. So, nuns may not need it, but then, neither do men, and men are required to pay in for this service as well. "
"Scripture is silent on lots of things. I don't find it fair to just say that the absence of evidence is evidence of absence. It's an argument from silence that must be avoided."
"Physical evidence of supposed miracles. \n\nStatistical difference in the health/longevity of a group of believers outside of other controlled variables.

"&gt; The problem is there is no objective easy to know if it was good teaching out to you, or an emotional reaction that was subjectively interpreted by you mind as not coming from yourself.\n\nActually, it's quite easy, for me over a period of several weeks God kept reaching out to me, to the point I was left with the 100% conclusion that it was God.\n"
"Absolutely one can ask. But that doesn't mean you are entitled to the type of response you want. "
"Sure, but I wouldn't gain anything from believing in God, and especially not from joining a organized religion. If I were to become a spiritual man, it would be a personal relationship with God and nothing to do with church or anything like that."
"Maybe, but you'd assume that he'd make the signs a bit more obvious if he's really hell bent on convincing me."
"Well here we are again, me trying to figure out your perspective as to what determines or constitutes as \"real\". Yet for fear of me being called one whom uses \"straw man\" tactics, I will press on hoping to guess where your standards lie :). I must admit though it is amazing to me how people have certain demands or rules that God must follow to show Himself to them yet they are unwilling to abide by there own. Sorry for my \"rabbit trail\"..... Let us start with the sun, are you able to see it? are you able to touch it? or is it in fact the photons of its light that you see and feel? It is interesting to note that Jesus said His followers are the light, and the path/rule God in His infinite wisdom has chosen is to be manifested by His people motivating them with a most excellent task. However we do see in history what happens His Holiness comes close as we read in Exodus about Mt. Sinai, what is even more interesting is to see the unhelpfulness this path/rule works as the Israelites built a calf in a very short time. You see, wisdom begins with fear, but ends with love, and this journey God has revealed through His word."
"This is where we're going to differ..\n\nAnother example is that the bible doesn't explicitly forbid celibate same-sex relationships, yet because the bible always talks about marriage in the context of one man, one woman; we can say that celibate same-sex relationship are not permissible. \n\nThus, as the bible talks about eternal (as in for the rest of all time) punishment, it is not possible to accept Christ and be saved, whilst being in the \"eternal suffering and punishment\"."

"&gt;Maybe, but you'd assume that he'd make the signs a bit more obvious if he's really hell bent on convincing me.\n\nThere is a area of scripture that talks about a man who is in Hell, pleading with God to send his family a sign..

"A: *reliable* such is thin\n\nB: that is just \"God of the gaps\" - if something unusual or unexpected happens, it is not sufficient to say \"ah, God\". Something unexplained is: unexplained.\n\nC: Even unlikely things (spontaneous remission etc) happen with predictable statistical frequency. This is no more miraculous than somebody winning the lottery. Very unlikely to happen to any given individual, but pretty common when considering a large population.\n\n(edit) D: the ugly elephant in the room - a lot of such have subsequently been exposed to be simple fraud or (more generously) recording / diagnostic errors"
"Doesn't he have to roll a save? He may have the healing forced upon him."
"The problem is, all you're doing, is saying that the Bible is silent on an issue, and then appealing to the majority position as the one we should side on. It's an argument from silence, and it should be avoided because it is easily defeated with a simple reductio ad absurdum reply.\n\n\n\nThis is where we will disagree, I don't believe the bible speaks to eternal punishment (punishment in Matthew 25 even means \"correction\" in the Greek).\n\nEdit:spelling"
"Broken bones do heal naturally, cancers do go into spontaneous remission naturally, people who have been in wheelchairs for a long time do become able to walk again naturally (e.g. If they were wheelchair-bound due to spinal cord damage, sometimes that damage can continue to heal slowly over a long time)."
"So basically, what you are saying is that there is no evidence that you will accept."
"No objection. \n\n&gt;Lawful Therapeutic Means\n&gt;\n15\\.

"Sure, but it seems a little presumptuous to write a rough draft before you even read the post..."
"Repentance means to change the way you think and act. You will need to repent of your thinking, which in fact is thinking you can fully understand Him. Ask the Lord to forgive you for putting your power of understanding over His power, and trust that He is able to hear you and believe in Him that even though we are not faithful He is faithful. It is your heart that is condemning you not Him if you just believe."
"That's still not an objective way to know. You simply *don't know* that these experiences were not manufactured by your brain. Consider that people of other faiths and beliefs have similar experiences yet are left with completely different conclusions."

"Hi, athiest here, not trying to trash religion or anything, but, if God does exist and he created humans in his image, and a human feels that He isnt real, wouldnt God have made him that way? i mean, everyone has a right to their religion, Christians, Muslims, Jews, but if a person chooses to not have a religion, shouldnt you try to not force one upon him? As long as he doesnt bash your religion, and is respectful to your beliefs, shouldnt you at least offer him the same curtosy? As i type this, i assume you are both at an age where you can make decisions like this for yourselves and not doing it to fit in with friends. This probobly want an easy decision for him to make, it wasnt really easy for me, but i have many friends and family members who are Christians, and we dont bring up religion unless it is an absolute necessity. Again, im not trying to make it sound like God is fake because this is your religion and i have no right to speak slander against it, but i also want to say that it is easy to coexist with someone in your family who doesnt share the same religious beliefs as you. I am sorry if this offended anyone. i truly am. "
"No, that is not what I said. What I said is that it is not sufficient to merely present something unexplained and declare \"God\"."
"I think you're doing exactly what you should do: go up the chain of command. Talking to the Ombudsman is good, as is talking with the director of the facility.

"You, sir, are awesome. My prayers are going out to you, brother/sister!\n\nI would definitely talk to the head of nursing when she comes back, and that way, when you (have to eventually?) talk to the Ombudsman, she can have your back. Generally, it always helps to have \"authority\" backing you."

You may say \"because they have not yet repented\". I would then say that non-repentance is a sin, which Jesus paid for. So then why are people thrown into the fire?

"&gt; It's \"free\" because the costs saved (in theory) exceed the expenses.\n\nBut that simply isn't true. The only case in which costs saved exceed expenses is if you postpose pregnancy indefinitely, which isn't the case. For the small percentage of women who never want to procreate, the cost of contraception has never been an impediment because those who can't afford it can get it for free already. In addition, looking at children as expenses in a country which is currently below replacement rate is very myopic. \n\nFinally, the \"free\" that is being spoken about is the fact that the contraception coverage was not going to increase the cost of their polices. So, as I said, whether someone has contraceptive coverage or not, they are paying the same price for their policy."

"Jesus references those as stories for parables that people of the time will understand.  It would've been a tough sell to come in and tell everyone the true nature of the universe, especially when they had no scientific way of seeing it like we discovered within the last 100ish years.  Evolution is virtually a fact.  Regardless of what's in the Bible, we have quite solid evidence for it.  People that believe in young earth creation and disbelieve in evolution will fade away.  There is simply no way to support it.  We know about how old the universe is.  We know dinosaurs existed millions of years ago and not just through carbon dating.  We know evolution happens as strongly as we know WWI and II happened.  If you want to hold to a literal interpretation of events, you are going to have a bad time.  The Bible is either straight up incorrect or Jesus was using those as a reference so the people would understand.  Those are the only two options.\n\n&gt;If homosexual sexuality does not harm anyone, then why are the statistics for homosexual AIDS percentages so much higher than the heterosexual population? Again, there is a connection between the redefinition of sexual morals, the increase of promiscuity due to that redefinition, and the proliferation of disease due to the promiscuous behavior. As I said earlier, actions always have contexts. Why would reality ever be a mute point?\n\nThe fact that they have a higher incidence of these things is based on personality traits of the person.  There are many homosexuals that have loving relationships no different to straight people.  Just as there are a plethora of straight people that are way promiscuous.  Sexuality itself is a byproduct of how someone is raised.  There wasn't mention of all these diseases in the other cultures in history that were primarily bisexual.  \n\n&gt;Gay people do choose and there are ex-gays that say so, not just I.\n\nAgain, anyone that loses their homosexuality, was never really gay in the first place.  There's far more stories of how trying to un-gay someone made them hate themselves and others.  Even the people that came up with the psychology stuff behind turning someone straight have since said they were wrong and are terribly sorry for the whole ordeal.  I dare you to walk up to a married gay couple and say these things.  See if you don't get punched in the face or at least laughed at with a sad head shake.  Also, I did not equate homosexuality to a mental disorder.  I was in fact saying it was not, but rather a product of environment.\n\n&gt; \"The paternal figure in life?\" Does this apply to pedophiles, those that might choose small farm animals\n\nPedophilia actually can be a learned trait, as again there were several cultures that practiced this stuff.  We as a culture have decided it is wrong along with stuff with animals.  Whether these people have a mental disorder or not is a matter of debate, but it doesn't matter, because we have all decided it is wrong.\n\nPeople like you are going to fade away.  Your views are not supportable by science and not loving, but excluding.  I think we're done here.  You're in for an uphill battle that you're never going to win and it's going to blow up in your face one day.\n\nI am a BioLogos guy, btw."
"Read it again"
"If you're talking about after the millennial reign of Christ, I believe that is when Heaven meets the renewed earth and we reign over creation with God.  \nBetween then and now I have no idea."

Heaven is not some place in the clouds where we all float around with wings and halos.  Heaven is the new Earth where God will dwell among us and I imagine there will be plenty of stuff to do...and explore."
"&gt; such as the fossil record \n\nAccording to Don Prothero, a well known paleontologist and ardent critic of intelligent design, the fossil record \"one vast monument to stasis, with relatively few cases where anyone had observed gradual evolution\".  In his [Skeptic Magazine article](http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/12-02-15/#feature) he describes how the stasis is real and not merely a product of inadequate sampling, \"I could point to this data set and make the case for the prevalence of stasis without any criticism of bias in my sampling\".  So I don't see how the fossil record supports common descent?\n\nI don't think it supports YEC either because you would expect a global flood to deposit cetacean fossils in the cambrian with other marine invertebrates, but we only find them much higher up."
"&gt; This means that complexity isn't indicative of intelligent design. Complexity can exist with or without it.\n\nComplexity can exist without intelligent design but it must be believed by faith. Complexity can exist by intelligent design but it too must be believed by faith. The point made, is just because there are similiarities in DNA between humans and animals it does not automatically mean they evolved from one another. It is not the only theory. \n\n&gt;How does DNA stop an organism from evolving too far? \n\nThere are checks and balances within the genome. It's so complex and intertwined that a mutation in one single area can cause deformity, sterility, or death. \n\n&gt;Why do whales and sirenians have finger-bones, elbows and vestigial pelvises, along with a fossil record full of other organisms that show a clear transition between them and land animals?\n\nThe pelvis is used for reproductive support. Finger bones, and elbows would be for some type of support as well.\n\nThe supposed transitions between land animals and whales I find to be childish. Children have great imaginations. It's story telling. I can do the same thing:  \n\nrat -&gt;  mouse  -&gt; bat           That's all they are doing with whales. They take a land animal with 4 legs. Lose the legs and gain a huge tail.\nThe same with a bat. The rat loses 2 legs and gains wings. \n\nIt's superficial. Look deeper and you find this is impossible. DNA makes it an impossibility. "
"&gt; vestigial organs\n\nWe creationists agree that evolution is primarily a destructive process, so broken organs are expected.  You should read [Vestigial Structures Exist Even Within the Creationist Paradigm](http://ncse.com/rncse/30/4/vestigial-structures-exist-even-within-creationist-paradigm), published in the NCSE's journal--a source that is very hostile to creationism.

"Thank you. You have been incredibly helpful to me.\n\nI still feel deep down that it can't be that simple.

I can't tell sometimes if God is trying to tell me something, or if it's my own fears and doubts."

"&gt;Strawman.\n\nRemind me again how that's a strawman?\n\n&gt; For every scientific principle, there is some cause behind every single effect. Would you agree?\n\nGenerally, yes.\n\n&gt;well, where is the cause behind the matter that existed before the Big Bang?\n\nI don't know of anyone who knows that answer. No one has ever witnessed the birth of a universe before.\n\n&gt;This is realizing that there are things we don't understand, but recognizing that there is a cause for everything, and so positing the thesis that there must be some cause behind all that is in the Universe.\n\nHold on there. You just said there are somethings we don't understand. Yet you're willing to apply this thesis to something we don't understand? Seems like poor reasoning to me. Who knows? It might be that birth of our universe is the exception to the rule. I don't know.\n\nBut if everything has a cause, then what created God?\n\n&gt;You think it's absurd that I believe that there is some rational being that is the cause behind the effect of the matter of the Universe that was involved in the Big Bang. I think it is absurd that you believe that matter is God. That matter arranged itself in rational ways and has existed for all of eternity. I think this is absurd.\n\nThat's the best part. The universe doesn't care what you find absurd. You're willing to jump to conclusions about things we don't and might not ever understand. **That** is what I find absurd. \n\nI don't believe matter is God. I find it interesting that you're willing to even suggest that I, or anyone else would think so. Now **that's** a strawman. Matter is matter, nothing more, nothing less."
"I've struggled with many of the same questions. I've had mental health issues for most of my life. I won't get into the specifics here, but suffice it to say the list of diagnoses and medications is not short. I constantly find myself wondering how it affects my spiritual life. \n\nMany of the symptoms of mental illness are in direct opposition to the things that the bible says Christians need to be and do. Jesus even said \"On the day of judgement people will give account for every careless word they speak.\" If so, I'll be there a while.\n\nIf I have a physical condition, an actual chemical imbalance in my brain, that keeps me from doing the things that Christians are supposed to be doing, does God take that into account? I tell myself that His mercy will cover it, but then I wonder if I'm simply making excuses for what amounts to a severe lack of discipline.\n\nI wish I could tell you that I had an answer for you, but I don't. All I can tell you is that I am here with you."
"I believe that Christianity is more about the journey and the relationship building rather than the destination.  I have struggled for a long time(and continue to) with what I think God wants me to do.  I think that struggling is key part to being a Christian.  In fact Israel means wrestle with God, and that is what Israel does all through out the OT.  Christianity will always be a struggle so keep fighting it was never supposed to be easy.  What separates me and you from my bro is that he has stopped wrestling. "

So ya its for his own good."

"&gt;I must admit though it is amazing to me how people have certain demands or rules that God must follow to show Himself to them yet they are unwilling to abide by there own.\n\nWe're only human, right?\n\n&gt;Let us start with the sun, are you able to see it? are you able to touch it? or is it in fact the photons of its light that you see and feel?\n\nYou can see it. \n\nWe aren't able to touch it, because we'd get vaporized if it did. But, if there were some way to resist that kind of heat, I'd imagine we could.\n\nYou can see and feel the photons, as well.\n\n&gt;It is interesting to note that Jesus said His followers are the light, and the path/rule God in His infinite wisdom has chosen is to be manifested by His people motivating them with a most excellent task. However we do see in history what happens His Holiness comes close as we read in Exodus about Mt. Sinai, what is even more interesting is to see the unhelpfulness this path/rule works as the Israelites built a calf in a very short time. You see, wisdom begins with fear, but ends with love, and this journey God has revealed through His word.\n\n...what?"
"&gt;The universe doesn't care what you find absurd.\n\nI find it amusing that you posit that perhaps matter spontaneously appearing out of nowhere is an exception to the rule, accuse believers in some kind of deity to be absurd, *and then* personify the universe itself....\n\nWhich is basically what I do as well, in a sense - I'm a panentheist, so I believe that whatever God is (which is not something I can claim to understand, nor can anyone), God is a cosmic being whose very \"cells\" are the galaxies themselves, and yet transcends this matter, much as a human being transcends their own matter (we are not merely chemical reactions, but somehow consciousness is more than the matter and chemical reactions that make up our body)."

"Cause and effect only really works within the scope of space and time, which didn't exist as we understand it before the Big Bang.\n\n&gt; I think it is absurd that you believe that matter is God.\n\nBut he doesn't.

"Clear evidence that almighty God can do anything!"
"Yeah, but the problem is you have to receive some form of movement and that's where things get stuck. If you have a lot of faith, you can accept, alright I have to be where I'm supposed to be, because I believe it.\n\nBut if after weeks, months, years, decades your still in the exact same spot and you fail to see any change/movement (everyone has a different breaking point) then (while absurd to try and think like/for God) I do think that asking God for a bit of light on the path is justified. Ask enough with no response and it's human to respond with, this doesn't work. (Again I realize if we could think like God, we wouldn't be having any of the messes we have currently)\n\nLike I said, in a current situation as your brother. I fear that if I don't get some light on the path soon...my faith will eventually break as well. "
"&gt;I find it amusing that you posit that perhaps matter spontaneously appearing out of nowhere is an exception to the rule\n\nI was merely suggesting an alternative idea. The last statement I made was I don't know.\n\n&gt; accuse believers in some kind of deity to be absurd, and then personify the universe itself....\n\nYou're really reading into that too literally. Let me rephrase: The best part is that it doesn't matter what you believe; the universe isn't affected by it. The universe doesn't abide by our very whim. You can believe the Moon is made of cheese, but it doesn't make it so."

"&gt; chimps  .... Smithsonian about Genetics and evolution ... \"study of the same aspects of the chimpanzee genome indicates a difference of about 1.2%\"\n\nI reject this because I see others in peer reviewed literature doing the same.  For example [here](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/06/19/1201894109.full.pdf)):\n\n1.  \"It is now clear that the genetic differences between humans and chimpanzees are far more extensive than previously thought; their genomes are not 98% or 99% identical ... One consequence of the numerous duplications, insertions, and deletions, is that the total DNA sequence similarity between humans and \nchimpanzees is not 98% to 99%, but instead closer to 95% to 96%, although the rearrangements are so extensive as to render one-dimensional comparisons overly simplistic\"\n\nCreation geneticist Jeffrey Tomkins did his own comparison using BLASTn and came up with a number [closer to 70%](http://www.answersingenesis.org/articles/arj/v6/n1/human-chimp-chromosome) and cites two other creationists who arrived at a similar figure.  I don't know whether it's 70% or 95-96% but I know Smithsonian's website is wrong.  The 1.2% difference comes from only counting nucleotide substitutions in sequences that align, and ignoring indels:  the parts that are only in one species or the other."

If you can accept Pascal's Wager as a realistic reason to believe, that leads you to a point where you have no choice but to believe just about everything on the same grounds.\n\n**Belief is not rewards-based:**\n&gt;The argument relies, to a certain degree, on the belief being genuine, and not simply feigned.\n\n**Non-zero cost of belief:**\n&gt;One flaw with Pascal's wager is that it makes the false assumption that belief costs nothing, and lack of belief provides no benefit. This is not the case.\n\n**Non-zero payoff on non-belief:**\n&gt;The Wager also invokes the assertion that non-belief will not be rewarded in any way.\n\n**Appeal to emotion, fear:**\n&gt;Pascal's Wager fails to provide or describe any hard evidence that hell or god exist, or that non believers will go there. Instead it relies on a fallacy of relevance known as appeal to emotion"

"Pascal's wager is more useful in deciding if one wants to say they believe in God. It will confirm to believers that they have made the correct choice, but does nothing to convince unbelievers.

My family never pushed me to be religious, but they also didn't refrain from talking about their beliefs or displaying their faith in front of me either. They didn't look to create the situations, but when they were around each other, they were praying and talking about God as usual, and I think that helped to bring me back.\n\nI guess I would say don't push, but don't walk on eggshells either. It was my family's natural display of authentic faith that helped."

"&gt; no one actually rejects God. They reject flawed, limited human constructs of God.\n\nIn order to reject God one would need to believe in God. Also many atheists would propose that the limited human construct is in fact the totality of God.\n\nImagine your belief in the existence of God. There are people with an inverse disbelief in the existence of God. This disbelief is not a sign of immaturity in one's faith, just that maturity has lead someone to a different conclusion than you."

As such I personally do not trust it as a reliable means for discovering truth.  \n\nAnd the experiential evidence of one person is hardly going to motivate me to accept  their religion over any other. The experience of one follower will often times contradict another followers. So again I personally would not trust it as a reliable means for finding truth.\n\nIf it helps you to understand what an atheist would find as acceptable evidence for your god, ask yourself what you would find to be acceptable evidence for another religion's god.

One either understands and accepts them, accepts alternate evidence and denies them, or does not understand them.\n\n&gt;well, where is the cause behind the matter that existed before the Big Bang?\n\n&gt;That matter arranged itself in rational ways and has existed for all of eternity.\n\nThis is a really flawed understanding of the big bang. But anyways, the first cause argument could be made in the same manner for God. What created God? What was it that caused God to exist? \n\n&gt;This is realizing that there are things we don't understand, but recognizing that there is a cause for everything\n\nMost atheists would agree with this point.

When some stands in the pulpit and denounces homosexuality they usually do not have to address it personally.

When people do things that are contrary to the law of God then I tell them so. This is OUR (yours and mine) obligation to Christ as Christians.\n\nBut anyway, like you have done to me from the start, I will also write you off in the knowledge that for 16 years you have applied biblical theology with such a humanistic slant that it is beyond my ability to reason with you through the cornucopia of your bad presuppositions.\n\nSuffice it to say, I agree with you on your last point, that you and I are clearly at different points in our Christian walk, and that each of us needs to continue working out our own salvation with fear and trembling.

"People always criticize me when I say I want to beat people like that with a stick. It's just a saying.

You are not alone... not just as a person with depression, but even if you can't feel it, God is with you. He has never left you. I speak from decades of experience."
"&gt;You follow an accusation of a strawman argument with a strawman argument. It is a false equivalency. Scientific theories and principles do not require belief.

Have you personally seen the evidence that scientists say proves various theories?  Have you personally examined all of them and decided that they make sense and that there couldn't possibly be any other explanations for this evidence?  If not, then you are believing things.  Also, there are plenty of scientific theories that are quite simply our best guesses at the moment and will most likely change with time.  For example - take a look just briefly at what scientists say about black holes, and then take a look at why they say this, and you realize that it's all guesswork.  Black holes are a profound mystery to us.  But we believe they exist.  Why is it so different for me to believe in God but to admit at the same time that God is a profound mystery that I can't claim to be able to explain or understand?\n\n&gt;This is a really flawed understanding of the big bang. \n\nI was obviously trying to summarize.

I also believe that there is truth within all forms of belief, though they have not united themselves with the source of truth - the various religions are a bit like the tendrils of a galaxy: they are unique but are all slowly being drawn to the source, and as you get closer to that source, they are not so different after all."

"You don't seem to get what I'm saying.  We have to agree on what, exactly, the definition of \"God\" **is** before you and I can communicate.  I am saying that one aspect of \"God\" - perhaps the most important one, and the one I would like to focus on for the purposes of this discussion - is that God is the source of all matter and life in the universe.  You, as an atheist, would probably say \"the Big Bang is the source of all matter and life in the universe\".  So I would say that you believe in God, and your God is an impersonal God who is merely the collection of all matter that somehow resulted in matter forming itself into more complex arrangements and somehow spontaneously resulted in life, which we can't really explain since we can't seem to understand how it is that there is a difference between a living being and a computer."

"You don't get it.  And the main reason, I think, is that you don't want to.  You merely would like to remain comfortable from your lofty heights judging people who believe differently.  I am saying that believing that there was no cause for the matter that ended up being part of the Big Bang is as much of a belief as believing that there was some being who created that matter.  I am saying that if you say that the Big Bang is the source of all matter in the Universe and all life, then your God is the Big Bang and is an impersonal God.  But you say \"no, I don't believe in God so that's not God\", and I say \"but if God is defined as the source of all matter and the source of all life, then yes you **do** believe in God, and your God is an impersonal glob of matter that exploded and somehow randomly resulted in life, which we still haven't been able to explain as we can't really understand why a living being is somehow different from a computer....\""

"&gt; This is not so. Have you personally seen the evidence that scientists say proves various theories? \n\nDoesn't matter if I have seen it personally or not. The evidence exists.\n\nLet me put it another way. Do you believe in Napoleon? Have you seen and held proof that he existed? If you wanted to you could travel to his tomb. Visit museums and read what he wrote with his own hand. See galleries with pictures of him painted from life and so on. \n\n&gt;Also, there are plenty of scientific theories that are quite simply our best guesses at the moment and will most likely change with time.\n\nYou are misunderstanding what a scientific theory is. A scientific theory is most certainly -not- a best guess. A scientific theory summarizes a hypothesis or group of hypotheses that have been supported with repeated testing. If enough evidence accumulates to support a hypothesis, it moves to the next step—known as a theory—in the scientific method and becomes accepted as a valid explanation of a phenomenon.\n\n&gt; For example - take a look just briefly at what scientists say about black holes, and then take a look at why they say this, and you realize that it's all guesswork. Black holes are a profound mystery to us.\n\nWhat scientists say about black holes is based on observable evidence. Black holes are a profound mystery to *you*. You could choose to learn about them if you so desired.\n\n&gt;I was obviously trying to summarize. No need to pick apart my very, very quickly thrown together summarization.\n\nIf you are basing you belief structure on such a flawed characterization, hastily thrown together or not, I would propose that such a structure is flawed. Your belief should not require a misunderstanding of science to be valid."

"I agree that micro/macro are arbitrary, and I also agree that speciation happens all the time and is an observable process, but typically involves either the shuffling or loss of existing functions.  I put the limits of evolution at about the genus or family level, so that's what I'm happy to call macroevolution :P.\n\nWhat I disagree about is whether the rates of evolutionary change we observe are adequate to extrapolate all of biology coming forth over the last 4 billion years, or even something as \"small\" as the divergence of humans and apes.  In the last several decades we've observed evolution in numerous microbial species from every domain of life, and in populations of up to 10^20.  HIV took a population of 10^20 all mutating random combinations to evolve a few new binding sites, malaria (p falciparum) 10^20 before finding the right two nucleotides to flip to gain chloroquine resistance under strong selective pressure, and all other examples among all these species species are as slow or slower.  Yet among about 10^12 ancestors since a chimp divergence, millions of times fewer mutations and selections than the microbes, we would've had to evolve something like [280-1400](http://justpaste.it/2l26) new genes/proteins through duplications, fusions, de novo from non coding DNA, and some without homologs at all.  These are members of over 20 new gene families and are found active in our neocortical development among other areas, and have little to no homology to existing genes.  Humans aren't alone here [since](http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/5/2/439.full) \"orphan genes ...  typically make up 10% to 30% of all genes in a genome\"\n\nAttempting a crude quantification, that gives homo a million times less mutational search but a thousand times the result--meaning we would have had to evolve new genes/proteins a billion times faster than any observed rate.  Observation tells us functional variants are too rare and it requires vast mutational search to find even very small gains.\n \n"

But just like scientists say that there is evidence for the existence of the Big Bang, and yet can't claim to understand how the Big Bang works, and maybe perhaps it wasn't a big bang even but might have been a black hole or something...well, same thing with God.\n\n&gt;You are misunderstanding what a scientific theory is. A scientific theory is most certainly -not- a best guess. A scientific theory summarizes a hypothesis or group of hypotheses that have been supported with repeated testing. If enough evidence accumulates to support a hypothesis, it moves to the next step—known as a theory—in the scientific method and becomes accepted as a valid explanation of a phenomenon.\n\nDo we understand what exactly a black hole is and how it works?  As soon as you say \"no\", but state that the theories we have are different than religion, you are a hypocrite."

"Once you start examining various religions with an open mind, you find they all seem to have quite a lot of resonances.  I've focused mainly on the similarities between Christianity and Buddhism, myself.  But there are various theologians who have studied the similarities between Christianity and other religions.  I was just reading about [Bede Griffiths](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bede_Griffiths), who was a \"Christian yogi\"."

"What questions do you have? Sometimes God uses other people to tell you what he wants you to hear. But that can't happen if you don't ask. I think there are more than a few people here willing to listen and help in any way they can."
"Its not just a knowledge its an experienced knowledge, Its not just any book it is a book that passes on a quantitative and qualitative level which no educated/ reasonable person would deny. Yes there are some textual differences, yet the fact they are being corrected even proves its power. The God I know is not just some fiction There is a nation raised up by Him and is still here today, there is no denying this. There is a Son whom nobody denies his historical existence, and eyewitnesses that can be traced back from this day. Now you can say everyone is hallucinating, but when you are the only one it would be wise to think maybe you are the one who is wrong. Not only that but even the idea of atheism although as lofty as it is, scientifically speaking comprise of only 2% of the worlds population which on an humiliating level fails quantitatively. Not only this, but the superficial stance of I can't see it then it doesn't exist stance or the absence of evidence is evidence, leads only to an illogical conclusion, there must be no God there must be no atom there must be no quarks, and here we see another failure on a qualitative level. Does this help?"

"Have you ever studied astrology?  Ever heard about how astrologers have discovered that when you construct a map of the known universe, it [looks a bit like a sponge](http://tetrahedral.blogspot.com/2011/02/sizing-up-universe.html)?\n\nWhat I've been trying to get at with all the atheists in this thread who jumped on me is that we have to agree on what the definition of \"God\" is before we can communicate.  I believe God is the source of all matter.  I believe God is the source of all life.  I believe God is actually a being - like you or I are beings.  Now, if you believe in the Big Bang but say you don't believe in God, I say \"au contraire - you **do** believe in God, but your God is the Big Bang, and has no personality.\"  Now, if we work with the definition I've given, is it really so absurd to say - hey, if God is the source of matter and the source of life and is a being Himself (I *really* wish English had a pronoun that didn't have sex), and we know that the Universe looks like a sponge, is it really so absurd to think that maybe we (as well as all matter in the known universe) are just part of an enormous life form of some sort?"
"&gt;Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places, even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him. In love he predestined us for adoption as sons through Jesus Christ, according to the purpose of his will, to the praise of his glorious grace, with which he has blessed us in the Beloved. In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace, which he lavished upon us, in all wisdom and insight  (Ephesians 1:3-8)\n\nGod's election of sinners is the basis for and the force behind salvation.  There are none who are regenerated who aren't elect and there are none who are are elect and are not regenerated.  Election is the beginning of the processes of salvation described in Romans 8 which is irresistable and cannot be thwarted.  \n\nGod's election is based on His sovereignty and His decision to redeem a people to worship Jesus as a display of the Father's love for the Son.  \n\nElection is merciful and gracious because we all were condemned to eternal torment in hell as a result of our sins.

"I dont agree with OP, the son is not the father.\n\nSorry. I believe in the Trinity, and the Trinity believes in separate persons. \n"
"To me, it is the only possible conclusion when reading Scripture.  Romans 8:28-30, Ephesians 1, along with many other passages (raising of Lazarus, hardening of Pharaoh's heart, opening of Lydia's heart, etc.)  clearly show how God elected people since before the world began.  \n\nMany people seem to think this violates some sort of free will God granted us, but the problem is the passages that seem to support this view are pretty weak.  Of course there is far from a simple answer, but I would recommend listening to Shai Linne's song [Election.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qhwfmMyYnI) It's actually quite well done."

"&gt; I here this so much... my question is what evidence would the average atheist accept ?\n\nWhen there isn't a need for interpretation or 'listening' or 'softening of the heart' etc.  It simply is.\n\nReality is just that.  If your god was real, your religion would not exist.  He/she/it would just be a normal part of life and existence for *everyone*.\n\nIf you need a book to explain it and there are other books explaining other versions of their god(s), it underscores the human origins of the myths.\n\nAlso for that same reason that you learn about religion in church or whatever specific religious study organization instead of a normal history class.\n\nBecause again, if it were real, it would simply be a part of our history, not a religion."
"Where in Scripture does God clearly give us free will?"
"Yes, I agree with the Nicene Creed, which clearly distinguishes three persons, and does not confuse the three persons.

For the longest time it never rustled the feathers that anyone cared about."
"Election does not negate free will. Free will is the ability to do what you desire most. Everyone is absolutely free to do what they wish. Because of sin nobody wants to seek God. So they do not."
"My confusion with election is: why evangelize? If God has elected his own, without cooperation of man, why do we spread the gospel? Shouldn't election mean that God does the spreading, not us? If there is no cooperation or free will of man to choose Christ, why did he command us to \"go, therefore, making disciples of all nations\"? Why does anyone have to make a \"personal decision to accept Christ\", then, if it is not by free will?"
"Scripture doesn't. The Bible and the Church Fathers make it pretty clear in my opinion that God is love and desires that all men be saved.\n\nThe doctrine of election just strikes me as the sign of an insane deity who creates beings he then ordains for damnation to eternal torment while claiming to love them and desire relationships with them all while rendering such impossible."

"&gt;But Haggard said that his past was still impacting his life.\n\n&gt;In the end, the former megapastor claimed that his Christian training was delivered by people who didn’t respect the mental health and neural science professions. This translated, he wrote, into a counterproductive situation, as he was taught to view all issues as being entirely spiritual in nature.\n\nThis makes me sad. I can see people in my own congregation saying he just didn't believe enough or that he wasn't trusting God with it. I heard Christine Cane of Hillsong church this week say that you're not in need of a miracle if you don't save/tithe/use your money correctly. That you you need money management help.\n\nI see this in the same vein. If there are mental health issues at play, it bothers me that (some) people won't advocate for the individual getting help for those."
"Pray for him an show him Christ. Best thing you can do. "
"Keep praying. Keep loving. You have no control over what he believes, and you cannot by force of reason or otherwise convince him of Christian faith. Simply trust that he is in God's hands, being of faith that God's hands are trustworthy and true. You will be surprised of the ways grace and mercy that will flow out of his life as a witness to who God is and what God is doing with him."
"That's a highly uncommon belief among Christians."
"You realize that because your hypothesis doesn't deny the existence of vestigial organs, that is not proof for your hypothesis? It is however evidence for evolution over time.

What you're doing is saying ya they have femurs, \"but God did it.\""
"Through the Holy Spirit, those in heaven become aware of all those on earth, and through the Holy Spirit they pray for them and help them. \n\nBut they do so with love, they do not try to impose or force, and if they meet any resistance they meekly withdraw. \n\nIf you open yourself to the love of the saints, you will be greatly blessed. "
"I believe that too often, those who insist on election are forgetting that God is outside of time. He is perfectly capable of knowing who will freely choose Him and acting to use that choice.\n\nAlso, I cannot comprehend how Peter's statement in 2 Peter 3:9 that God desires all to come to repentance is compatible with the idea that He is glorified by only allowing some the opportunity. If He wants all to repent, is He not strong enough to allow them to?\n\nThe only intervening force that I've found between that statement and universalism is a belief that there is something He desires more. But if Free Will has already been discounted, you're forced to believe that God is most glorified by people not being saved because He chose not to save them, even though He wanted to. It doesn't make any sense to me."

"We all fall short of keeping his commandments. People can struggle with homosexuality and still love Jesus with all their heart. It all comes down to whether or not they give into the temptation. I personally struggle with Pornography and yet, I choose to not give into the temptation. Because I struggle and sometimes fail in resisting, does that make me not love Jesus any less? Of course not! We are human by nature and we are saved by our Faith, and not our ability to keep the Law.\n\nHowever, because we love Jesus, we should strive to keep his Law, even though we all will fail in the process."
"I believe that when a soul sees its Creator and still chooses to persist in rebellion, the will of such a creature is irreparably broken. Those in Hell can never again choose to love God, they have chosen to lose that choice."

"I think it is clear the God gives us free will all of the way back at the beginning with Adam and Eve.  The choice they had whether to obey or  not to obey God's edict with regard to the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil.  God did not force them one way or the other.  It is much the same way for us now.  We have the choice whether to accept the grace that God has given us through the death and resurrection of Jesus.  He is not forcing us one way or the other, but watches over us like a loving Father who will guide us but not force us.  "
"And yet, the Prophets identify what's speaking to them as the name, not as the Holy Spirit. I'm not sure that holds up."
"[Ephesians 2].\n\n&gt;And you were dead in the trespasses and sins in which you once walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience—  among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind. But God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us,  even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ—by grace you have been saved— and raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, so that in the coming ages he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.\n\nThis isn't so much that God *denies* us Free Will, but that by virtue of our sinful nature, we do not will or desire to do the things that God would have us do.  There is no cooperation in conversion apart from the Holy Spirit, there is no preparation before conversion apart from the Holy Spirit, it is instead the job of God to 'make us alive together with Christ'."

[**8**]  For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, [**9**]  not a result of works, so that no one may boast. [**10**]  For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them. [**11**]  Therefore remember that at one time you Gentiles in the flesh, called \"the uncircumcision\" by what is called the circumcision, which is made in the flesh by hands- [**12**]  remember that you were at that time separated from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world. [**13**]  But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ. [**14**]  For he himself is our peace, who has made us both one and has broken down in his flesh the dividing wall of hostility [**15**]  by abolishing the law of commandments and ordinances, that he might create in himself one new man in place of the two, so making peace, [**16**]  and might reconcile us both to God in one body through the cross, thereby killing the hostility. [**17**]  And he came and preached peace to you who were far off and peace to those who were near. [**18**]  For through him we both have access in one Spirit to the Father. [**19**]  So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God, [**20**]  built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone, [**21**]  in whom the whole structure, being joined together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord.

"First, you dodged my question.\n\nBut to answer, Pharaoh didn't have free will in responding to Moses, Lazarus didn't have free will when Jesus chose to raise him from the dead, and Lydia didn't have free will when the Spirit worked in her heart (Acts 16).  But since this is probably not going to be enough for you, here's some more Scripture supporting election:\n\nActs 13:48 - \"As many as were ordained to eternal life believed.\"\nRomans 9:11-13 - \"As it is written, Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.\" (Woah, God hated someone!)\nRomans 11:7 - \"The elect obtained it, but the rest were hardened.\"\n1 Thess 1:4-5 - \"he has chosen you...\"\n2 Thess 2:13 - \"God chose you from the beginning to be saved...\"\n2 Tim 1:9 - \"called us with a holy calling...of his own purpose...\"\n1 Peter 1:1 - \"to God's elect...\"\nRevelation 13:7-8 - \"every one whose name has not been written before the foundation of the world in the book of life...\"\n\nAgain, it's far from a simple issue, but I still can't find scripture that supports free will.

"This is what most people have a problem with when it comes to election.  Like /u/Kidnapped_David_Bal4 said above, election is not God's ordination for eternal torment, but the undeserved magnanimous saving of sinners.  The idea is that because of sin we're God's enemies and that in our natural state we're spiritually dead and hate God.  Our eternal punishment is the just reward for a lifetime of sinning against the supreme being, the infinitely valuable One.  Left to ourselves with no election not a single person would repent of their sins as Romans 3 describes.  Had God not elected anyone there would never be repentance and salvation.\n\nSo the function of election is to regenerate and save, not to condemn."

What is the purpose of the Son (as in the second member of the Trinity)?  To be glorified above all else in the world (Col. 1, Phil. 2).  Therefore the fall of man was necessary for the glory of the Son since that was the only way the cross would ever be necessary.  It's actually quite beautiful how God chose to use sin, the epitome of everything He hates, for the ultimate supreme glory of his Son."

"He foreknew what they would choose.\n\nWhat do you think it is that He knew? It can't just be that they'd exist, He knew that about everyone."
"I believe Jesus was claiming divinity. \n\nHe was not claiming to be the person of the Father, or the person of YHWH.\n\nI believe the person of the Father and the person of YHWH are the same person. \n\nI believe Jesus is a different person than the Father. "
"&gt;For instance, Christians claim that prayer works. Prove it. If it does work it should be very easy to prove.\n\nThis doesn't work, because God is a being that would be aware of the person trying to prove it and would more likely not show.  He's not a set of reactions that always occur."
"God did not cause Adam and Eve to eat that fruit.  It was a choice that they made.  They choose to disobey God's orders much in the same way that we do everyday.  I do not believe that God caused Adam and Eve to eat the fruit just so Christ could be glorified, but I believe that God caused Christ to be glorified because He knew we could never choose to get it fully right.

" Life is good right now, and I'm grateful for what I have. Been the most difficult year of life so far, yet the most blessed. I look back and smile seeing how I've grown characterly and what I've learned. Tears were shed in pains in the moment, but are now shed in joy for the growth they caused.\n\nIdk, I'm happy and I just want other people to be happy. I've been in darkness, and it's no place to be. And sadly the words to others can put people in those dark places. Humanity is me if I had a separate life with differing circumstances. Thanks though! Your thoughts of saying I'm  kind perks my spirits up! All compliments are kindly received!"
"Is there any Christian house music?"
"The problem with your analogy is that God doesn't send us to hell. It is our sin that does. Yes God is love, but he is also just, so sinful men must be met with punishment. God cannot go outside of His character, lest He no longer be God. "
"The issue is that absolute proof denies faith.  If we all knew that God existed for a fact, there would no longer be any reason to live any other way.  All of our growth would stop.  We'd become automatons.  Along these lines is also the reason I figure we have different interpretations of the word."
"I think perhaps there was cross contamination? Something fishy. Since every other dinosaur bone that has ever been dated shows that it is millions of years old.

"If a house is to be built, and you know that a nail will be hammered into a block of wood, why pick up the hammer?  Because the means have been destined just as much as the result.  God elects souls to be saved, but he also elects those to go and save them.  Romans 10:14-15, \"How then will they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how are they to believe in him of whom they have never heard? And how are they to hear without someone preaching? And how are they to preach unless they are sent? As it is written, How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the good news!\"\n\nAnother way to look at it is like this.  There are those from every tribe and every nation that are a part of God's elect, and God has blessed us with the task of bringing them into his kingdom (Matt 28:18-20)."

"Why not learning, understanding, being overcome by and glorying in who God is and all He has done? Plumbing the depths of His creation, learning how it was made, maybe making new things, communing with Jesus, learning His perfection, exploring the possible, learning to heal the damage done to earth, body, and soul, administering to the millennial kingdom's denizens with love and justice and power, in likeness with the Savior? Contemplating the intricacies of creation, of the finely wrought path of each life, of the word written with YOU in mind, of all the times life happened the way it did as a direct intervention of Jesus Himself on your behalf...   \n\nSo much possibility.

"So God caused them to sin.  I disagree with that because I do not believe that God influences us to commit sin.  I believe that they made the conscientious decision, due to the serpents temptation, to reject what the Creator had stated.  I do not believe that it was God's will that this would occur.  I believe He knew that it would occur, but did not physically cause it to happen.  Just because I know something is going to occur does not mean that I am influencing its occurrence. "
"I totally agree. That's because there are more dumb Christians than dumb atheists. But I still think that atheists, for the most part, place too much confidence in beliefs that they have not studied thoroughly. Conversely, Christians are even more guilty of this.\n\nAnd I'm not trying to be condescending. I will readily admit that I have not studied enough. That is why I am not so dogmatic and unwilling to admit the possibility of error."

"The way God talks about it in Isaiah, and again in Romans 14 and philippians, seems to me to be *much* more than acknowledgment.  It seeems to point at the fullness of Gods victory."
"No, he knows they will not.  The passage in Romans 8 is not dealing with those people, only those who will be saved.  That's why I'm saying you're misreading it.  Here are those three verses again, \"And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose.  For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers. And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified.\"\n\nThe passage is talking about those whom God chose to elect, those he \"foreknew\" and he chose to call them, justify them, and glorify them.  There is nothing in that passage that even hints that we have any say in whether or not we are called, justified, and glorified.  Look also at Ezekiel 37."

"Cursing at others is completely not allowed.\n\n"
"No, God did not cause them to sin, sorry if I made it sound like that.  Scripture is very clear that no sin ever comes from God.  But it was most certainly God's will to allow that sin to take place.  If it wasn't, why didn't he stop if from happening?  It was God's will to use the fall as the beginning to the ultimate glory of the Son."

Went to church camp every year, afterwards becoming a Cabin/Activities Leader. Went to Bible College and studied the New&amp;Old testaments. \n\nHow did I become an atheist? \n\nWell I also love reading about space and nature and there came a point where I couldn't learn more without it conflicting with my religious beliefs. I decided to approach everything with a more open mind even if I didn't agree with it and guess what? Slowly science made more sense and a god made less sense. This happened over the course of a few years until I had to make a decision: Which am I going to accept as true now that everything I've learned/experienced with my religion directly conflicted with everything I've learned about nature/science.\n\nNow looking back, I can't even believe that I used to be a Christian. While I hold nothing against my Christian friends and I still go to church occasionally, religion just seems so silly to me. It's an eye-opening experience to look at the world for what it is and how it came to be and how everything coexists and to know that there isn't a god behind it all. I find real awe in that."

"&gt; Faith aside, my second point could be a foundation of her beliefs that can be very difficult to shake. If we take away all matters of faith and biblical &amp; prophecy history, she still has experiences, feelings of joy, and other beneficial things in her life that she all attributes to her NT faith. She wouldn't want to leave the very faith that gave her a new fulfilling life.\n\nI am assuming that at one point (probably early on when it was still new), she got those positive feelings from Mormonism too. Your 2nd point was mainly that it's different this time because the conversion came from a family member and not a stranger door to door missionary, and because the OT foretold Jesus and not Smith. The latter is moot because the mormons have all sorts of ways to interpret verses to place Smith in there as the prophet and savior next to Jesus. As for the difference between missionaries and family members, I don't see why it matters *who* leads you into the faith, it's the faith itself that matters. \n\nAnd I doubt she would have joined and stuck with Mormonism for 20 years, unless those feelings of joy, experiences, and other beneficial things she attributed to it were also occurring, at least they must have at some point to keep her there. \n\nI just think that no matter how you slice it, the way she jumped out of Mormonism and into Protestantism illustrates the fragility and malleability of faith and personal religion. For me, instead of her story illustrating how she now has left the \"wrong\" side and joined up with the \"true\" side, she's only further perpetuated the notion that religion is nothing more than personal bias and emotion.

No matter how highly you can imagine the best of all possibilities, heaven will continually far surpass it all. No one will be disappointed in the barest degree.  Hope as high as you may, heaven will astound. The most sublime experience this world can offer will pale to insignificance next to a moment in heaven. God can be trusted to deliver. If he says it is beyond imagining, imagine your highest, then assume you know nothing compared to the real. Beyond compare. "
"The place people go to when they die- Sheol, hell, the grave, the realm of the dead, whatever we want to call it, has never changed.  \n\nWhat has changed is what happens *after* this.  Christ has shown us that there is something *after* death-resurrection.  To new life.  Your body, but different.  Having passed through death, we then are judged.  That's when people will go to \"Hell\" hell, the lake of fire, the outer darkness, the second death. Whatever we want to call it.  Meanwhile, those in Christ shall inherit the eath.  The new earth, that has, much like us, passed *through* death and merged with \"heaven\", the Kingdom of God, the realm of God.  Whatever we want to call it."

"Thanks for sharing. It seems like your way out of the faith was intellectually valid considering the circumstances.\n\nBut I often find that this kind of approach can lead one to throw the baby out with the bathwater. It seems that you lost your faith by finding more and more contradictions between science and the Bible. I fear that many people have lost their faith this way when they didn't have to. The problem is a house-of-cards faith (remove any condescending connotations). If one card is removed, say a literal Adam or Biblical inerrancy, the entire thing collapses. I find that a Jesus-centred faith is much more robust. You can lose a literal Adam, you can lose inerrancy, you can even lose Biblical inspiration, but you do not have to lose Jesus.\n\nIf you're interested, I'd suggest reexamining Christianity from a Jesus-first approach. Did Jesus exist? What did he teach? What did he believe about himself? Was he God? Did he die on a cross? Did he rise again in 3 days?

"I think that these things were created through Christ as God.  \n\nI think God knew what would occur at the fall, but that does not mean He changed His purpose.  God has the unique view of history where He can see it from beginning to end as one big story while we only see it in fragmented parts.  I do not claim to know the mind of God by any means.  I believe though that God allowed human nature to dictate the course of history and acted accordingly."
"Why is it a problem if it's not used in a problematic way?"
"I'm not actually sure that prayer does anything now or that any miracles have occurred other than the resurrection.  Assuming they do, though, it's certainly possible that a scientific observer could interfere with the prayer's likelihood of occurring, depending on the prayer.  I mean, if someone prays for strength, it'd be hard to see whether or not they got it.  Something more overt, though, could be avoided because of the observer's attempt to prove God.  I figure if prayer does work, this is the reason overt things generally don't happen.\n\nWe are actually supposed to pray alone, though:\n\n&gt;But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you."

"If you read my first post you would know that I am an atheist.\n\nA book isn't a great way to spread your message. God chose a tribe of ancient, barbaric middle eastern people to write down his law. It's pretty much a formula for disaster and contradictions.\n\nAnnihilationism is a Christian minority view, not shared by the majority of Christians. Many denominations have different views of Hell. Yes, you could say that Annihilationism is similar to my view where when we die we cease to exist, we go into a metaphorical \"oblivion\"; none-existence. We cannot be aware that we are unaware. But it is still viewed as punishment, as there is a \"better\" option out there; to believe in an invisible sky daddy for which there is absolutely no evidence for, and you get to go to heaven where you will eternally worship him. Or maybe eternally play trumpets. Or have sex. Or just kinda...exist. Heaven isn't described very well.\n\nHowever, most Christian denominations believe in an eternal punishment, the Hell of torture and separation from god. It is used as a threat, to control the masses. Annihilationism is a little less dramatic, a little less harsh, but still has that same message; believe in god, accept Jesus into your heart, or not live forever. But if Annihilationism is in fact true, I won't know it. I will cease to exist. There won't be any punishment for me. That is no different from the reality of death, where you actually do cease to exist.\n\nI won't care that I don't exist anymore. I won't be aware that I don't exist anymore. Nobody will be able to tell me, \"Ha, I was right, moron!\" I won't exist...*at all!* Annihilationism then, in my opinion, isn't really that scary. If I don't choose to worship god and Jesus, I cease to exist, big deal. I won't even know I don't exist or that I chose wrong. I won't know that I'm missing out on heaven.\n\nYeah, heaven sometimes seems like a cool place. But honestly it just seems like a fabricated piece of nonsense used to either control the masses or give comfort to people when they are faced with the harsh reality of the existence; that the universe doesn't care whether or not we are \"living\", and that when we all eventually die, we cease to exist, and the universe continues to move regardless. \n\nOnce you realize this, your current life becomes much more important than just a massive test to see if you can live a second life."

Take Paul for example he never married and he was perfectly content he I'm sure ministered to single Christian women his own age but he was cleansed of his lustful idolatry. God can make us like that so we can devote our whole life to his Gospel. I mean think about it this world is just a temporary place ultimately. We will all die and meet the Judge. Wouldn't it be a better perspective to just say to Jesus you are my husband I want to live for you and be your hands and feet and live a life that's going to be worth living. Paul i believe in 1 Cor said I wish all men were as I am (unmaried) I think God is pleased when men come to Him with that perspective it's showing Him that you want to be used by Him.

"First off, there is no denying that there is a doctrine of election, election is spoken of many times in the Bible. OP asked for your view of election, which would mean how do you interpret those verses. Do you believe that God chooses people because he knew that they would choose him in the future, or that God chose people who would never have chosen him on their own and made them to follow him, or maybe something else?\n\nSecondly, you have indeed shown that the scriptures do show that humans have some degree of choice, but that is not necessarily at the center of the election debate. I believe that all of the decisions I have ever made were indeed my decisions. But, I believe that before the Holy Spirit regenerated me, I would not have chosen to follow God. It is all by God's grace that I am justified and it is all by a faith given to me by God that I choose to follow him. There are more extreme versions of Calvinism, of course, but that is not the center of this debate."
"Right - so we try to believe things that are true. Christians think we have good evidence that Jesus is God in the same way that you have evidence that Obama is president. We think the Greeks were wrong about their beliefs (inasmuch as they believed them; the Greek and Roman religions weren't that tied up in orthodoxy as compared to orthopraxy; if you sacrifice to the gods, it doesn't matter that much whether you believe they really exist or not).\n\nI'm not sure what you're asking?

Thanks for the suggestion.\n\nEDIT: P.S. I'm not saying that a man named 'Jesus' who amassed a following did not exist, I just do not believe in the immaculate conception, the miracles and the resurrection story."

"He owes us a chance because it's his nature as a fair, merciful and loving God who by those attributes would offer that chance. We think we're unworthy but it's the story of the Bible that God loves us still and would send his own son for us in order to reconcile us to him. I would argue that the image we are creafed in cannot be burried completely even in the most dire of circumstances as shown by the book of Job or the story of Jonah or Jacob or any of the many cases in the Bible where people choose God against what may appear to be common sense. How can mere humans overcome the ability of God to craft us as his own. But of course since we're both believing contradicting axioms you would simply say those people were predestined to come to God. I'm not going to deny that it would be consistent with those stories much like free will but I don't understand how for instance to book of Job teaches us anything if Job was destined to make it through temptation in the first place."

Does this have anything to do with pharoahs individual salvation?  Imo it does not.  Likewise Christians are also Gods people he predestined to have a full revelation of the nature of Gods grace and mercy.  Does this mean all Christians automatically are saved?  Imo not necessarily, there's a lot of scripture that I believes supports the idea that how we respond to receiving the gift of salvation can have soteriological ramifications."

"&gt; 24 He who does not love Me does not keep My words; and the word which you hear is not Mine but the Father’s who sent Me.\"\n\nActually none of the bible is from Jesus, it is all from God the Father. And it is all in the effort of bringing people through a transition and in it revealing many types and shadows to help bring a greater understanding of the whole of what God desires of us. God never changes but he has only been able convert us with baby steps those steps continue from Genesis to Revelations and Jesus was just a part in continuing to reveal what was not revealed to us yet, because it was not yet possible, until he made a perfect sacrifice for us to receive grace and the transforming power of the holy spirit in us to become a new creature in Christ, by dying to the old nature and becoming alive to a new nature.\n\nThere's absolutely no reason to believe that any standard of morality in the bible has changed though, every moral issue in the bible is direct from God if we believe the bible to be the true words of God, if not, then we have nothing, nothing to live by."

Therefore, they are designed.\n\nTo break this inference you would have to show another mechanism capable of #1, or show that biological systems don't contain complex, specified information.

"I don't think you actually understand what \"good\" evidence is. For me, it would be objective, repeatable under controlled conditions, and scientifically-based. A \"healing church\" and a movie don't count. Has the prayerful healing occurred under double-blinded conditions and studied by scientists? Nope.\n\nThink of, for instance, the amount of evidence for a new drug before it is approved by the FDA. That's the level of evidence most atheists are asking for. The funny thing is that there is no such evidence for the Christian god. There is literally more evidence that tylenol works than there is for a god, let alone any specific god, because tylenol has had to undergo numerous tests for effectiveness and safety under rigorous double-blinded scientific tests.\n\nBut that's not to say that ideas about Christianity haven't been tested scientifically. They have. And so far they have failed. The most recent example I can think of is the study on intercessory prayer which took over a decade and involved close to 2,000 patients.

If we only looked at his wrath and justice we'd see a scenario where God owes us nothing except for eternal suffering and separation from Him.  And election is not talking about why Jesus, came, but rather the response to his coming.  As for Job, again as I said earlier, the doctrine of election does not remove free will.  Only the free will to choose salvation.  All other actions and choices we make are our own, although we operate within God's divine will.   "

From the [paper](http://www.newgeology.us/Dinosaur%20bones%20dated%20by%20Carbon-14.pdf):  \"Both [the triceratops and hadrosaur] bones were tested by a licensed lab for presence of collagen. Both bones did in fact contain some collagen. ... Dr. Libby, the discoverer of Radiocarbon dating and Nobel Prize winner, showed that purified collagen could not give erroneous ages.\"\n\n&gt; Since every other dinosaur bone that has ever been dated shows that it is millions of years old\n\nWhat other bones have been dated?  Most techniques other than carbon dating (K-Ar, U-pb, etc.) date the rocks above and below them, not the bones themselves.  Amino acid racemization dating (another direct technique) would also put them hundreds of thousands of years or less because these same bones contain many original dinosaur proteins).  I'm not arguing for YEC here--there are good arguments both for and against YEC--such as order in the fossil record.  My only argument is that the data is in conflict and therefore the best position on the age of life on earth is agnosticism :P"
"That isn't what I said. I don't know why you are so upset, but there really isn't any basis for reasonable conversation if you insist on making up straw men."
"You can't force someone to believe. I loved God, prayed twice a day and loved, absolutely LOVED my Catholic boys school growing up. I'm now pretty much an anti-theist despite my deepest desires in wanting God to exist. \n\nYou simply can't make someone accept that which their heart themselves cannot accept. \n\nAlso, if I might add, saying \"pray for him\" is a bit rude, although given that this is /r/Christianity and that you are a Christian, I do get where you're coming from. "
"*Jesus Christ Superstar* had aspects of this."
"Pascal's Wager, in the words of anyone who has actually studied any theological subject, is the worst argument for the existence of God (not that it really is one), but it's absurd. Even my evangelical friends at uni despise it being used in arguments by religionists. "
"I think it's fine if you want to follow your conscience in that way.   However, if you want to be consistent with your conscience, also consider boycotting coffee, chocolate, electronics with rare earth elements mined in central africa, gasoline and other oil products, shoes and clothing produced in sweatshops, and so on."
"What about those people Christ preached to while He was dead? Are all people who died without faith because they never heard damned as well? If fate is \"sealed\" at death, they must be.  But I don't think that is the case.  \n\n&gt;Can I live for Satan?\n\nYou must understand that there is no purpose in doing so, and that the consequences for doing so would be most severe.  I would not recommend it, Christ strongly warned against it, and He also provided a way out of that lifestyle through the Holy Spirit of God, who is real and powerful.  If you are struggling with a desire to do this, I encourage you to bring it before your church family.  Our faith is communal, and we must help one another."
"I don't believe in any type of God, deity, whatever. So I don't think that'll happen. "
"You seem also to believe God made your sister as a gay person, because he does that, because some people feel this way and God doesn't make mistakes. Yet there seems to be the assumption that her girlfriend which God mistakenly made a female, needs a sex change for her girlfriend that is attracted to females not males?????????????????\n\nWhat??????????????\n\nAll I wanna say is God does not make anyone gay, practicing it is against word of God and it is part of the fact that sin lies in the midst of every heart - including believing your gay. But there is the opportunity of change through the grace given us through Christ and the transforming power of the word and spirit of God."

"Again, Jesus also uses parables.  Did the mustard seed literally exist?"
"As an atheist, I think I understand his POV. Basically, I think part of the claim he is making is that it is pretentious because the Christian scripture isn't the only holy scripture on offer. In other words, by claiming that the Christian bible is the word of the all-powerful creator of the universe, you are dismissing all other religions and their texts. Now, I'm sure you have your reasons, but for those other religious faiths, the way you view them is exactly how they view your religion.\n\nAnd even if we knew that one of the world's religious text was perfectly true, because of the sheer multiplicity of mutually-incompatible religions that exist and have existed throughout human history, all religious people should expect to be wrong purely due to probability. What are the odds that Christianity is the one right religion and you just so happen to believe the one correct religion out of thousands? Most people are Christian only because they were born in a Christian culture and were raised within the belief system. If you were born 5,000 years ago in Egypt, you'd be praying to the Egyptian gods."
"As an aside, I've noticed \"I'll be praying for you\" is basically Christianese for \"fuck you\". :D"
"Christ preached to people while he was dead??\n\nBy your logic I can be saved even after death.  If that is the case why does it even matter how I live this life?"
"I'm behind you. Not silly at all, just plain truth."
"no no no, the greek polytheism is just an example or sort. The questions was what is the true difference between greek polytheism and christianity, well nothing really besides the obvious like who worshipped what, what im trying to say is, greek polytheism isnt much different than christianity, so what makes them wrong, and us right"
"My new years was brilliant, thanks **companion**"
"Ok so I come back to the question about fabrics and beards and rare meat and women not speaking in church etc.\n\nI just don't see how someone can say, and I am not accusing you of this, more the concept itself, well yes this rule from the bible applies and is absolute, but that one doesn't and isn't.  Homosexuality is a forever wrong thing, but it is really ok for women to speak in church or not cover their heads, for instance.\n\nAnd I am afraid I must respectfully disagree with you that if someone does not believe the bible is the true word of God they have nothing to live by.  "
"He owes us a chance because he is a just judge and that would imply he has something to judge. Surely you'd agree you cannot be held accountable for something you didn't freely do?  How does God then insure his judgement of us is fair? By ensuring our faith in him (what he judges by) is an action only we are accountable for, not anyone else. By removing free will in faith we are no longer accountable for our faith. How then can a just God punish someone (this is ignoring the fact justice doesn't mean needing to punish) for something they had no control over?\n\n\n"
"One of the premises of election is that without God's intervention, no man would choose God. Therefore, for anyone to be regenerate, God must work first in them.\n\nThe idea of giving everyone a chance sounds \"fair,\" but salvation has little to do with fairness. Sin deserves death. Death would be fair. If not ours, then it must be a death effective to cleanse us of all sin. Christ's substitutionary death satisfies God's justice. We do nothing to deserve the gift of election because it isn't about how good we are, but all about how good Christ is. "
"Amen!"
"My belief in election is as follows: \n\n1. No one deserves salvation. God has judged all men as sinners and no one deserves to be taken out of that category (Rom. 3). \n\n2. God, in his omnipotence before the beginning of the world, knew that all men would sin against him and not desire to truly repent and turn away from their sins towards God (Eph. 2). But God elected some people to regenerate so that they would turn towards him and could be saved through the goodness of Christ.\n\n3. Why God did not choose everyone is a bit of a mystery, but there are some reasons I can put forth. God is love, God is justice, but most of all God is holy (Isa. 6). Apparently, although in some sense God would like everyone to come to him, there is a greater sense in which God knows that for certain purposes he should not bring everyone unto himself, and therefore some people are fitted for destruction (Rom. 9). Perhaps God's justice does desire for some people to come under it, or perhaps there are other greater reasons we do not understand.\n\n4. God elected some people unconditionally (not based on anything in themselves) and then Christ came and died for these people and the Holy Spirit seals them, and brings rebellious people to God (Eph. 1).\n\n5. After this miraculous work of the trinity, people who formerly lived for things other than God (or a god of their own design) people voluntarily choose to follow God. God does not necessarily violate our wills but changes our natures in such a way as to be inevitably susceptible to choose to follow God (John 6).\n\n6. If God chooses someone, they will inevitably come to faith in him, regardless of where they are in the world. Perhaps at times God has worked more through certain nations and peoples than others, but ultimately there will be all types of people in Heaven. I believe that these days there are more Christians coming out of Africa, South America, and Asia than US and Europe, or at least that will be the case soon. But that is not a reason to give up on any people."

"You believe matter popped into existence by itself, and therefore I am arguing that this spontaneous matter **is** your God."
"/r/conspiracy is over there ----------&gt;"
"It's not about what we're worthy of. It's about what God is capable of. If God is capable of saving us all, I believe that He will. It's not what I believe about ME or YOU. It's what I believe about HIM. "
"Its not an argument for existence of God nor is it meant to be. Its the kind of thing to talk to an agnostic person about.   "
"&gt; then there would be no need for faith.\n\nWhich is why you are not finding your evidence... the relationship with God starts with faith."

"&gt; Then luckily you're not in a position to make decisons affecting populations of people!\n\nWhy. Because you don't agree with me? Surely your *opinion* is the edge that makes you superior over others! How shortsighted. Especially considering that you are wrong according to Science.\n\n&gt; No, in science's history there have been cases of people being wrong. What you said implies that it has a regular track record of being wrong more often than right.\n\nThe fact is that Science has been wrong in the past. Also it's a fact that there is no such thing as '*absolute truth*' in science which you have implied. The things you believe now? Very soon they will be obsolete and you know that. \n\n&gt; Your entire argument is trying to say that we've been wrong before, so we are probably wrong now/can never tell for sure, while at the same time ignoring the plethora of evidence that not only doesn't support your claim, goes against it. Sadly I've seen enough of your discussions in the past to know that you will likely never change your mind.\n\n\"Plethora of evidence\". *Empirical* evidence. Evidence that builds on from other hypothesis assumed as *facts* in the first place. FYI I'm educated. I researched evolution. I was taught evolution. I know what I am disagreeing with. You on the other hand assume your beliefs to be superior over mine simply because they are *your* beliefs... And I don't even know if you researched my side of argument enough (probably not at all)."
"The problem with that argument is that it could apply to literally anything. I claim that an invisible dragon exists in orbit around mars. No, you cannot study it because it has magical power and would tweak the data so you'll never find it. Also that's why nobody's ever found good evidence for Bigfood. He's magical and won't show up in the data.\n\nDo you still think this is a good line of reasoning?"
"Actually I was trying to show how he was taking things out of context.  That's what I meant about the Jesus answering a question about a man and his wife.\n\nAnd the rest were pretty much, thou shalt nots, except for the part about women speaking in church, that was from Paul.  I don't really see how I took anything out of context."

"Yes, what does that have to do with my original question?"
"For instance, the old Norse religion."
"Jude 7 uses \"aionion\" just like in Matthew 25, but in Jude it doesn't mean \"never ending\". We know eternal life is never ending because of perseverance of the saints, not because of a translation of \"aionion\". \n\nUniversalists take Matthew mean that the life and the correction take place in the age to come another translation of \"aionion\". But just because these take place IN the age to come, need not mean they occupy the entire age. \n\nPeople who believe in the traditional hell make the same word mean two different things all the time. For instance, Phillipians talks about every voice will CONFESS, but traditionalists say the saved will confess joyfully, and the unsaved be forced to do it. Same word, being interpreted two ways. The traditionalist does the same thing that they charge universalists with."

"Do you wish to damage your relationship with the Creator? Christ gave us a mission on this earth, do you want to follow Him or not? If you want to follow Him, you must obey His commandments.  Preach the gospel, bring the Kingdom of God closer, and love the Lord your God.  Turn from a life of sin, you can be better than that.  You can be better than that through Christ--because of Christ.  \n\nJust because He is saving you doesn't mean you can respond however you like.  If you slap Him in the face, how do you think that will be met? If you deny Him, what do you think He is going to say? There's a point where saving you is painful, reconciliation hurts because you have to get rid of the bad stuff, and sometimes we've clung so tightly to that bad stuff that it feels like giving up a part of who we are. \n\nFor people who have lived their whole life that way, the pain will likely be unbearable.\n\nAnd yes, Christ preached.

"Let's be honest here.  What would the fair judgment be for every one of us be? Easy. Death (Romans 3:23).  God has judged already judged us, and that judgment was death and the out poor of his wrath.  This is of course the point of the cross, to serve as a payment in our place for God's wrath.  The doctrine of election is not about how God condemns some (indeed all were already condemned), but rather how God, in his undeserved mercy and grace chose to save a few.  This is what Scripture seems to support.  If you want to disagree (which is totally fine), you should provide Biblical support for what you believe."

"When Jesus was telling Jews that they were wrong, was it not love? He was telling the Jewish leaders of his day that they were wrong only in hopes that they would turn from their ways, through his example of true righteousness.

To educate myself, I am reading the Q'uran along with my Bible and some parts are very beautiful. There's a lot of similarities between the three faiths and I promote an interfaith dialogue. As long as you still have faith and love and accept the divinity of Jesus, you are absolutely fine.\n\nIn fact, Jesus is revered and honored as a prophet in Islam as Isa ibn Maryam. It is said that the Injil (Gospel) was handed down to him. Arabic-speaking Christians would refer to God as Allah, just as Spanish-speaking Christians would refer to God as Dios.\n\nEDIT: I am not at all saying I believe the Q'uran is true, or accept Muhammad's prophesies as truth. I do not. I am only speaking of how closely the faiths are intertwined and that Islam is a self-proclaimed continuation of the Hebrew Tanakh and the Gospels."

"\"Moot\" means (paraphrased): \"up for discussion\" NOT \"not up for discussion\" read the dictionary. OK on to the topic at hand, most sin is motivated *by* sexual lust. The serpent in Eden (which, is *not* an actual talking snake, it is the Bible's way of poetically speaking) opened Eve's eyes up to lust. The Tree of Knowledge. The \"secret\" behind procreation that they were not supposed to know. Adam &amp; Eve were the fall, that represented/started the Fall of Man. The Fall caused all of the turmoil on the planet to start: animals having to kill to eat, diseases, death, and so on. No \"apple\", no Satan luring Eve, no Fall of Man. I hope this helps? So, the Serpent/Satan opened Eve's eyes up to sexual lust. The Serpent did *not* have sex with Eve (some ignorant Christians believe this!) Satan is a spirit, spirits have no bodies, and cannot mate. He merely \"turned her on\" to sex. Yes, sexual sin is a BIG DEAL and Christians should talk more about it! Not less! Especially concerning couples shacking up, living together unmarried. Seems to me they forgot ALL about that....concerning gays, most people don't like to be advised that what they are doing is a sin. Newsflash! Well, homosexuality is a sin. A BIG sin. It is an abomination to God. Doesn't mean we hate gays. I love them- a lot of them I know are really creative, funny, and down right pleasant. I have never pointed my finger at them to say: \"Sinner!\" We all are. But, I will not compromise and wishy washy my way out of an argument as I see many cowardly preachers and Christian apologists do. I am living in sin myself. \"All have sinned, no man is righteous\" Paul said that. "
"I heartily agree with everything you have said. But I would like to point out that struggling with a sin is different than giving into the sin and making a lifestyle out of it. This is the point at which a person is clearly not a follower of Christ, because they have chosen to make a lifestyle of a sin and they actively support it. So in the context of my original response, the \"couple\" referred to live in a sinful relationship. They aren't struggling with it; they have made it their life. "
"My suggestion is to attend Mass (at a Catholic church) for a few weeks (don't take communion), and if it seems to call to you, then schedule a time to talk to a priest.  They usually have classes and such for people who want to become Catholic.  If it does not quite seem to click, then \"shop around,\" and attend other churches.  "
"But the fallen angels actively rejected God's authority, and were cast out. The Calvinist definition of Election states that the reprobate don't even get a first chance. They don't get any chance at all. "
"We don't know who is elect or not from an evangelism perspective so that's why we preach the gospel indiscriminately.  \n\n&gt;We all are fallen, what separates the elect from the non-elect?\n\nOnly the sovereign choice of God to set His saving love on us.  Someone who has not been chosen by God will not believe."
"There's a ton of \"secular\" music with Christian themes. Those are the songs I generally gravitate to."
"I would argue there is no *scientific* way.  Miracles and relationships with supernatural beings are not scientific by definition."
"I would definitely talk to a priest if you are interested in Catholicism. I would ask them the same questions you have here, and they should recommend resources and parts of the Bible to start out with. That's what I did at least.\n\nI really get the feeling of wanting to fit in. But in the end, you should become a Christian because you actually believe it. When I first looked into Catholicism (and Orthodoxy with it), I really wanted that historic identity, too, but that shouldn't be the driving reason to join the Church. It can, however, be a catalyst for you to learn the theology and see if you can actually believe it or not. \n\nSo yeah, I'd find a priest. And if you decide it is right for you after some time, I would consider joining RCIA. If you don't find Catholicism to your liking but still yearn for answers about Christianity, look at other denominations and their beliefs.\n\nI wish you the best!"
"I'm not upset and I'm not constructing straw men.  I just paraphrased what you said.  You said that election isn't true because of *your concept* of God without citing any Scripture.  So if you don't provide Scripture I have to assume that you're just going off your opinions."
"Since it's not a reply to your message, it's probably not directed towards you."

"[Here's a list of all the scandals that televangelists have been involved in.] (http://letmetellyouthis.wordpress.com/tag/list-of-christian-evangelist-scandals/)\n\nThere is a pattern here, and I don't think it's just the Evangelical community. I think it's the church as a whole.\n\nI feel bad for Mr. Haggard's past trauma and his misunderstanding among fellow believers, but I don't think he is special. Also sometimes these scandals are a result of outside sabotage. Not always, but sometimes.\n\nThis is why I don't watch televangelists anyway. If I want to hear some real preaching, I'll look to David Wilkerson, Carter Conlon, Paul Washer, Leonard Ravenhill, AW Tozer, or Francis Chan. Those are men of God and you can find them on youtube."
"Well, the mod didn't reply to you, did he?  :-P"
"&gt;So why would God do this to me?\n\nWhy are you blaming God?  When God created you in His image, he gave you reason and free will.  You can only blame yourself. "
"I can buy that!"
"Oh, I think you're right.  It can almost be as condescending as \"friend\""
"It would cause us to question the *inspiration* of the book as a whole, but not the theological or historical accuracy of the book as a whole."
"When I hear \"sexual sin\" the biggest thing that comes to mind is adultery and fornication, way way way more common. But I don't leave out homosexuality, not as big a problem as the others, because so many less people involved in it. That's why it's mentioned so scarcely in the bible. Not a real common sin compared to other sins."
"Forgive me for the tangent here, but this happens to be an area of academic interest for me.\n\nGnosticism contains aspects of what both of you mentioned, but the defining characteristic of the Gnostic sects was a belief in \"gnosis\" as a way through which to experience/achieve less of the material world and more of the metaphysical world. The vast majority of Gnostic sects that I know of had some variation on a belief in a lower god (the demiurge) and a G-d that did not create the physical world.\n\nAs for the word \"gnosis\" (γνῶσις), its meaning is something like \"seeking to know\" or \"inquiry\" and the word itself has no particular connotation as to the type of knowledge or experience in question. You are correct that there is an aspect of experiential knowledge inherent in the term, but our current view of \"gnosis\" has much to do with how the term was interpreted by the Neo-Platonists and various mystery cults rather than anything inherent in the meaning of the word itself. "
"no, but i am sorta speaking anti Christianity type material, i just dont want to seem disrespectful."
"Infinite regress. Can you wrap your head around that? It's pretty basic. God may have started the process of evolution but that's not the same as \"designing\" humans with all of our poorly designed processes. Wouldn't you need some evidence for the design claim ? "
"And what did you choose to do?"
"respectable answer,  and i respect your personal experience"
"Amen."
"&gt; Sin deserves death.\n\nOnly according to the second half of the bible.\n\n&gt;If not ours, then it must be a death effective to cleanse us of all sin. Christ's substitutionary death satisfies God's justice.\n\nBut it doesn't. It only satisfies the justice for select individuals. "
"I'm saying that Jesus was not drawing on an exact historical event with that parable."
"Took my first sip of iced coffee today in two or three months. Instant bliss. There is nothing in this world better except marriage, and frankly they're neck and neck.\n\nCoffee is God's love in a cup."

"Ah, ok then."
"Considering that one of the other arguments used by proponents of this mandate is that EVERYONE uses contraception, including 90% of Catholic women (no matter how flawed the study is that gave that number), despite it never being covered like this by ANY insurwnce plan, here is obviously no overwhelming need to force someone else to pay for it. It certainly wouldn't necessitate paying 3 or 4 times what others do. \n\nNo one is saying \"you can't be allowed to buy birth control\". You are free to believe what you want and to act on it. All we, and the Sisters, are asking is the same respect. Can you actually tolerate belief systems different from your own?  Or are you dedicated to using the power of the state to attempt to destroy all belief systems thst aren't identical to your own?"
"&gt; I can do 6 chapters in a day, though I really don't know what I expect to get out of it.\n\nSo, go slower and go for more than a year."
"I can feel his anger.  It makes him strong...gives him focus."
"I think means \"mute\", but I'm not him. That's what I get out of the context around it.\n"
"So why is God inconsistent?"

"I would say the only correct answer to what caused the big bang is \"I don't know\", and while it is helpful to hypothesize what caused it, it is entirely unwise to base your entire belief system off of a guess."
"Right, God desires all men to be saved.  But all men are not saved.  Meaning either there is another force more powerful than God which prevents him from saving all men, or God simply desires something more then the saving of all souls.  Obviously it must be the latter of these two options.  Calvinists simply say God desires to see himself supremely glorified more than his desire to save all men, while the Arminian position is that God desires to preserve free will more."
"I'm not going to lie, as I was thinking about this conversation, that same scene was running though my head.  "
"Correct, we are born into sin as a result of Adam's fall.  But I don't see your point."
"I'm pretty sure if that's your basis for classifying someone a person then abortion should be legal until about 19 months.\n\nThe truth is abortion destroys a unique human life.  You're destroying the potential for that life to happen.  There's a difference between a skin cell, a sperm or egg, and a fertilized egg whose cells are splitting, essentially starting up a new human being."
"&gt;I told him to keep an open mind and seek truth, and he said that he would.\n\nNow what if he dropped that line on you? "
"Sin separates us from God, pushes Him away, makes hearing Him harder. And with all due respect, your post shows a significant amount of pride."
"Relax. A lot of people (christian or not) believe things happen for a reason. So does this. It is not about blaming yourself or God. Live your life the best you can and try to be open-minded. I believe God will call you back.\nAs to why: I don't know. But Jesus loves you. That's kind of the point. No matter what you do (even converting christians to atheists), Jesus loves you."
"Angels were not created in the image of God, and he does not love them to the degree he loves us.  It's like comparing us to animals.  It's not inconsistency.  That just goes to show us how serious God is about his love for us, that he would chose to save some of us. "
"I am sorry you are hurting.  That fact is far more important to me than what you believe.  My hope for you in this new year that you find a community that loves and accepts you the way you are.  \n\n&gt;if I thought billions of people were at risk of eternal torture \n\nI don't think that the Bible teaches this.  See [r/ChristianUniversalism/](http://www.reddit.com/r/ChristianUniversalism/) for more on why not, or ask me about it."
"&gt; My reading through the bible multiple times for years wasn't enough?\n\nApparently not, nor should it be.  If you thought that just reading the Bible would give you everything you need, then you were sadly misinformed. Although Scripture is a good place to begin, I would describe it as a necessary, but not sufficient basis, on which to base your beliefs (as a Christian). \n\n"
"&gt;God is a God of mercy and love, but he is also a God of wrath and justice.\n\nDoesn't this sort of fly in the face of [2 Corinthians 5:19]? \n\n"

"&gt;Angels were not created in the image of God\n\nIs speculation. But...\n\n...why is God inconsistent with humans? Why does one human get elected and another lot if God loves them equally?"
"I was not aware Justice's could individually make decisions. "
"Well, in another post people are talking about election and predestination. Some Christians might say that God predestined you to damnation, and you just aren't lucky enough to be elected. "

"We can do good things because of the common grace of God.  Total depravity doesn't mean that we're all as bad we can possibly be all the time.  Instead it means that every aspect of our being is tainted by sin.  If we were all as bad as we possibly could be we'd each be Sandy Hook shooters and child predators.  \n\nTotal depravity means that all that we do is tainted by sin.  It describes the extent of our depravity, not the magnitude."
"Gluttony is not '50lbs overweight' it is when food becomes the center of everything to you, replaces God, I'd say you'd be much more overweight before I consider you a glutton, sometimes women gain 50lbs through a pregnancy then take it off later. I'm not saying that it's okay to be 50lbs overweight, just that it's not sin. But I still agree all sin should be presented at the same level of wrong. As it is all at the same level.\n\n&gt; I really just want both sides to understand that the issue is extremely complex and personal in nature.\n\nThat's true we always complicated things, God is simple."
"Look at the context of that verse.  Paul is writing about those who are a \"new creation\" (v. 17).  God is not counting the trespasses of believers against themselves, not all people."
"Oh cool, what is it about? Later then. "
"I would subscribe to a Christus Victor view of atonement but instead of rehashing the PSA debate let's just say there are clearly different views that are biblically based here.\n\nThe key disagreement I would then say is on *why* we die. We both agree the wages of sin is death but where you would say that it is a judgement upon us for sinning by God I would say death is merely a fact of seperation of God who is the only source of eternal life. We die not due to a punishment or judgement on high, we die because we reject life which we can see is simple cause and effect. \n\nSalvation to me is then a co operation between man and God to come into union. God's love and mercy are perserved as he offers himself to all who seek him, his judgement is preserved in rightfully determining whose faith is genuine and whose intentions are pure. The wrath of God is the indifference of God, there is no greater statement God can make against something than making it completely apart from him, separation is the greatest punishment he can possibily offer.\n"
"I would agree!"

"well I would argue that God loves the elect more than he loves everyone else.  Look at Israel in the Old Testament.  God clearly favored Israel over Egypt and the the rest of the ancient world.  "
"&gt; besides the obvious like who worshipped what\n\nThat's a pretty big difference as far as religious systems go."
"Why so much hate???? God is love."
"Why not?  What is God?  If I say \"God is the source of all things, and the source of all life\", then I can say that matter is your God, because you believe that somehow matter sprung into being of its own will and caused life.\n\nThis doesn't have to be so hard.  You and I could coexist and even enjoy each other's company, and enjoy exploring the mysteries of life together.  But when we enter into dialogue with the assertion that one of us is ridiculous, it doesn't start things out well."
"If it helps. Predestination and election are far from universal doctrines. My denomination, the Orthodox Church, regards predestination as heretical."
"Jude 7 use \"aionion\", but Jude 6 uses \"aiodios\". I would argue that Jude 7 is everlasting or never ending, whereas Jude 6 the demons are chained until the judgement.\n\nThere is no place in scripture that \"aionion\" is used that makes it difficult to translate as you claim."
"The Apostles?"
"So people \"of faith\", who presumably believe in God, Jesus resurrection etc. like I believe in gravity, they are stagnant automatons?"
"Since I'm a UU, I'd be the first to tell you that if you found peace in Islam, then that's totally OK.  But I guess I'm confused about what you expect from God that you are not getting?  "
"Is there a difference between a convert and a disciple of Christ?"
"God bless, thank  you so much!!!"
"Yes.\n\nSituation 1: nothing happens to nothing nowhere never creating all that is was and will be\n\nSituation 2: omnipotent transcendent eternal deity creates everything"
"&gt; reconciling **the world** to himself.\n\n"
"Paul was sinless? News to me!"
"&gt; well I would argue that God loves the elect more than he loves everyone else.\n\nBut why? If God elected them before they were born, why are they loved more? What did you do that makes God love you more than me? And if you didn't do it, why were you elected and not me?\n\n&gt; Look at Israel in the Old Testament. God clearly favored Israel over Egypt and the the rest of the ancient world. \n\nI would argue that is not true for a few reasons. Israel is the result of the covenant God made with Abraham, so they were not loved more, but simply had a different position. And in the context of the Egyptians, they enslaved the Jews, and the plagues was not playing favorites but one of protection and justice."
