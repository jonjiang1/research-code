"Here are the rules of thumb:\n\n* High ABV cellars well.\n\n* Darker beers tend to celler better than lighter beers (this one is iffy, based on personal preference).\n\n* Hop forward beers should not be cellared (IPA, IIPA, etc. this is because hop flavor fades with time [ask Russian River about this]. This will also apply to other kinds of flavors [peppers, some spices]). \n\n* Sour or wild beers will change with time, depending on your tastes this will be good or bad. Personally I like both kinds of beers but I'm put off by intense earthiness or acidity, which can result from extended aging. \n\nExamples of good styles to cellar: Imperial Stout, Barley Wine, Strong Ale (Belgian or English), Belgian Trippel/Dubbel/Quad.\n\nA great cellar will keep beer 55 - 40 degrees F. This allows the beer to develop new flavors but prevents the bad flavor changes that higher temperatures can bring. I wouldn't cellar a beer if I couldn't keep the temp below 70 degrees F but that's probably being safe. "

"I enjoy almost every type of beer. My roommate and other friends are all home-brewers and are way into trying different micro brews. Our favorite bar has an awesome selection of different beers all the time. But my go-to beer is Coors Light. I don't know why, but it is. I get a lot of shit for it too from people who don't know me. \n\nI've had many people standing next to me at a bar sneer and voice their opinion when I order one. It's really annoying, it's like \"First of all, who asked you? Secondly, I don't need to justify my preference for certain beers to you. Lastly, your opinion about it doesn't matter to me regarding this.\"\n\nYou may hate Coors Light et al macro brews but lots of people genuinely enjoy them, get over it.

I'm actually surprised the company does well at all because the owner is a total ass. He truly believes that his customers need him more than he needs them and has no problem not selling to someone if they make him mad for whatever reason. I really believe the only reason he stays in business is because he's the main DFH/Stone/Ommegang distributor for my area. I think if he lost one of those brands he'd be gone shortly after."

It doesn't mean they are greedy. It might just mean they care about the future of their brand and their employees.\n\nI don't understand how their trademark was under threat.  Will Firestone Walker send a letter to Union Jack Brewing in Sault Ste. Marie and threaten legal action through NAFTA?  \n\nI could understand if a brewery produced a beer called Firestone Walker, or tried to name themselves some variant of Firestone Walker, or purposefully aped some portion of their logo.  Unfortunately, in all the cases of which I am aware the similarity proposed was superficial at best.  \n\nUltimately it comes down to an attempt to trademark the language.  Duplicate titles occur in art, fiction, and music all the time.  It means little, and would be unenforceable for someone to bring complaint against someone for using the same title for a song.  Thus in the discussion of craft beer, is it a work of art, or a commercial product, and what is the difference between the two? \n\nMy conclusion is copyright and trademark law create an abusive market situation, and small breweries who have already invested in their label and suffer the curse of attention will have to fight the orders.  It'll suck when the legal costs kill the small brewery in favor of a handful of litigious giants.  \n\nI also don't think F-W really wants me as a beer drinker anymore anyway.  They want drinkers who can't tell the difference between Firestone Walker and a brewery in Ohio to never suffer shelf confusion.  It's not a loss to me.  That's one decision I'll never have to make in the beer aisle again.\n"

And I probably will forever because it's only 16 ounces of beer and it can never be THAT bad.\n\nMacro brews are awesome things to drink lots of in the right time &amp; place, just like listening to really shitty, senseless pop music is just right at the certain time &amp; place.  \n\nIf you like music, you need to know enough about music to know what you like and, more importantly, to express why you dislike something.  Approach beer in the same way, if you can't express WHY you like OR dislike something, you may not have the command you think you do.\n"
"Yea but, I mean, Upleft is right.  If you are camping with your boys in the summer, or even spring, you want a nice, light refreshing beer, probably an American macro-brew that you can drink quite a few of and enjoy the day with a slight, beautiful buzz and then go to bed early, wake up relatively 'late' and feel like you just had one of the best rests of your life.\n\nI don't want to drink some boutique Stout, I want to drink 20 Coors Lights in 8 hours and go to bed.  Time &amp; place man, it isn't hard."

My favorite beer isn't the best beer I've ever had, it's not the most expensive beer I've ever had, it's not the most unique, and it isn't the most memorable.  My favorite is the beer that I will never get tired of drinking and always goes well no matter the company or occasion.  I have a favorite, it's been the same for years, yet I've continuously tried new things (I make it a point to always drink something I've never had before when I go to WOB or the Saucer) and found new things I greatly enjoy. \n\nI think it's totally possible to remain open-minded while also having a favorite beer that doesn't change as the wind blows."

Drank about half of the Red Stout before dumping the batch, and moving  onto the Karbach. \n\nHonestly can not imagine a worse brew than that Guinness. It was terrible. Would rather drink Keystone."

"I think keeping it in your fridge was key to this process. "
"While it does take me a while to empty a keg, I've never attributed any change in flavor to any small drip after pouring a pint.  I generally chalk it up to the natural change in flavor of unfiltered ale, since all of what ends up on my taps are homebrew.  \n\nSince I try not to drink too much during the week, it takes my girlfriend and I about that long, ~3 months or more, to work through a 5 gallon corny keg.  Maybe a bit less since I generally bring a gallon or so to co-workers.\n\nGenerally speaking, commercial kegs last a really long time.  I know a guy who's had the same keg on his tap since early summer and it's still in good shape.  Maybe if it were some sort of IPA or DIPA it might have a shorter shelf life, but he got a less volatile ale.\n\nI'd be really hesitant to pin stale or oxidized beer flavors on a leaky tap, and more lean towards a bad connection at the gas in on the keg.  Unless it was only the first pint after letting things sit for a day or 3.  If beer in the line is oxidizing while beer in the keg is fine, then maybe you are leaking air back into the lines from the tap."

"Something that doesn't exist can't pop. Really, there's no such thing as a craft beer bubble, not even saturation of a market. The industry will not keep on growing at the pace it's growing now, and at some point the annual number of new openings or projects will slow down too. \n\nFurther, 'craft beer' it's not a uniform thing. Among the companies that categorise themselves as 'Craft Breweries' there are several business models. A brewpub isn't the same as a large (I should macro, but that would create unnecessary controversy) brewery that makes over a million barrels a year, which in turn isn't the same as a Gypsy Brewing operation, which in turn isn't the same as a small brewery with only very limited distribution."
"As a cellar master and owner I will confirm this. Also a brewer program doesn't hurt if you have the time or money. That being said if you have a smallish brewery around your location it would be best to try and get an entry level job there. If they can't/won't hire you then there is an opportunity to volunteer. I spent a couple summers cleaning floors, hauling grain, emptying garbage, bottling and that sort of thing. It helped realize that the job holds little romance but I still wanted to do it. Experience is better than anything else. I have a degree in Philosophy so education isn't necessarily a requirement but it helps."

Some ales improve, lagers don't seem to, but nothing, diluted or undiluted, tastes as good to me is a Ranger with a dash of water in it. \n\nI've been drinking it this way for over a year not out of ignorance as to what a good beer should taste like, but because I've struck on a particular concentration of a particular hop profile that makes my insides sing. I'd be stupid to disregard that simply because it's a non-standard drink. Challenge your beliefs! "

While I honestly couldn't give a rats ass what you drink, you must understand that no one is going to agree with you.

I know how much different beers cost per the quality. There are a couple other IPAs I like. I'd pay $30 for a four pack of Surly Wet and you'd better believe I'd drink that straight. I recently had a [Victory Hop Wallop](http://www.victorybeer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/H_Wallop.png) and I wish I could have a dozen more of them. I know what a pale ale is and I've had a couple that I enjoy. I drink them and then I still end up coming back to the watered Ranger. The price can't be beat, and nothing else makes me feel quite so good without making me feel drunk.\n\nI don't want to know how you feel about the _idea_ of it, I know y'all have a huge mental block on the idea that beer can be used as a mixer, what I want is someone to put a bit of it in their mouth and tell me what it tastes like to them, and tell me how it makes them feel.\n\nEdit: oops, surly comes in four packs"

Storm Brewing is taken (albeit in Canada) - not sure if the \"*'s*\" will make it different enough.  \n\nWith that said, I think you should consider talking to lots of bartenders in the area that you want to set up shop. Find out the most common brands/styles that are bought. Talking to local customers and finding out about the local beer culture online may help, too! If you can go on your local subreddit, BeerAdvocate, RateBeer, etc. and survey the local pop that'd be super helpful.  \n\nEdit: So apparently the Left Hook isn't an actually brewery as far as I know, so what I said previously is wrong (AFAIK)."
"Tbh, there's quite a limited supply of small breweries in Finland imo. The legislation of selling alcohol is pretty strictly controlled so it's quite a hassle to set up a brewery in the first place. So I'm not surprised about the limited audience for Finnish beers in the States.\n\nAlso, ment to add to my earlier comment, but I prefer the Imperial Stout by Laitila over the one by Plevna. Both are good however."
"Wait...they/you are asking for 'support.' Which essentially reads to me as \"fund our vacation/trip.\"  Which they are then trying to capitalize on through movie and book?"
"Bad news first.  Liquor, Wine, and Beer have to be purchased at State-run liquor stores.  Generally, you are never more than 10 minute drive from one.  Prices are high and no case discounts even on beer.  Yes, you pay for beers individually.  Now for the good news.  While SLC's out of state beer selection is not that great, there is a high quality of local beers at your fingertips.  I'm just giving you my personal preference.\n\nAlways in my cart when I go to the liquor store.\n\nUinta Brewery - Dubhe - Imperial Black IPA - ~7% I think.  \nLaguintas Brewery - Lil Sumpin' Ale - Pale Ale - ~6%\nUnitas Brewery - Cockeyed Cooper - Bourbon Barrel Barleywine - ~10% (Only comes in 750ml for 12 bucks)\n\nThese are my go-to bottled bar beers \n\nRed Rock Brewery - Elephino - Double IPA - 7% - I love the name\nWasatch Brewery - Devastator -Double Bock - ~8% \n\nMy go-to draft beer is Uintas Brewery Cutthroat Ale - Best 4% beer \n\nHope this gives you a little direction.  I still have a formidably haze from last night. Now I'm off to find my car.  Wish me luck."
"I was thinking more support = page views and/or help if you know any people in those breweries"
"[Maybe the NEAT Glass](http://shop.theneatglass.com)"
"How does one both afford this and be able to take off work for an entire year, all while being old enough to drink?"
"That makes more sense - although they are asking for donations.\n\nI would put them in touch, but they aren't stopping in my city.  Which is fine, our brewery is 'okay' at best."
"PayPal donations"
"You ask for donations online. "
"Yeah, I'm actually a lot further along on the nuts and bolts of the process but there are a few things we want to figure out in terms of our general direction."
"Yep, I'm concerned about the Storm brewing, but there are permutations on about any name that isn't totally weird, so it's trying to find a balance between used and something that is accessible to the general market."
"&gt;Side Note: Left Hook Brewing seems to be taken, according to the quick google search I did. \n\nDon't think so. Looks to be a home brewer that put his stuff into Untappd. But definitely research Ratebeer and the trademark office before picking a name!\n\n"
"Oh, thanks for pointing out left hook, somehow I missed that one... shit."
"Do you happen to be from Tualatin or the general area? I recognize the names you chose from landmarks around there."
"http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/33472/\n\nAccording to BA and resellers, it's a tripel."
"Try it if you want, but when I tried both Torpedo and the Pale ale watered I was disappointed. Just drink that one as is. Thank you for thinking about it though!\n\nMost beers do not improve with water. Only a select few do, and Ranger is the best"
"&gt; Fifty cases of 24 bottles each and 10 kegs were in the van, the police report says. The cases were estimated to be worth $15,000 total, and the kegs $3,000. **That works out to $300 per case and $300 per keg.**\n\nI'd like to know what he was hauling."
"Yep, we would like a locally themed name, but as has been pointed out, many of the local names are weird and difficult to pronounce."
"2013: Sam Adams Light (I was drinking Ithaca Cold Front but I ran out and this was all that I had left)\n  \n2014: Evil Twin Brewing Lil B"
"Think brandy, scotch or wisky highball for Utopias.  Its less a beer and more a fine cognac/brandy.   Ive had good results with a sherry/port glass also.  "
"Maybe something like Willamette Beer Works or something like that?"
"Oh is that what it is? Well I didn't notice that. I just assumed it was a small/local brewery, didn't think of it as being possibly homebrew. Thanks for checking!  :D"
"Is there a list of the breweries they're visiting?"
"Can't agree with this enough. So good."
"someone had an awesome new year. death penalty?"
"You're gonna have a bad time"
"Because it makes you sound like a pretentious dick...you're not better than something because of your choice of beverage. "
"insurance scam by  the company"
"Interesting version of a tripel for sure!"
"Last of 2013 was a Lost Abbey Gift of the Magi. \n\nFirst of 2014 has yet to be determined, but it's probably going to be a Stone IPA. "
"Or r/beercirclejerk more specifically"
"lol death penalty. just hang the guy by his nuts"
"Are they trading off who drives each day so that there is a sober (or at least sober-ish) driver, or are they about to get a bunch of DUIs?"
"If he plans on making it to Schell's Brewery in New Ulm, MN, I'd be more than glad to get him a nice local beer."
"[deleted]"
"You can probably write it off on taxes like Guy from diners drive ins and dives"
"I think they are going to pick up odd jobs in the breweries along the way to help with some of the money"
"It already exists, unfortunately. Not Beer works but brewery and brewing."
"Hey everybody, I'm thinking of quitting my job to drink beer all day for an entire year. Give me money, please."
"Victory Dirt Wolf. \n\nRunner up: Victory Hop Ranch. "
"Tualatin Valley? "
