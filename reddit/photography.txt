"The first is too far out. It could be people running for a sale for all you can tell about what's going on."
"It looks like they're just out of focus. If they're sufficiently far away (they should be), you should just be able to focus at infinity and be good.\n\nThat said, as far as settings go, I shoot at ISO 100, ~f/11, and bulb. I keep a remote in my hand so I can control when the exposure starts/stops, which as a result controls how many fireworks I get in one shot, as well as how long the trails are."

"The 50/1.8 is indeed built cheap and plasticy, but if you look after it, will last for years. "
"The 50/1.8 is a fine lens. Is it cheap? Yeah. Is it good? Yeah. You can't go wrong with a 50/1.8. It's the most mass produced FL ever in ever. The 50/1.4 is also plastic, and in my experience, the AF always feels like it is going to break, and tends to break quite often. \n\nMaybe get the Sigma 50/1.4, which is known to be better."

"82mm isn't so weird.  The 24 TS uses it, the 16-35 uses it, the 24-70 uses it.  Tamron's 24-70VC uses it...  Canon was smart and made big filters a more normal thing to us, so everyone is jumping on the bandwagon.  I predict that the 400/5.6L IS will take a 82mm filter if it takes front filters, as will the 300/4L II.  The 17-40L IS / 17-40L II will probably take 82mm filters, too.  82mm is a nice size, since it prevents vignetting for pretty much as wide as the lens designer wants to go at even decently fast apertures.  77mm is the old standard, but before that 72 was the standard.  \n\nWe're going to keep going up until we get to 100mm or so, at which point lenses which utilize bigger filters fully would be mind bendingly expensive ultrafast wides, like a 21/1.4.  "
"I'm not subscribed to the guy, or anything, plus, I already have a D7000, so I wouldn't be interested in a d7100..."
"My 1.8 broke after less than a year. Canon repaired it under warranty. I traded it to a guy for an iPod.\n\nI'd pick the 1.4 over the 1.8. Or, actually, these days I reach for my Voigtlander Ultron 40mm f/2.0."
"Get the 1.8 and take care of it.  You can sell it and get the 1.4 should you decide you want to upgrade down the line.  I did a lot of concert photography with a 50mm 1.8 and I loved it.  Depending on your style you may decide instead of a 50mm you instead want an 85mm or 35mm prime.  Eventually I did get the 50mm 1.4 but it's not an insignificant price difference."
"Thanks for clearing that up. I thought 77mm was the current standard, it seems that I stand corrected. Maybe it's just because I'm always surrounded by 70-200s."
"If Nikon were to create a camera with the following features:\n\n* Small screen\n* Bare bones software (no effects etc.)\n* Basic metering (spot or average)\n* Manual, Aperture Priority, or Shutter Priority only. Physical controls.\n* Small metal chassis (as small as a FM/FE)\n* Full frame sensor  \n* ** No autofocus (swapable focusing screens)**\n* US$1500\n\nWould it be popular? I would want one, but would it sell?"
"I lasted about two weeks with the 50/1.8; it felt fragile and sure enough the focus mechanism broke after very light usage.  Canon churn out 1000s of these lenses though, so might have just had a bad example, but even when it was working it wasn't very nice to use... too close for indoor portraits on a crop sensor and the autofocus was pretty hit and miss as soon as the light dropped.  Shame because the picture quality was awesome for the cost of the lens... if you manage to get the focus right the images were pin sharp.\n\nI ended up swapping it for the 35mm/f2 which I've found a much nicer lens to use... was about £200 which is more than the f1.8 but I think it was worth the extra.\n\nThe other popular option is the 40mm pancake... goes to f2.8 and costs just over £100 at the moment.  By all accounts a very good lens indeed, especially as a first prime."
"Hi, I cant find your channel.\n\nCan you put a link here to a video you made about ML?\n\nTnx!"
"The 70-200L IS II takes 77mm filters, as does the 24L II.  The 135L, 85L II, 50L, and 35L all take 72mm filters, which seems to be the \"big+fast prime standard\" size.  Canon is phasing out of 77 into 82mm as of right now.  For wide-angles it prevents vignetting, for telephoto it allows bigger front elements, which allows better correction of aberrations and reduction of vignetting.  Nikon is in a state of limbo, as they have nothing to use 82mm filters.  The 70-200 takes ye old standard 77, the 24-70 predates canon's introduction of the 82mm thread size, the 14-24 is too fat to take filters, the 17-35 is too slow to need 82mm threads, the 24/1.4 takes 77s, the 35/1.4 takes 67s, the 85/1.4 takes 77s, the 135DC I think takes 72s...  I expect the 24-70G II to take 82s though, if the F mount could even utilize a system benefitting from a larger front end.  I'm not sure it can because of the throat size, but it could be computed.  A lens can obviously be made with a bigger front end, I just don't know if the performance would be greater, worse, or too comparable to be a financially \"valid\" improvement.  \n\nThen again, they released the 58/1.4G at a ludicrous price with terribly mediocre performance, and marketed it to be mostly coma-free when it has as much as the 50/1.4G...  I still think nikon fired all their intelligent engineers due to budget cuts and hired new fools.  They can't seem to do anything right lately. "
"This rule of thirds is a good place to start for a beginner but there are dozens of elements with each frame that can lead you to make a better composition if you just take the time to look. Sometimes just moving an eighth of an inch will make everything relate perfectly within the frame.  Sometimes the balance can be horribly thrown off by one single element. you'll notice, for instance, that anything sitting in the lower right corner will have a disproportionate amount of visual weight for which you may need to compensate. Look for things that create diagonal movement...note that there's comfort in resting a figure against the edge of a photo to ground it and make the vertical work double time. A visual design class can be very meaningful to a photographer.  "
"I had the 50/1.8 and it was a fine lens, though the autofocus motor would push the element a bit too far and it'd have to adjust back, the 1.4 is quicker and quieter autofocus. The plastic on the 1.8 was never a problem, it just made the lens lighter. That being said, neither look good wide open, 2.8 or smaller, ideally closer to f/4. Unless your subject is quickly closing distance, I don't think you need the quicker autofocus, and if you're stopping it down to preserve image quality, you certainly don't require a 1.4 either."

"I'll pile on here - I used the 50mm f/1.8 for years and loved it, finally decided to grab a 50mm f/1.4 because the USM focus was supposed to be much better. I have to admit that I don't feel a bit difference, both are nearly useless autofocusing in low light and in decent light I never had a problem. The f/1.4 feels like it's built better, is bigger, etc., but that's not very compelling to me. If I had to do it again I'd probably not bother to buy the f/1.4 and put the money towards a different lens.\n\n(shot the f/1.8 on a T2i and 5D, shot the f/1.4 on a 5D and 5D3 - the 1.8 is so cheap I never sold it, so it sits in a drawer as a backup in case something goes from with the f/1.4)"

Or maybe not."
"The build quality of the Sigma is IMO better than the Canon version."
"Meh, it's part of sigma's old line of poorlyish made things.  The finish is terrible and prone to deterioration and it's still plasticky.  Better, yes, but not $150+ better when canon will fix the 50/1.4 under warranty for free anyway. "

"Heh, the telephotos I plan to buy in march (70-200 f4 IS, 70-300L) both take 67mm filters.  MSRP $1700... still a fairly poor person tele.  \n\nNikon's 70-200 f/4 is actually pretty good, one of the few things they have done right lately.  The AF is a new mid-tier motor that I don't really understand why they produced, but optically it's pretty good.  No better than canon's (IS effectiveness aside), which is a shame given the age gap.  Still a good lens.  \n\nBesides, the 70D is a whole new sensor!  \n\nI expect the announcement to be a D4x using the D800 sensor.  Anything much higher wouldn't make sense, since it would have to break 45 or 50MP to be appreciably higher resolution, which is, frankly, too much for *anything* in nikon's lens lineup to handle.  \n\nMaybe it will have a new AF module?  Probably not, seeing as it's a \"studio\" body, so rolling out new AF in it makes no sense.  It could be the second thing in the world to ever use XQD cards or whatever the stupid sony storage in the D4 is.  \n\nI think the backlight on all the buttons was the only thing genuinely new and useful the D4 did.  *Everything else* the 1DX does better, which is a shame.

"&gt; Heh, the telephotos I plan to buy in march (70-200 f4 IS, 70-300L) both take 67mm filters.\n\nYou're getting *both*?\n\n&gt; Nikon's 70-200 f/4 is actually pretty good, one of the few things they have done right lately.\n\nThe VR power is insane for the price (4 stops IIRC). I think the f/2.8 VR II is equal, or maybe worse, but it's a $2400 lens. Still, at $1400, I'd rather have a 70-200 f/2.8 VR I, but maybe I'm biased. I'm a sucker for f/2.8, and I wouldn't get a too much use out of VR just because I shoot sports. Any time I'm shooting slower than 1/400 with a telephoto is a rare occasion (other than flash at 1/200, but then again there's no motion blur). Plus, it comes with a tripod collar.\n\n&gt; Besides, the 70D is a whole new sensor!\n\nA whole 1/3 stop improvement in ISO! Still, the dual-pixel AF is pretty cool.\n\n&gt; I expect the announcement to be a D4x using the D800 sensor.\n\nI think we discussed this before, but I'll reiterate just in case. With Nikon saying they're trying to limit their lineup, I'd say that it's a *possibility* that they'll merge the flagship and flagship x lines like Canon did with the 1D and 1Ds lines. But I dunno. A D800 sensor in a D4 body would've been my *definite* guess if Nikon wasn't trying to cut down on their lineup.\n\n&gt; Maybe it will have a new AF module?\n\nEye-control AF please :D\n\n&gt; It could be the second thing in the world to ever use XQD cards or whatever the stupid sony storage in the D4 is.\n\nDoes anything else use XQD anyway? Either way, AFAIK it's pretty damn fast. I don't really feel comfortable handling CF cards anyway. I always feel like I'm gonna break the pins.\n\n&gt; I think the backlight on all the buttons was the only thing genuinely new and useful the D4 did. Everything else the 1DX does better, which is a shame.\n\nI got to test out the 1D X at B&amp;H as well as the 5Diii. They both cemented my opinion against Canon ergonomics :/ It's personal preference but I don't like the feel of Canon.\n\nThey're both extremely capable cameras anyway. I think we're at the point where D4 or even D3s tech won't ever be obsolete, seeing as you can shoot ISO 6400 or even ISO 12800 extremely cleanly, the AF is ridiculous, and the build quality is insane. I wonder what else could be added that would be revolutionary, rather than an improvement. The D3s's high-ISO performance was revolutionary, for example.\n\nSure, the 1D X has an edge, but I don't think it's enough that it completely eclipses other reasons to get a D4 over a 1D X (Nikon lens collection, ergonomics preference, etc.). That's speaking from an amateur's perspective, though. If you're paying for a D4/1D X, you probably want the absolute best you can get.\n\nEdit: Now that I think about it, a touchpad kinda thing where your thumb or middle finger is to select active AF points would be lovely. Having to use a D-pad to select AF points is really clunky, especially when you have 51."

"A 70-200 f/2.8 and lots of space. If I didn't shoot sports, I'd take the Sigma 18-35 f/1.8."
"I normally don't just dump stuff on people and say \"pick for me, it's too much,\" but this series was very abstract and conceptual, which is far and away different from [the type of stuff](http://www.flickr.com/photos/scythels/9439016645/) that I [normally do](http://www.flickr.com/photos/scythels/9611129364/) so my sense of what's \"good\" is all scrambly.  "
"Is there a cheaper alternative? "
"I always recommend the 40mm pancake over the nifty fifty for a budget prime, for these reasons:\n\nf/1.8 is only 1 1/3 stops faster than f/2.8, and the 50 has a much narrower DoF if shooting wide open, as well as lens aberrations that make you want to step down to f/2.5 or smaller anyways.  You have to nail the focus if you want to use it at 1.8\n\nthe pancake can be shot wide open all the time.  the only aberration is vignetting (as far as i can tell).  it also has a closer MFD (AFAIK)\n\nthe 50 1.8 has cheaper build quality, harsh pentagonal bokeh, and poor autofocus in low light (though you could use the AF assist beam on your speedlite if you turn the flash off from the menus).  The AF is loud, buzzy, and not that accurate (IMHO), and if you want to switch to manual you have to hit the switch then navigate this tiny manual focus ring.\n\nthe Canon 50mm 1.4 has fragile build quality (the focus helicoid will be bent if you drop it on its side), but very good image quality.  in fact most people consider it comparable to the f/1.2 L at f/2.8 and smaller\n\nYMMV with the Sigma version.  I had it for a while (now have the 85mm 1.4 Sigma) and i liked my copy of it.  I loved the bokeh, colors, and IQ.  AF performance was decent, but not like most of the complaints i commonly see.  Mine was a later model version.\n\nthere are plenty of vintage prime 50mm lenses out there that only require an adapter if you don't mind using manual aperture and focus, but that is an acquired taste.  but if you are one of those people that do 50/50 video and stills, it's a great way to build a budget lens lineup."
"All fast 50s offer great image quality when stopped down a bit, so that's not where you'll see a significant difference. *Everything else* about the 1.4 is far, far superior to the plastic toy that is the 1.8—I'm sorry to disagree with most people ITT.\n\nThe construction is far superior; the AF is faster and near silent (USM); the focus ring is so, so much better, *and* you get \"full-time manual focus\"—i.e. you don't need to switch the button to \"MF\" to be able to focus manually—*and* you get a focus distance scale; the bokeh is much smoother (though not as smooth as the 1.2's); and it's even marginally better optically at the wider apertures. Also, the 58mm filter thread is a more common size than 52mm, that you might share with other lenses.\n\nSure, it's more expensive than the 1.8, but it's still a *very inexpensive* lens, as lens prices go. If you plan on using the lens frequently, the choice seems obvious to me."
"I can see my Sigma 17-50 f/2.8 being my sole lens for quite a while. I was using the 50 f/1.8 and really liked the IQ but often found myself wanting a wider lens, not to mention it was noisy, had poor AF performance and poorly built. \n\nThe Sigma fixed all those issues."
"&gt; You're getting both?\n\nOne or the other!  The one stop on the ~200 range doesn't matter to me, it all comes down to how close they are in price when the time comes.  I'll rarely shoot them faster than f/8, but I've used \"450\" on APS-C plenty of times, so I feel like I would really miss the 300mm mark with the 70-200.  It's noticeably lighter, cheaper, a bit brighter, and thinner though.\n\nThe new f/4 70-200 has \"VRIII\" without being called that.  The marketing is 5 stops, so it's really 4 in stable hands and a solid 3 in unstable ones.  \n\n&gt; A whole 1/3 stop improvement in ISO! Still, the dual-pixel AF is pretty cool.\n\nSadly, canon's sensor development is currently capped by their process size unless they design a new architecture.  \n\n&gt; I don't really feel comfortable handling CF cards anyway. I always feel like I'm gonna break the pins.\n\nI'm a bitch and love SD, but pins really aren't that breakable, especially with how short they are on CF cards.  Of course it's possible, but I took my 1100T out of its socket and put it in a new board freaking *twice* without bending any of the hundreds of pins on it.  I've taken the microcomputers off the [breadboard for my senior project](http://i.imgur.com/38dO2WX.jpg) three times too.  The pins are starting to get a little iffy, but stills socket fine.  They're much bigger and the connection is stronger than CF card pins though.  \n\n&gt; I wonder what else could be added that would be revolutionary\n\nArray-less phase detect?  It would be possible to construct a stupid cost, for-the-brick-bodies-only chip that had an overlapping mesh of sensors.  You could use a joystick, or an eye sensor to select any area within the frame to focus on.  The individual sensors could use beam splitting capable of picking up at f/2 or f/1.4 and sensitive enough to go down to eg: EV -4...  That would revolutionize AF.  An ISOless sensor could be produced that operated at 20 or 24 bits per channel on a really clean sensor design...  A quadra-processor triple-battery 4GB-memory camera could be produced that could drive the mirror at 24fps and do 5k capture in that mode.  That would revolutionize sports *and* cinema.  \n\nI don't think the absolute best differentiates the D4/1DX, rather lens collection.  A pro who has a 24-70, 70-200, great white or nikon big gun, 24/1.4, 35/1.4, 14-24/16-35... etc, probably won't switch brands for a 10% better body.  "

"Either DxO's was a bad one, or the 18-35 breaks my understanding of optics.  It deteriorates after f/4, an aperture at which it shouldn't be diffraction limited.  Either its center is a little worse than the area just around the center, or the diaphragm is poorly placed, or something.  It's a distagon, so the center region of the design is telecentric and the iris can be placed at the front or the rear.  Normally the iris goes at the rear of the area of telecentricity, but I don't get how the iris could be placed such that the telecentric area hits diffraction at f/4.  \n\nThe only thing I can really think of would be it being a lens 1 1/3 stops slower than it really is and covering FF with the rear smushing the circle down to cover APS-C only, but the rearmost group projects pretty much straight back.  \n\nSigma, what the hell did you do."
"It is still a useful camera. There are some features you might be lacking relative to a more modern camera (like live view, video ability, and higher ISO latitude) but you can certainly learn a lot on that one.\n\nOne thing to check, perhaps, is if the battery or batteries included with it are more recent than the camera. Factory original batteries (from when that was made) are going to be of pretty heavily reduced capacity.\n\nFortunately, aftermarket batteries are cheap to order - knockoff NB2-LH's will only run you $15 apiece from amazon. Just be prepared to get a new battery if the ones with the camera weren't recently replaced, say in the last three years or so.\n\nYou might, however, plan on replacing the lens with pretty much anything else - even the kit lens from the newer rebel t2i/t3i/t4i/t5i if you find someone that is upgrading from theirs. The original EF-S 18-55 lens that came with that camera is pretty terrible, and you'll see a huge improvement if you can simply snag a 18-55 IS or something similar.\n\nBest of luck!"
"&gt; One or the other! The one stop on the ~200 range doesn't matter to me, it all comes down to how close they are in price when the time comes. I'll rarely shoot them faster than f/8, but I've used \"450\" on APS-C plenty of times, so I feel like I would really miss the 300mm mark with the 70-200. It's noticeably lighter, cheaper, a bit brighter, and thinner though.\n\nI've had a *professional* paintball/portrait/wedding photographer tell me that he knows that his 70-200 f/4 has superior optics and AF than the 70-300 IS he borrowed, but he would take the 70-300 just because it's longer. On top of that, he's using a 7D, so it's *really* long. It was the last thing I expected to hear.\n\n&gt; The new f/4 70-200 has \"VRIII\" without being called that. The marketing is 5 stops, so it's really 4 in stable hands and a solid 3 in unstable ones.\n\nIt might be a photography/paintball thing but I feel like I'm the only person I know IRL that can handhold and break the 1/focal length rule. My U2 setting (aka my \"friend/family wants to use the camera\" settings) has auto-ISO with auto shutter speed set to 1/focal length (which is the default).\n\n&gt; I'm a bitch and love SD, but pins really aren't that breakable, especially with how short they are on CF cards.\n\nOh I know they're hard to break. It just feels like I'm gonna break them anyway. I feel the same way whenever I try to plug in my motherboard headers and they're not eye-level, so I have to lay down on my stomach or something.\n\n&gt; I took my 1100T out of its socket\n\nI feel CPU pins are short and stubby enough for it to feel sturdy. They practically put themselves in anyway.\n\n&gt; rray-less phase detect? It would be possible to construct a stupid cost, for-the-brick-bodies-only chip that had an overlapping mesh of sensors. You could use a joystick, or an eye sensor to select any area within the frame to focus on. The individual sensors could use beam splitting capable of picking up at f/2 or f/1.4 and sensitive enough to go down to eg: EV -4... That would revolutionize AF. An ISOless sensor could be produced that operated at 20 or 24 bits per channel on a really clean sensor design... A quadra-processor triple-battery 4GB-memory camera could be produced that could drive the mirror at 24fps and do 5k capture in that mode. That would revolutionize sports and cinema.\n\nI change my statement to \"that would be revolutionary and not cause a significant price or size increase.\" Active cooling in conventional DSLRs would be pretty cool (heh) and would allow processing power to increase and noise to decrease (not sure to what extent, though).\n\n&gt; I don't think the absolute best differentiates the D4/1DX, rather lens collection. A pro who has a 24-70, 70-200, great white or nikon big gun, 24/1.4, 35/1.4, 14-24/16-35... etc, probably won't switch brands for a 10% better body.\n\nI think it's too late for dramatic brand jumping to be made anyway, unless Nikon does something absolutely revolutionary. Canon has had the upper hand for a while now."

"I had a 550D for about 4 years and the EF-S 17-55mm 2.8 on it 95% of the time. An awesome all-around lens with great low-light capability. Was quite sad to let it go for a full frame :/"

"Actually, the even nicer thing about the mac approach is that it's the fundamental system libraries that do it, not Preview or any other particular app. Preview itself is almost nonexistent, it's just a tiny wrapper around the pervasive platform frameworks.\n\nThis means that _every_ application gets this for free. You want your text editor, your terminal, your stickies, your calendar to be able to read RAW files? They all already do.\n\nIt also improves system security by having exactly one media handler library for everything. So when an exploit is discovered and the library is patched, everything is effectively updated immediately. You don't need to wait for the author of every application you use to separately implement their own (different, possibly still vulnerable) patches.\n"

"I did some similar research a few months back and the Vagabond lithium is the best option, providing it is compatible with your lights. \nIn my case it won't work for more than one Elinchrom head so I went with the Innovatronix (http://www.innovatronix.com/index.php/webshop/portable-battery-packs/tronix-explorer-mini-115v-60hz-detail). It's more expensive and considerably heavier (sealed lead-acid batteries) but does the job.\nTL:DR - nothing cheaper, Vagabond lithium is the best choice. "
"Try marsh media in alexandria. I got a large 1.6m x 0.6m photo printed and mounted recently, it looked great was pretty cheap and the guys there were nice and were helpful\n"

"I understood some of those words!\n\nI'd totally buy one just to test out its optical magic, if it weren't for my  sneaking suspicion that there are very few copies out there that have reliable AF."
"I believe it uses the embedded JPEGs in raw files to view them at 1:1 *extremely* quickly (maybe it's just magic, not 100% sure). If you're working with 20MP+ photos (regardless of how powerful your computer is) or have a weak computer, it's much faster than LR. For certain photographers (wire service shooters, wedding shooters), and it has powerful keywording and tagging features ([code replacements](http://www.sportsshooter.com/news/1951) for pro sports photographers, especially wire service photographers, are a big one).\n\nI don't use any of the more advanced keywording/tagging features myself, but I can cull through through thousands of photos (2k photos in one day is not a rare occurrence) several times faster than in Lightroom, which can save me an hour or two."
"&gt; That probably wasn't the L 70-300. It's as good as the 70-200/4, it's just wider and goes longer and has an extending barrel and all that jazz.\n\nOh no.

If they die off, I'm not sure who's going to take their place to compete with Canon, and IMO Pentax is too small to win."

"There are more reasons for shooting RAW + JPEG than simply viewing the images."
"I would think most of them should be the same, sigma is trying to be a high-end mfg so their products should be consistent.  The fairly \"full\" depth of field, coupled with it being a zoom, could make the DoF pretty iffy, but it *should* be good... most of the time.  \n\nAdmittedly, I haven't looked tons into it though."
"\"Ooh, that will look cool,\" is plenty good enough. If you're talking about staging a photograph, look for repitition (such a row of similar things, or things that are the same shape/color, etc.), look for off-center symmetry (or just balancing one side with the other; balancing there with \"not there\" can even work) look for colors that resonate with each other. Look for a diagonal or \"C\" or \"S\" curve...  Squint your eyes and try to look through your viewfinder seeing things as splotches of color or light and dark if you do black and white. If you were just ripping out pieces of black white and gray paper and piecing it together, as though none of the blobs represented actual objects, how would they look good? How can you place them where they would just relate well to one another.? \n\nAs an art student, I spent every class composing images. I'm talking thousands of hours of working on 2D surfaces. One thing that really helped me in my first drawing class was taking a piece of cardboard and cutting a hole in it the dimensions of my paper. For a photograph, this would most likely be something with a 3x4 ratio, so it could be 3/4 of an inch by one inch.  Cut the square out with a razor knife and just practice looking at things through that and thinking about them as abstract bits of color and form.  Just looking around your room you will be able to see how things relate to the edges and to each other within the frame. \n\nWhat happens when you cut off the back of a person in profile? What happens when you cut the top of their head off and the eyes are on top of the image? (Yes you're allowed to do this!)\n\nWhat happens when you get in really close? What are the design elements of just a face (color, lines, movement, gradation, patterns, etc.)\n\nWhat happens when you tilt the window and everything is on a slant? \n\nWhat happens when you let a red ball or a bright pink toy rest at the bottom right edge? \n\nWhat happens to the feeling of the image if you move the window just a little. Is it off kilter? Try to see why it feels off kilter to you. Think about balance. edit: punctuation, sp\n\nSo many photographers don't see these things and their work suffers badly for it. It's sad that the world of photography is too often divorced from the world of fine art. They have, potentially, so much in common. Unfortunately, the type of people who are drawn to the technology often don't bother to develop a good feel for the art itself. \n"
"Unfortunately, this happens everywhere, by amateurs and professionals alike. I have seen many people try and spook animals, just to get that action shot, or even just to get them to turn around.\n\nEspecially with amateurs, people often don't realise that wildlife can be very dangerous. I've seen people in an open-topped vehicle drive within two metres of a pair of lions. Luckily, the our lions are completely used to cars, so they just shot them a dirty look and wandered off. But try that in less tourist-y areas, and the lions would have been enjoying a nice meal.\n\nAlso, a PSA that doesn't get mentioned often: try not to use flash around animals. It's not just because it's disruptive to them, and that it pisses off other people. If you're around certain animals (namely African Elephant) it can piss them off to the point of killing you to get it to stop."

"Format your memory card after you've copied anything off of it.  The firmware has a bug that makes the start-up time slower each time it is read by a computer.

I've considered upgrading to a f1.4 but with the images I've been getting, I'm thinking that money could go towards something else.\n\nI'm thinking either a 35mm or 85mm prime for myself. If you are going to be shooting live music, maybe the 85mm f1.8 may be an option for you? If you shoot crop, you'll get a fair bit of reach if you can't get close on an 85 and its not too expensive. Maybe a bit more than the 50 f1.4."
"I keep telling myself that for how good it is, it's worth the price even just to be used as a manual 18mm f1.8 prime. The milky way panoramas I could take with that thing would be baller."

Well, I've never been there, but I've seen some pictures/media/movies about the place.  I'm a diver, so the reef and ocean life is particularly appealing to me.  I also like the unique varieties of animals that aren't found anywhere else in the world, not least among them the kangaroo and koala.  I find your aboriginal culture and symbolism to be fascinating, and somewhat mystical.  And then there's the rough, untamed beauty of the deep outback that I find particularly attractive - but mainly as an idea.  I'm pretty sure that even though I'm fairly competent in our bush here in Canada, I'd probably be dead inside a couple of hours out there in your bush without a knowledgeable guide.\n\nIt's funny.  Seems like maybe we're both suffering from the 'grass is greener on the other side of the fence' syndrome.  Maybe it's a good time to stop where we are and look around a bit closer.

I have the ever basic 600D, taking into account that sometimes my mates want to shoot video :P So yes, the crop would bring it up to 85mm already, and 90% of the time I'm right at the front of the stage anyways. Judging by the consensus of what's been written in this thread so far, I might just end up getting the 1.8."

"I'm one of these people (well, not anymore, but I was until a couple weeks ago).\n\nNot all photography is done for artistic purposes. I was doing photography for a research project. I took identification pictures of the animals. Thousands and thousands of them. I shot with JPEG+RAW so I didn't have to process said thousands of shots, or even bother pulling them into Lightroom and exporting them, but if there was a shot I liked I could process it too. It also meant that if I wanted to take a picture of something else while I was out in the field I didn't have to remember to switch to RAW and then switch back afterwards."

"Well, canon's compacts division is doing well, powershit N aside. "
"That's true. Then again, as cliche as it is to question a company's development decisions, Nikon hasn't been doing well for a while. They definitely got the D7100 right though. The D800 and Df are questionable. They aren't the most needed cameras (dammit, release a D400 and D700s-whatever already), although there is demand for them (however small)."
"I think your feature list is a bit bare-bones. It has some restrictions that simply don't need to be there.\n\n* Small screen. Why? Besides making the body of the camera smaller, this has no benefits.\n* Basic metering. Why not put in evaluative metering of some sort? It's not going to inflate the price much.\n* Manual, Aperture Priority, or Shutter Priority only. What do they gain from leaving out Program? If all the control dials on the camera had an \"A\" option, like Kai mentioned, all four options would be available.\n* No autofocus. I think this would alienate too many users to make sense. With autofocus, it would be a retro-throwback marketable to the masses, but without, it's a niche item. I know many people here are happy with manual focus (especially with swappable focussing screens - that was a dumb move), but the majority of people like autofocus at times.\n\nI think Nikon could still accomplish its goal (or what the people want) with these features. I think removing things for the sake of removing them is a waste. They removed video for the sake of removing video. There was no technical reason to do it. No one is going to not buy the Df because it has video."
"I'm not too sure what lenses you already have but the f1.8 produced great images when I was shooting with the 600D. It was one of my first EF lenses that I bought and it was way sharper and more useful than the kit lenses. I think you'll be happy with it."

"I actually think the D800 was one thing they did right.  Mid-size body, rugged, best in class sensor for landscape.  It's the \"landscape/studio\" camera in a small body, and for that it's pretty perfect.  \n\nThe D7100, D800, 70-200/4, and D4 were the only products nikon got right recently, I think.  \n\nThe 28/1.8 has too much field curvature to be a good \"cheapish sort of in nikon terms\" wide prime that is usable for landscapes, but fails to provide the same level of character as the 28/2 ZF for like 2/3 the price.  The 58/1.4 feels like and probably was a lens they spent a bunch of money trying to develop and then pushed to sales anyway after it wasn't that good and they were in the hole on it.  It's possible that it's made to compete with the 50/1.2L, but the 50/1.2L is better than it for much less money, so...\n\n"

"&gt; I actually think the D800 was one thing they did right. Mid-size body, rugged, best in class sensor for landscape. It's the \"landscape/studio\" camera in a small body, and for that it's pretty perfect.\n\nWell, yeah, it's perfect, but I still don't think it was the right decision. It is the perfect camera for its application, but unlike the 5Diii, it's not very well-balanced. If you shoot in a studio, then it's the perfect camera, but sports shooters are kinda left out. I would prefer if Nikon put out an extremely well-balanced camera for any application such as the 5Diii rather than an absolutely mind blowing niche sensor, but I may be biased.\n\nThe D4 was done right, but compared to the 1D X there wasn't much innovation, not like there was room for any. IMO it's an extremely well-balanced camera, except for the price tag.\n\nThe holes in Nikon's lens selection are things I can live with IMO. Canon is the same way. The 50 f/1.8 and f/1.4 have their...\"design flaws\" and there is no cheap 35mm prime, but they have f/1.2 primes and some really nice telephoto offerings such as the 135mm f/2. Nikon doesn't have a cheap L-equivalent telephoto (seriously, if there was a $600 70-200 f/4 in Nikon's lineup I would jump at it) but they do have a 50mm f/1.8 and f/1.4 that aren't made of plastic and don't randomly spit out their focus motors.\n\nMeh, it's not something two people on a subreddit can change."

My list is barebones because that seems to be the direction people (myself included) expected from the Df and of the \"Pure Photography\" concept. I know there are people out there who wish for simply a classic film SLR with a full frame sensor. Nikon had a chance to provide this, but really missed the mark with the Df, in my opinion."
"I had the f1.8 and it was great.  It was quite good wide open, though it was sharper stopped down a bit.  However, because of the crop factor, I ended up supplementing it with a 35mm f2.0 that I used more often.  Considering the cost, that'd be the way I would go - the 50 1.8 for portraits and the 35 2.0 for walkaround."
"i dont think its necessary to go THAT much into detail about why you should get paid for your services.\n\nyou can simply tell them your rate, and if they dont feel that is a fair value for your talents and services, that they should find a photographer that DOES fit their budget.\n\ni find that once you bring up the word \"value\" and \"fair,\" they look at things more from your point of view, rather than just their own."
"Meh, the 50/1.8 isn't much worse than nikon's, other than the build.  The 50/1.4... meh.  Canon will fix it in like 4 days round trip for free, so it's meh.  \n\nThe 50/1.8G is made of plastic and is really quite plasticy, the focusing ring is terrible compared to my 35/2IS too.  \n\nLikewise, the 35/2 is $500 which is... sort of kinda cheap for lenses.  The 35/2 non-IS sells for about $250 as well.  It's old and focuses loudly, but it works decently.  The 35/2IS has fantastic bokeh where the non-IS is pretty meh/abrasive, but it's far newer and sexier.  \n\nExcuse the webcam, but [this](http://i.imgur.com/HSQAfIx.jpg) is the 35/2IS on my 6D next to the 50/1.8G on my D5100.  It's pretty [palm sized](http://i.imgur.com/fcRhpmV.jpg) and looks [pretty sexy](http://i.imgur.com/IbQVQ94.jpg) on the 6D, if I do say so myself.  Not that that matters at all.\n"
"I don't see how shooting with both harms anybody in such a way that requires a post imploring people to stop. \n\nI shoot in both and will continue to do so, namely for the fact that I go through and pick out the raw files I want to edit and trash the rest. I'll keep the jpgs around just as a backups that takes up 1/4 of the space, just in case I wanted to look at them. "
"Thank you for replying. I'm leaning towards Scancafe. They say they use Nikon 9000s but I was hoping to find a review from some one who actually used them."
"Thank you for that link, it saved me probably a lot of frustration in trying to do things myself. Ctein certainly knows what he's talking about."
"Everything doesn't need to be mass marketable. The flagship cameras are not mass market. Neither are medium format cameras, tilt-shift lenses, superteles, astrophotography bodies, the list goes on.\n\nI'd say a \"digital back\" SLR is a viable niche now, if the explosion of MF adapters was anything to go by. Whether anyone has the nerve to go after it is another matter, and no board or committee at Nikon or Canon would know how."
"So m4/3 is a standard mount?"
"&gt; Meh, the 50/1.8 isn't much worse than nikon's, other than the build.\n\nThat's what I was referring to. At least the 50 f/1.8G has *some* metal in it.\n\n&gt; Canon will fix it in like 4 days round trip for free, so it's meh.\n\nThe one time I have to send something in to Nikon is the time I'll regret shooting Nikon. Completely forgot how superior Canon's service is, especially with CPS.\n\nThe 35 f/1.8G is only $200, but it's a DX lens, so I guess it balances out. At least it's an option. The 35 f/1.8G for FX is coming out soon, so that'll close that gap.\n\nI forgot that the 35mm f/2 IS was one of Canon's few sexy lenses. Apart from the L lenses, I don't find many Canon lenses to be visually appealing. That 35mm is an exception."
"Oh, they definitely missed the mark. The screen size and the autofocus I do understand, from a size perspective. However, if they left autofocus out, I think a larger screen would be almost necessary. Since it would have to have a nice OVF, a good focus peaking implementation would help open the camera up to the masses. Some people might object to it because it isn't \"pure\", but including it wouldn't harm anyone, and would be a huge plus to many."
"RAW files do not have a DPI, just the pixels themselves.  When you convert to a JPG for example you can specify DPI at that point.  That said DPI only matters when going to print, when you view the image digitally you are only seeing the actual pixel count.\n\nImage quality is a completely different beast altogether and has nothing to do with pixel count (after a certain point).  There are many high quality images from older cameras that have a much lower pixel count than modern cameras.\n\nEDIT: I should add that if a camera doesn't support RAW and only JPG the DPI can still be adjusted for printing later on and is not set by the camera.  "
"Thank you for replying! I could not find what kind of scanner they use from their website, but their E6 processing prices are very competitive."
"I said this when it came out that the focus screen was fixed, and people in this sub jumped on me for it.\n\nThis is a camera that vaguely looks the part and crumples under pressure. The concern now would be if it fails commercially in addition to critically, does that turn Nikon off \"retro\" forever? Or would they go back and \"full-ass\" it as Kai put it?"
"Is it that guy? \n\nUgh. It's that guy."
"Unwatchable."

"Yeah but Panasonic was recently in bad shape and started a joint partnership to reduce its involvement in sensors.

"I think categories would be a good idea. But the trouble is getting a small list that covers as much as possible. How would the categories be set up? Would there be a separate vote for each category? Would it be a single vote like last time, and picking the winners with the most votes from each category?\n\nThe processing question is a tough one. Personally, I would say that a HDR is not too far - given the community's general view on HDR, anything that's been overdone and is unrealistic probably wouldn't make it too far anyway. I don't see a tastefully done HDR as too much manipulation - photography is all about working around the limitations of your equipment, which after all is what HDR is all about. Multiple exposures though, for instance a milky way blended with a landscape, should not be allowed *if they weren't taken form the same spot at the same time*.\n\nLove the idea of a photobook :D\n\nEDIT: When will submission open?\n\nEDITEDIT: Will you be limited to a single entry, or will you be allowed to submit multiple shots?"
"Were you at Ocean Shores? That place is ridiculous in terms of the amount of photographers running around.  I had the same thing happen to me last year where another photographer spooked the bird. I got lucky and got a [cool shot](http://www.flickr.com/photos/penname/8402240858/in/set-72157638641254944/lightbox/), but I felt bad that it had to fly away just because someone didn't care enough to respect its space."
"I think the community's attitude towards HDR has changed over the year. Perhaps in 2012 a lot of people were just discovering HDR, and so we were getting a lot of \"clown vomit\" ones, whereas now (more) people know how to control themselves and use it with a light touch?"
"I'll take one question type bit to the modmail since it wouldn't be nice to voice it publicly, but just a question.\n\nWhat about images that have been on flickr/etc for a long time but haven't been posted in this thread?  Are we considering \"virgin to the subreddit at large's eyes\" a criterion, or is \"banning\" from this thread just a protective thing?\n\nIt's hard to imagine that the red umbrella in the rain that won last year was a whole year ago.  Shit I'm getting old."
"If they'd done manual/shutter or manual/aperture priority using real dials like the cameras it mimics, I would have been interested. (i.e, turn aperture to A for shutter priority, or turn shutter to A for aperture priority.)\n\nEven if it were manual only without matrix metering, that would be fine. Give me a DOF and distance scale and a split prism and I'm really interested.\n\nI don't have a Nikon DSLR because they aren't what I want. It seems like they want to sell a different kind of camera, but one that has all the features current Nikon users expect as well. But current Nikon features are already available in current Nikon cameras, so why would anyone care?"
"Alright, fine. Give me ten minutes with ~~Photoshop~~ a launching pad and gunpowder. If I'm not done, read this again."
"You should learn how to use \"back focus\". There is a button on most DSLRs where your right thumb rests. This can be set to focus so you use the camera's smarts to get the focus right, but you can let go of the focus button and it will stay put through multiple shots until you want to re-frame and refocus, then you press the focus button again. ...I used to do a lot of dance photos, I could never have done it in normal half-press autofocus, things change too fast to wait on refocusing. Because it is technically still in autofocus mode and hte motor is still engaged you can't accidentally knock it out of focus. "
"Well, as far as I understand, there are many factors that affect image quality and megapixels is one of them.\n\nYou are right in the sense that in certain print resolutions you will not see the all the pixels of the original image. Although you may find a higher megapixel sensor could resolve finer detail in a picture and that may be evident in print.\n\nYou could say in that case that it would improve the image quality."
"Most m43 lenses are from PanaLympus + a couple of third parties. \n\nThe nice thing about the m43 system is the short flange distance though, which practically means you can adapt most other existing lenses to the m43 mount - MF only of course, but with the focus aids on modern cameras that's not big of an issue anymore."
"I want to be honest here - PanaLympus already had some fire sales with some older models in the past (similar to the Nikon 1) and if they continue to do so because they desperately need the sales I'm gonna snatch up a cheap PEN or so, just to play with some old lenses. :D"
"Exactly. I've seen some HDR from the community in the past year that I never would have guessed was HDR if they hadn't said so.\n\nIs it really fair to penalize someone on a crop camera, or an old camera, for trying to recreate the dynamic range of a modern full-frame? Or a full-frame user trying to recreate the DR of medium format? It's a tricky question."
"Now I start to like your thinking."
"Focus peaking is a workaround for crappy focussing screens on cameras made for autofocus. Put in a split prism/microprism array and a 1x viewfinder and you won't need it. Remove all the crap around the focussing screen and you can have a decent viewfinder again.\n\nYou know, do the things the camera they were copying had. :)"
"&gt; That's what I was referring to. At least the 50 f/1.8G has some metal in it.\n\nEh, the 50/1.8 also costs twice as much.  The 55-250 STM is going to get my recommendation *all over* APS-C tele questions because it performs as well as the 70-200/4IS out to 200mm, f/4 aside.  It has a plastic mount though.  At $350 it's a stupid good deal though.  \n\nI hate plastic mounts (the 18-55 is harder to mount because of it, and if you're not perfectly aligned it's easy to half-shear off a bayonette).\n\nThe new canon aesthetic is quite pretty.  All-black or a very white white.  The [55-250](http://media.the-digital-picture.com/Images/Other/Canon-EF-S-55-250mm-f-4-5.6-IS-STM-Lens/Canon-EF-S-55-250mm-IS-STM-Lens-on-Camera.jpg) doesn't look half bad, nor does the [15-85](http://media.the-digital-picture.com/Images/Other/Canon-EF-S-15-85mm-f-3.5-5.6-IS-USM-Lens/Canon-EF-S-15-85mm-f-3.5-5.6-IS-USM-Lens-on-7D-Top.jpg).  I quite like the new aesthetic, really.  The 15-85 even has the focal lengths written on an angled thing to make them easier to read.  Win-win-win.  \n\nOne thing I don't like is the unlabled \"macro with a yellow line\" areas on focusing scales, or even worse like the 24-70/4L where it has the macro position on the focal length barrel... cringe.  \n\nThe 70-300L is a [chubby one](http://media.the-digital-picture.com/Images/Other/Canon-EF-70-300mm-f-4-5.6-IS-L-USM-Lens/On-Canon-EOS-60D.jpg), but canon's coatings look [pretty](http://media.the-digital-picture.com/Images/Other/Canon-EF-70-300mm-f-4-5.6-IS-L-USM-Lens/Front-View.jpg) on the front :3"
"Also, unrelated question: since the photos will (hopefully) be used in a photobook, will there be a minimum limit on resolution?\n\nEDIT: How about stitched panoramas?"
"There are people out there who find focus peaking faster and more accurate than traditional viewfinders. That's why I'm saying to add them both. You want to use one, use it. Don't like the other? It's not hurting you."
"FWIW, a friend of mine shoots his slides with a 5DMII, so maybe it's not so hard."
"Those aren't mass-marketable, but they're also very expensive as a result. Do you remember when the Df was announced? People were *slamming* it for costing as much as it did. People were mad when it wasn't cheaper than any other full-frame on the market. If the Df cost $3000 or $4000 because it's a niche product, people will hate Nikon even more."
"Quality is a really weird question. How do you measure it?\n\nTraditional output for screen is 72dpi, output for print is a different question. "
"Thanks for adding to the discussion. This doesn't need to be said every time a DigiRev video is posted."
"Which 50mm?  The macro or the f/1.4?"
"Image quality is subjective and has very little to do with mega pixel count. Like Tenchiro said, DPI only matters when going to print. A larger pixel count gives you a larger image which can be printed larger without losing quality. \n\nWhat effects Image quality is the skill of the person taking the photo, the lens, the sensor, the lighting, the subject matter, the story and the post processing. "
"I've seen people do this with elephant, rhino, and even lions. And this is in a place where even opening your car door is forbidden. Admittedly it was almost never professional photographers, but simply tourists trying to get a better shot."
"Something like this happened a few years here in Chicago (Montrose Harbor) that ended up with the flushed fowl getting killed by another, much larger raptor.  \n\nThis really screwed up the level of trust in the local birding community, and it became a thing where only really trusted people were told where things were. \n\nAt this point, if I saw someone doing this, I would bludgeon them with my tripod. That shit is just not ok. "
"It at least starts at f/2 and the f number doesn't change when mounted on a smaller sensor, however the field of view does change.  Your LX5 has a 5.1mm to 19.2mm f/2 to f/3.3 zoom.  However because the sensor is smaller than a D3200, 5.1mm shows a similar field of view similar to an 18mm to 60mm zoom lens used on a D3200.  \n\nAperture affects two things, image brightness and depth of field.  In terms of image brightness the f number is the same.  An f/2 lens on either camera will have nearly the same shutter speed for the same scene, if the ISO is at the same level (there may be slight differences in how much internal reflections reduce the light).  \n\nHowever depth of field depends on aperture diameter and an 5.1mm lens at f/2 (2.6mm diameter) is considerably smaller than a 35mm lens at f/2 (17.5mm diameter), so the d3200 will have much narrower depth of field.  "
"Canon/Sigma 18-35mm f/-3 or whatever largest aperture you can find for that range.\n\n~17-40mm is your walk-around range, large aperture is your fast guarantee... Then start reading reviews on whats our there with a critical eye."
"I think part of the reason people were upset about the Df's pricing is because it was around that time that the premise started failing to pan out. It became apparent that it was indeed no different than any other full-frame on the market."
"This ~12 minute video response makes the hour you spend listening to Gary interviewing Chris time well spent: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Zi7g7uEn7c"

"I've seen a guy do it with, of all things, a hyena. Etosha NP. The hyena had crawled into a divit next to the road, tourist in a hatchback city car got out to walk over and try to photograph it from outside. The hyena dashed at him but pulled up short. The guy ran to his car and drove (illegally) fast out of sight, as if driving 5km would make up for having been 5 metres from an animal that doesn't bother to suffocate you, just rips you open and watches you watch him eat you. "
"10-22mm, because I like shooting wide."
"I prefer a focal length of around 45mm FF equivalent, so something like a 28mm or 30mm fast prime would be excellent. It'd be small and light so that I wouldn't mind shooting it all day. A large zoom is heavy to carry around for more than 3 or 4 hours, but if it's just for a couple of hours, I suppose I wouldn't mind a 17-50 (or 17-55) f2.8."
"I was seeing pricing expectations from the initial spec list, which gave no clue that it wasn't going to be what people wanted.\n\nBut even when it became clear it was \"just another full-frame\", some people's price expectations were unrealistic. The D4 sensor, the best low-light sensor available at the moment, for less than a D600? That was *never* going to happen.\n\nDo you think enough people would buy a $3000~$4000 retro Nikon to make it financially worthwhile? All of the things you listed, minus perhaps astro bodies, have real markets, and are things that some people need, and those markets aren't going away. A retro body isn't something anyone *needs*, so the market would likely be much smaller."
"Sometimes someone wants a picture _now_.\n\nIt doesn't bother me, since I'm never doing professional photography work."
"He bought a new 35 recently and seems to find it a bit more challenging than 50 to work with, but I think he likes it more...maybe."
"Sorry, I got distracted.\n\n[Sponsored by your friendly neighborhood TSA](http://imgur.com/CJRnEca)."
"Why not just export the batch you want to share?"
"What makes you think that? I think these are going to be files supported for a long time."
"How did you get that extra viewing step integrated into your workflow? wouldn't it be easier to just let it import, make your selections and then cull the bad shots?"
"Hah, mine are from Etosha too! I'm betting the this was within a couple kilometres of Nebrownii, or over near Salvadora/Rhino Drive? I never saw anyone actually get out of their car near the culverts, but I've seen people lean out of open doors.\n\nHyenas are possibly more worrying than lions. They're much more skittish around the cars, so they're much more likely to make a bold move like that. And I'd *much* rather get taken by a lion. Having seen what they can both do, the lions are much kinder about it.\n\nThen there are the tourists (and guides, which is worse) that just don't respect the wildlife. I've seen tourists cut mother giraffe off from literally day-old babies. My god that pissed me off to no end. It's not uncommon that the park staff have to put down giraffe because they've broken legs after being scared by cars. It probably didn't help that I was working on the giraffe, and at the time trying to photograph them, but I was pissed off for the rest of the day."
"This makes me realize how much I take for granted beautiful wildlife shots.  I hope I haven't been upvoting/praising pictures that were created by disturbing the animal....."

"I had high expectations for this camera. It's a shame that it does not seem to be what I imagined it would be. "
"Probably not the answer you were looking for but, build it, couldn't be that hard"
"Yeah.. Most of the flaws seem like they can be worked around, dealt with, and compensated for, nothing is a total dealbreaker. But, vintage style with no allowances for MF at all? I would kill to hear the reasoning the design group gave for leaving that out, especially as it seems like they provided mount support for all of those lenses."
"I measure it by how easy it is to work with in photoshop. When i was trying to put together a catalog for a fishing lure company, the (very cheap) boss gives me this camera from walmart. Claims they spent a bunch a money on it (i knew it was a lie.. totally basic point and shoot run of the mill pocket camera).\n\nThe objects were shiny and curved. I had a light tent setup and everything. Now, after taking some shots, i noticed that cutting out the background was terribly difficult. When you zoom in with photoshop, you could see all kinds of artifacts, bleeding from the background into the object, etc. etc.. However, if i sent the product off to their standard photographer, i would get the images back sharp and crisp. Cropping out backgrounds was a SNAP. Zooming in you could see SO much more detail, crisper lines, defined curvatures. If you set the two photo's side by side, any moron could tell the difference.\n\nI always attributed this to the guy having a SLR, working in with RAW files, and exporting to whatever format and size i wanted. The standard P&amp;S camera i had, only had settings for real world size of the picture (which would be the megapixel), but whenever i imported the photo's from the camera to the computer i was ALWAYS stuck with 72dpi jpeg.. there was no option to change this."
"I live in the area, check out Redstone and Hanging Lake."
"A lot of folks agreeing with you and gathering their pitchforks.  But I have a different take on this.  I think you are preaching to the choir here, and those that really need to hear it don't give a damn.\n\nI lived in the southern jungles of Central America last year, and enjoyed photographing the wildlife.  In a lucky coincidence for me, a two-toed sloth just happened to live in a tree right above my front porch.  This provided some awesome photography opportunities for me...until the new neighbors moved in.  They were typical older, middle-class Americans who cold not speak Spanish, had not traveled much, talked about their love of Wal-Mart etc.  When they saw the sloth, they immediately began hand-feeding it, taking pictures, and telling everyone in town about it.  Pretty soon tourists of all nationalities were showing up on our door every evening to touch and pet and feed this wild animal, take flash photography at night right in its face, etc.   They turned the whole damn thing into a petting zoo.  Of course, this pissed me off big time.  \n\nBut you know what?   This is what happens when we set up our equipment next to roads, buildings, and homes.  If you were taking a picture of a snowy owl and there was another woman right next to you, chances are you were in a local park or trail - not out in the forest.   I could see if you were upset if you'd spent 3 days hiking to get to a deserted location...but you probably just drove up and parked next to a bunch of other cars.  You have to have realistic expectations in that situation.  Same goes for the guy who was angry about the Bison picture on the highway with the minivan driver.  Just like me with the sloth - I was on my front porch, not out in the jungle.  \n\nIt's 2014.  Every moron and their brother has a camera, and we can't control what other people do with their cameras.  Not anymore.  But we can control where we shoot.  We can certainly respect our animal subjects, but in this day in age we cannot trust others to do the same.   I'd suggest wildlife photogs start getting back to our roots and moving further afield, raise our own standards, and remember what puts the \"wild\" in \"wildlife\"..."

"But if you take an inch, and divide it up into 72 pieces, painted each piece and put it together to make an object... wouldn't you be able to take the same inch, divide it into 300 pieces, paint each piece and make a much more detailed object?"
"YOU'RE NOT MY REAL DAD!"
"Like the D800? D7000? Even the D610 beats anything the competition has at the same price point. "
"Ah, I see. Well, its Fuji or an old polaroid. The polaroids will be more expensive, and film is fairly expensive as well. Fuji still makes a pack film for certain types of polaroids, its not the same film as is the instax cameras, FYI. There's also the impossible project trying to make new polaroid film with some success, I think you can't expect each pack of film to consistently work, though."

Another situation that had my heart in my mouth was in Hwange, watching a jeepful of tourists get out of their cars and take photos of giraffes drinking across a tiny pond, not knowing that there was a hefty, injured male hippo hiding (oddly, I know) in a barely hippo-sized bush just metres away. Those guys just wandered off again, they didn't even get the adrenaline rush! \n\nSpeaking of which, I have my own story of being ran at by lions, which while arguably not my fault certainly serves as a reminder that you need your head screwed on.

"Meh, I find the AF-Ds ugly.  The AF-Gs mostly look pretty good.  "

"Cameras don't capture anything directly to do with DPI, DPI is a display or print scale-per-resolution measurement, it doesn't exist in relation to the image until you print it. Cameras capture a fixed total number of pixels, and you scale those to a final size. So, more megapixels either increases the DPI you can print the same size image, or the size of image you can print at the same DPI.\n\nIf there is significant art if artifacting in your light tent setup, your camera is likely exposing using higher ISO sensitivity, you need to either shoot at slower shutter speeds to gather more light instead of boosting the sensitivity, or increase the amount of lighting you use, to the same effect.\n\nA DSLR will certainly have an easier time producing a good shot in less than ideal conditions, and be easier to control. To be honest, though, with adequate light most point and shoots could likely make perfectly usable brochure size product shots. Getting adequate light is a lot easier to set up and control with a DSLR built to work with studio lighting though.\n\nThis of course leaves aside considerations of the actual resolution of the lenses and such, but for a brochure sized print, we're probably working with more res than we need either way."

(5616 ÷ 72 = 78)\n\nIf I re-save it at 350ppi (without resampling) it will print at 16 inches along the long edge.\n\nFor screen resolution ie websites you need 72ppi.\n\nFor printing in books and glossy magazines you need 300-350ppi, newspapers 200-220ppi. Talk to the publishers in question to be sure.\n\nFor printing on inkjets or for making prints to frame, someone else will chime in on what ppi is required, I never do that.\n\nSo, to find out the print size of your image divide the total pixel width by the required resolution. \n\nEh, what is dpi then? \nTake a magnifying glass to your favourite magazine or book. It is the printed equivalent of a pixel. You'll find that all those fabulous colour pictures are made up of Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and Black dots."
"Pentax reporting in! I'd more than likely go with 31mm f/1.8. Because why not?"
"You should re-read my post and some of my other answers to people's responses on here. Thanks though"

"It's amazing how well the large animals can hide, isn't it? I've seen full-grown bull elephants successfully hide behind a tree that you'd think would hardly hide a human.\n\nLions can give you a hell of an adrenaline rush, that's for sure. I've had a lion turn around, roar (which is fucking *load* two metres away) and chase us at full-sprint, staring up into my open window. Admittedly, we were chasing it at about 60km/h, so I can't blame it (this was legit though, we had good reason for doing this). I never had a lion come at *me* on foot, thankfully."
"Sigma 50mm f/1.4 instead of the Canon."
"Ope. Sorry. The 1.4. Also, sorry about the confusion on the prices, that makes way more sense."
"To be fair, the 60Da isn't much work for canon.  After they produce the sensor itself all they do is put a clear/optically neutral filter on in place of the IRUV cut filter.  It's not a whole lot of work for them, the D800e is more work relative to the D800 than the 60Da is to the 60D."
"It's not hard to get a good copy if you're willing to use the Sigma AF dock."
"Great. Now I'm gunna wanna pull out my basic camera and try to recreate what i'm seeing, cause i'm totally lost.

LOL"
"I said the same thing in an earlier thread and downvoted to hell!"
"The 24-105L is amazing for full frame.\n\nOn crop, the low light performance is a bit limiting, as is the focal range."
"I'd vote the Sigma 18-35/1.8, like a lot of other people here.\n\nThat being said, there's a surprising lack of love for the Sigma 30mm f/1.4 here. Especially if used on a mount with built in image stabilization..."

"I don't see what the problem is with this. In fashion and advertising, postprocessing is almost *always* outsourced. \n\nThe idea is that photography and postprocessing are separate professions, and the best professionals only focus on one or the other. I'd say you still need to know a little bit about postprocessing to tell your post artist what you want, but you don't necessarily need to do it yourself. "
"Dat lack of aperture tho\n"
"I think the aesthetic fits more with the film bodies. Still looks better than the old Canon design in my eyes^^^MY ^^^BRAND though :P"
"Zoom: Sigma 18-35mm f/1.8 or Canon 17-50mm f/2.8\n\nPrime: Sigma 35mm f/1.4 or Canon 24mm f/1.4 or 85mm f/1.2 "
"If you do, you're adding an adjustment to an adjustment, which will never be better than as making an adjustment to the original image. You can never get back the raw image, because a) the camera's whitebalance adjustment pay push pixels out of b) the already reduced dynamic range of JPEG, combined with c) the lossy compression artifacts of JPEG."
"Yes. That's like buying a camera with more megapickles and printing at a higher DPI for the same size. \n\n"
"Just because it isn't a realistic expectation doesn't mean it isn't a valid one.\n\nI believe humans are perfectly capable of cohabiting with wildlife in wild regions, even in this modern world. Your situation is not excusable - the neighbours should never have hand-fed the sloth, and probably shouldn't have told everyone.\n\n&gt; But you know what? This is what happens when we set up our equipment next to roads, buildings, and homes.\n\nI take issue with this statement. It is shifting the blame to us. We should be able to set up our equipment, and take pictures, without other people coming in and ruining it for everyone. Not everyone can go on week-long hiking trips just to take pictures of animals, and we should have to either, just because of other people.\n\n&gt; but you probably just drove up and parked next to a bunch of other cars.\n\nWhy does this mean we should accept that people will behave badly? Sometimes other people are unavoidable. My stories all come from a large national park. There is nowhere to go to see these animals that doesn't have people.\n\n&gt; I'd suggest wildlife photogs start getting back to our roots and moving further afield, raise our own standards, and remember what puts the \"wild\" in \"wildlife\"...\n\nOnce again, not everyone can do this. It shouldn't be too much to ask that an amateur photographer can go to a local trail or park to shoot some animals without having them all scared off by other people?"
"Output for screen in a measurement involving inches? How do you know what monitor size your viewers are using? Output for screen is purely pixels. "
"I often go to a park/garden to look for some birds or deer when I'm bored. And it's the fucking kids that piss me of the most. There was a small deer no more than a couple months old grazing by some trees. and I see it and I keep my distance. I take a picture and notice that it's really underexposed from the shadows near the tree, so I adjust. As I adjust a bunch of kids come running \"Look a Deer\" and scare that deer and it runs off. \n\nAnother time In that same place. I was near a lake shooting geese and turtles and this kid no older next to me picks up rock the size of a tennis ball and throws at the nearest goose. Luckily the goose put it's head down in time but the rock hit it's back and scared all the geese, and turtles. I look at the kid with a stern face, and he smiles at me, and he just stares at me until he realizes that I'm pissed and leaves (his mom was right there too, she didn't care)\n\nTL;DR: Kids are assholes around animals, they don't know better so supervise them when they get close to them"
"How about this... If you take two identical pictures, both with a native physical print size of 8.5 x 11. One picture can be 72dpi, and the other can be 300 dpi, correct? Both exactly the same printed size, but one has more dots per inch.. this is possible, right? "
"Exactly. Amazon customer service is fantastic. Even if it were name-brand, sometimes DOA happens"
"Depends. The aperture is wide enough to let in enough light at night, but where the focal length is right depends on what you plan on shooting."
"[deleted]"
"Oh, I can quite imagine everything wrong with the picture, it just doesn't have anything to do with DPI at all, and has everything to do with small sensors, lack of light, strong noise reduction, and probably white balance issues and jpeg compression :)"
"What that idiot did was illegal. From Yellowstones website...\n\n*\" It is illegal to willfully remain near or approach wildlife, including birds, within ANY distance that disturbs or displaces the animal.\"* [SOURCE](http://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/viewanim.htm)"
"&gt; I already have a Nikon3100 with the Sigma APO DG lens, and was thinking it may not be suitable for landscape photography.\n\nWhat's the focal length? It's expressed in a range of millimeters (18-55mm for example).\n\n&gt; Anyway, what camera would be best suited for landscape photography.\n\nYours is perfectly fine.\n\n&gt; Is it true that the more expensive camera you buy, the better the overall quality of the image, or is it how a person uses the camera that makes a difference?\n\nTechnically, they're both true, but for landscapes, the gap between low-end and high-end cameras is narrower. When you're in challenging situations, higher-end cameras make a difference, but in the end it comes down to the person handling the camera. There's a point where you outgrow your camera and hit its limits, but it takes time to get there.\n\n&gt; Do I absolutely need the ND-filters, a tripod, etc. or maybe something else?\n\nYou want ND filters for long exposures. Tripods make everything easier, but they're not absolutely positively 100% essential, unless you're shooting long exposures. You might find that a circular polarizer is useful, especially if you're shooting water."
"I'd say, if they don't pay a deposit, you leave it as \"I'll be there if nobody else wants me that day\". "
"It is. "
"I bought some Lenmars for my Canon S100 (high-end pocketable camera), but they were absolute crap. Others have had OK results with Lenmar, though. "
"Ok, most of those issues have to do with a crappy low rent camera (which is why they're cheaper than a DSLR). But jpeg compression.. when you take a picture with a standard camera, doesn't it automatically put the image in a jpeg format (at least most cameras). If so, isn't the file arbitrarily stored at 72 dpi?"
"That's a great story. I was incredibly lucky in that I got to do a reasonable amount of work on foot in Etosha, by virtue of being a researcher and knowing the park staff. I was working on some of the infrastructure at a waterhole with one of the staff, so we were out of the car. I was carrying tools from the truck over to the pump, when I noticed two lions lying under a bush staring at us, about 40m away. I calmly (don't know how, I was pretty much shaking afterwards) walked over to the guy I was working with, said \"lions\" and walked back and got in the truck. We then had a merry chase through the bush to drive them off (a different chase from the one I mentioned before though), and thankfully they didn't come back while we were working.\n\nThere was also a time where we were driving about 10 kilometres, with seven of us standing in the back of the bakkie with a tranq'ed lioness at our feet. Turns out the drugs leave the eye reflexes alone, so she blinked every time we went over a bump. That was an intense few minutes."
"Yeah, the 60D isn't particularly specialized in terms of design/production cost."
"If I was in that situation, I'm not sure I would have been able to resist picking up a similar rock and throwing it at him. Shit, that makes me mad."
"If that's the case, then if I take a consumer grade camera and it arbitrarily forces an 8.5 x 11 to 72 dpi, and if i take a DSLR which will give me the option to use the raw file and port down to an 8.5 x 11 tiff at 300 dpi (or whatever format i want, at whatever higher dpi i want), then isn't it likely that the *quality* of the dslr be better, since it'll have more dots per inch, which means more data, which means finer detail?"
"If your printer can print that high and your eyes can resolve the difference? Yes, a photo with a higher dpi would contain more information. \n\nShort version:\n\nDSLR vs P&amp;S: Doesn't make a difference at all in terms of IQ. Literally ZERO. Compare Sony's RX1 P&amp;S to Nikon's DSLR D3200. \n\nHigh megapickles vs low: Doesn't make a difference generally. Old cameras are crappy because they're old. New cameras ALL have enough megapickles.  My 1D3 has 10MP and I print 12x18 for work from crops often. \n\nSmall sensor vs large sensor: Doesn't make a difference, but influences the next one...\n\nSensor density (photosites): This one matters a lot. It determines how clean your output is. My 1D3 has 10MP in an APS-H sensor. Those are some large photosites. Nikon's D3s has amazing lowlight capability because it has 12MP on a FF sensor. Consumer P&amp;Ss cram 20MP on a tiny sensor. Those are itty bitty photosites that have a ton of noise. Due to the noise, noise reduction is required, and that causes molting. "

"The same lens I'd get for full frame. Leica 35mm f/2 Summicron"
"I agree here. People have to have standards in both their treatment of wild animals and their photographing/observing of them. There are more people in the world now than there ever were; does this give us an excuse to expect poor treatment in either of these activities? I should hope not! One who has a large sombrero, when you saw people petting a wild animal and disturbing them with flash at night etc. I am sure you were not pleased, but just because they wanted to do that does it give them the right to? We cannot simply expect poor standards simply because there are so many physical areas of land that we call \"ours\" -- before us, everything was \"wild\" and we have to respect that. "
"If the lens and your camera are compatible you can use any lens for any kind of photography you choose. There are no rules, see things your way.\n\nBut you will probably need a tripod for night photography"

"I have a dumb noob question about my flash that Google can't seem to sufficiently answer.\n\nA Yongnuo YN-560 III and PC–3.5mm flash sync cable ([this one](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003WGR3PY/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)) just arrived today. The 560 seems to work perfectly fine when it's attached to the hotshoe; however, I can't get the cable to work. When I have the 3.5mm jack plugged into my K-5 the flash instantly fires when the PC jack touches the port, and when it's plugged in the flash refuses to do anything. I saw somewhere that actually the ends are supposed to be switched, and the 3.5mm jack is supposed to go into the flash (which is impossible with the 560)? Is this normal behavior, and I just have to buy a PC–PC cable?"
"It doesn't need ten photos but it helps show my creative side/give evidence when I say \"I do photography\" in the activities section. \n\nAs for what I'm trying to say... I think I find a lot of beauty in small things (hence the macros), but also in isolation from the rest of the world. I like the way bokeh and a wide aperture distracts and distorts the surroundings and focuses only on what I find beautiful (or ugly). "

"Ah shit, you're getting downvoted because this isn't a question thread.\n\nAnyway:\n\nNew digital cameras will always lose value, to minimise it, perhaps buy a second hand one, like you would a second hand car. And put more money in the lens than the body (buy a $200 camera with an $800 lens, rather than an $800 body with a $200 lens)."
"&gt; The wider the better there\n\nTo OP: in this particular situation, he's referring to the focal length. Wider lenses allow longer shutter speeds before stars start to produce trails."
"Copied and pasted from one of my comments on another thread:\n\nIt depends on whether you want star trails or not.\n\nIf you do want star trails, go for a 30s-2m exposure. Set your aperture to whatever you want (f/5.6-f/8 for maximum sharpness, wide open for minimum noise) and set your ISO accordingly. Stack your exposures, boom, star trails. Make sure you're on manual, and set your WB ahead of time so that everything is constant.\n\nIf you don't want star trails, divide 600 by your 35mm equivalent focal length, or 600 / (focal length * 1.6). This is called the rule of 600, and is the longest shutter speed you can have before your stars produce trails. Set your shutter speed to this. Set your aperture to whatever you want (f/5.6-f/8 for maximum sharpness, wide open for minimal noise) and set your ISO accordingly. Make sure you're on manual, and set your WB ahead of time so that everything is constant.\n\nA tripod is necessary, by the way."
"i would straight away take out 1,5 as 1 just seems dark/random to me and 5 is out of focus \n\nand the rest kind of depends what you want your portfolio to be about because anyone can go out and take images with a wide aperture and get effects like most of these have while they look nice it doesn't make them interesting having said that i do like images 3,4 and on your flikr you have some really good images of flowers you could add one or two in \n\n"
"I recently just got a Canon Powershot ELPH 330HS camera and I like it so far. It has a feature called \"Movie Digest\" that takes the first four seconds before you take a still picture and records it as a video. It then combines the clips into one big clip.\n\nI had it activated the past two days but now I seem to have turned it off. My questions are 1) How do I turn it back on? and 2) Can I still make the clip from my pictures while the feature wasn't active?"

"No, here's your misunderstanding, saving the file and defining it as 72dpi doesn't make an *8.5x11* 72dpi unless you specifically resample the image to that size in Photoshop or something.  If a 12mp camera is set to 72dpi, it will fit the 12mp to a page size at 72dpi when you print, if you don't simply override it when you print.  I.e.: a 12mp image set to 72dpi and printed at that size will print *four and a half feet wide*.  And if you print a 12mp image at 12\" wide, it will have a resolution of about 320dpi.  The DPI setting saved in the file doesn't change the file itself, its just a default print scale.  It is very nearly completely meaningless."

"You can pick one of the camera calibrations. "
"That's silly. Is there no official focus peaking?"
"As the others have written, the aperture works the same way - an f2 lens remains a f2 lens.  The focal length coupled with the sensor size will determine the field of view and hence the equivalent focal length.\n\nSince you are apparently considering acquiring a dSLR, let me add a couple of additional items that you might not realize.\n\n* Image Stabilization - can be either in the lens or in the body.  Nikon and Canon have their stabilization in their lenses, so you need to buy stabilized lenses.  Pentax and Sony has their stabilization in the body, so that what ever lens is mounted its stabilized.\n\n* Auto Focusing - Nikon and Canon have their auto focusing motors in their lenses, so you need to buy lenses with AF motors (particularly for entry level bodies).  Pentax uses in body AF motors, so that the lenses are simpler, less to break.  They also have lenses with AF motors and they are also supported by the bodies.\n\n* Older Lenses - Nikon and Canon have changed their mounts and interfaces over time, thus making it difficult to use older lenses.  Pentax has modernized their mounts while still retaining backward comparability, so that a 50 years old lens is still very useable."
"There is on e-m1 not on e-m5. It's not really needed the viewfinder is plenty bright but it would be nice to have no doubt. But this hack is pretty cool too when I need it. Also I don't use it with native lenses because auto focus is great."
"Olympus 14-42 (m4/3) vs. Samsung 20-50 (APS-C). The Olympus is 7mm smaller on the diameter, and 7 grams (6%) lighter. The Samsung is 10mm shorter, making it a touch more pocketable overall.\n\nAs for completeness, I agree that Sony's NEX range is a bit lacking, but Samsung's NX range is much better. I agree that it can't compete with m4/3 for sheer variety, but it certainly has all the main bases covered."
"I'll wait for my 135mm f/2 fixed lens camera with good Lightroom optimization. Sorry, Sigma. Love your sensors, but not your software. Would buy one if it worked with LR out of the box. Fuji could definitely slap a 58/85mm w/ leaf shutter on their X100 body and I'd buy it. "

"Happens all the time in uk too.  I get so angry when people don't consider the welfare of the bird when taking photos.

I feel like smashing their cameras up when they do that.  If it was the other way round my first thought would be they have approached that well I will stay put here so to not disturb and ruin all their hardwork.  It's not rocket science. \n\nOh and I had a go at someone continually disturbing a bird for a photo and his answer to me was \"fuck off Its not like I am killing it\".   I think this is the crux of the problem.  Stupid people who have got into wildlife photography.  "
"and yes to the pc-pc cable"
"I would say my Canon 40mm pancake. Compact, light, pretty handy focal length, fast 2.8, sharp and CHEAP. Lose it, break it, scratch it (ok that may be a bit difficult given the size of the front element) it is nice and easy to replace."
"35mm f/1.8 because it already does 90% of what I need.  I might like the Nikon 24-70 f/2.8 for its versatility, but it's kind of a heavy lens for an everyday shooter."
"Cool, thanks."
"Ahh I see, I guess I was more thinking about the qualities of being able to have the tangible pictures. Now a days we never develop photos like we used to. Everything gets stored up in computers or memory cards, perhaps Facebook and Instagram but we won't have those sites forever."
"I used to be one of those folks who would try to dissuade people from using 24-xx or 28-xx FF zooms on crop bodies for that reason, but then I realized that conflicts with my \"35/50 prime is all you need\" recommendations. "
"Number 1 is your best photo imo. I would remove number 7 because that picture has been taken by so many other people ( that flower, that close up, with that focus)."
"72 PPI days are gone.\n\nhttp://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_display.asp and various sources says that 1366 x 768 is the most popular screen resolution on average. That sounds to me like a 13/15 inch laptop, which translates into 120 PPI / 104 PPI. You might also want to consider the **significant** rise in popularity of iPhone type cameras that have 960x640 @ 330 PPI."
"I've been thinking about getting my first prime, tossing up between the nifty fifty and the 40mm pancake for a general walk around lens. Would you still recommend the 40mm on a crop sensor? 64mm (40mm * 1.6) sounds like a weird focal length."
"For people who just need time and exposure taking photos these can be great projects to get get some mileage.  I'm not saying that anyone's going to get 365 amazing photos but for new photographers it's great motivation to get them out and trying."
"All it takes is stillness and something that breaks the outline and people are practically blind to it."
"I think bayonet mount is the correct term, we just shorten it to bayonet. Lens mount is what the bayonet mount attaches to. "
"I'm not aware of any OVF focus-peaking options.  That's always been a feature of EVFs/LCDs."
"Exactly. You'd have the OVF, and a nice screen (as large as possible) with peaking."
"I don't really think I'd like relying on live view's shooting ergonomics for focus peaking though, especially with fast manual glass where slight movement of the camera can change the plane of focus."
"I agree that it isn't the best option. If it had a good OVF with a split/micro prism setup, most people would probably prefer that. But in this context (a non-AF Df), a peaking implementation in Live View would probably still be appreciated by many."
"Four thirds of a stop is no small deal. It's a huge difference. People pay big money to get f/2.8 zooms instead of f/4, and f/1.8 vs f/2.8 is an even bigger difference."

"I totally agree - the [Samsung 85mm f1.4](http://www.photozone.de/samsungnx/731_samsung85f14) is a real beauty!\n\nEDIT: Ah, I just realised you said 85-90mm *equivalent*, so something more like the [Samsung 60mm f2.8](http://www.ephotozine.com/article/samsung-60mm-f-2-8-nx-i-function-macro-lens-review-18463) then."
"She needs to drop her 400mm on the way back to her vehicle at the same destroying her memory cards.\n\nAbsolutely agree with you. Wildlife photography is exactly that - it's photography of wild life meaning photos of life in the wild, in their natural habitat devoid of human direction. One simply isn't a wildlife photographer if they are any more than a priviledged observer behind a lens."

"/r/multicopter would probably be a better place to ask than here.\n\nIts generally very difficult for multicopter guys to make any kind of real money from realestate due to the travel times, short flight job, and usually exceedingly high expectations for a usually small wage.\n\nYour example is not a very good indicator of a professional service*, and anyone who can fly legally, will not be using a $600 package and GoPro. They can give nice results if setup and flown properly, but thats not important in this case.\n\n&gt;How much to pay for his services?\n\nAs to how much you should pay, well thats entirely up to who you are getting. If you get someone who is properly setup/authorised to do these tasks, then they will have a price. Its not uncommon for AP and film prices to go &gt;1000 a day, but it would be different in your case I would think.\n\nIts expensive to do properly due to expensive gear, insurance, transport and any official costs associated with being 'legal'. Doing this on the cheap doesn't really happen at the professional level, and its only the professionals who have clearance from their aviation authority to work commercially.\n\n&gt; What kind of shots/views I should commission?\n\nThere are plenty of examples of what people have been doing for realestate. [This](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTKW_l4f9yA) [and this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-w-0zeWW-8) [and this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhmTa6NHGE&amp;t=16) from some random people I take a passing interest in. Look at other videos they have as well. There are three distinct levels of quality between those guys, from highly professional (cinechopper) to very high amature levels. \n\nYou treat it like normal photography, but without any restriction on position. Best shots show the surrounds of the property and the views. Leverage the unique angles to capture something more impressive than traditionally possible. \n\n&gt;What the potential value this service would provide?\n\nLots. Depending on your client base and the value of the homes it could really help sell. Its up to you to determine the real value to your package over traditional photos.\n\nThese kinds of services are usually only possible for high value homes. [This is a good example](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slTSTGF9Kzo) of how it can be used well. \n\n\nIf you have any more questions, feel free to ask.\n\n\n\n*Obligatory safety note: Your example shows flight over people, in heavy city areas and more. This is exceptionally irresponsible and dangerous behaviour. These are also not *drones* but remote controlled multicopters. Calling them RC Helicopters is also fine."
"There was a time that monitors were 72dpi so we thought that pictures had to be set at this.    \nDifferent monitors have different ~~dpi~~ ppi. So they display an image in that ~~dpi~~ ppi. It doesn't matter what the ~~dpi~~ppi is set at.    \n    \nWhen printing, ~~\"ppi\"~~ \"dpi\" is important. You want to set the resolution to match a printers output."
"Always nice to gain a new X-friend! Updating your firmware is step one. It really helps.\n\nSecond, set your function buttons. I have ISO as the top function button, and the RAW button set so that I can chose between fine/normal/normal+RAW/RAW etc. On a smaller camera, one hand shooting is pretty sweet.\n\nOf all the digital cameras that I've used (Canon Powershot G10, 5d classic, Pentax Ksomething), the Fuji menu system is my favourite. I was given a Fuji 3D camera for Christmas and the menu system is so similar that I slid right into using it. It's easy to use once you know where everything is, but to be honest most of what you'll need is binded to a button anyway.\n\nCustomise your viewfinders before you set out too. You can change what you see in the hybrid and electronic viewfinder. Fair warning though, what you see in live view isn't really representative of the final exposure. It's one of my biggest issues with the camera, which I've used non-stop for long enough that I can't even remember how long it's been.\n\nYou'll probably have to focus/recompose more than you're used to. I'm very used to the autofocus but still it can hunt at times. The firmware updates help SO much with this. Point at something with contrast, have a decent aperture, recompose, and you're fine. If you learn how the autofocus works you'll be able to anticipate when you'll struggle and be able to adjust accordingly. Most of the negative stuff I've seen posted online has come from people who haven't used the camera for very long.\n\nIt being smaller and looking the way it does, people tend to either ignore you or get super stoked thinking that you're shooting film. Well done on getting a black one, I sometimes feel a bit conspicuous with my silver/black one.\n\nFeel free to ask any questions you may have, and good luck! Welcome to the gang!"
"The Canon 50mm 1.8 may seem cheap &amp; plastic but it holds up better than the 1.4.  The 1.8 is sharper at some apertures too.  Either way the 50mm will be the sharpest thing in your bag.  not worth the extra $200 for something that is so frail.  Here is a long list of YouTube videos on how to fix  the \"but it has better build quality!!\" 1.4 http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=repair+canon+50mm+1.4&amp;sm=3"
"Getting model releases from Grizzly Bears is a nightmare. Seriously though, cannot up vote this post enough. Whatever happened to waiting for the shot and enjoying the anticipation?"
"I apologize.  I came across as aloof.  I take shots at my local parks in the urban center of Chicago and just last week got a cool picture of an American Kestrel perched on a chimney across the street.\n\nYou were right to post this.  I guess I'm just jaded, having traveled Central America for the past few years and witnessing some really bad behavior in some really pristine settings.\n\nBut it's New Year's Day, and we can all be optimists today!  All the best to you in the coming year."
"Happy New Year to you too!\n\nI can understand being jaded. Last year (it feels weird writing that) I spent six months living in a big national park in southern Africa. I saw some awful behaviour in regards to animals, but I saw a lot of good stuff too."
"To both of your questions: yes. There is a reason people spend big $$ on photo gear BUT your 3100 will take glorious pictures. For landscape, a tripod, a good one, not a cheap one will be your best investment. Then, I would go with a polarizer and some ND filters.\n\nYou didn't say what lens you have but wide angle is the most traditional for landscape. You can rent lenses for that once in a lifetime trip. "
"If I use go with the Tamron 17-35, won't I still be getting a wider field of view because it is an ultra wide angle lens?  I'm sure the Tokina will also do this for me, but won't I be sacrificing some distance with the zoom because it is an 11-16 mm??"
"I started using [blipfoto](http://www.blipfoto.com/) in November and will be using it for a 365 project this year. I know people that have used it to track multiple 365 projects. \n\nYour photos are easily accessible in a calendar/journal format and friends can comment on them too. Really recommend it! Good luck with your 365!"
"What is the best website to order RAW image prints from?  I'm interested in ordering larger prints(8x10 and up).  I have been on some sites where they give the option to order poster size prints on a satin paper roll.  Is this acceptable to put a RAW image on?  Or is there a better option where the quality of the image won't be sacrificed or could be better?"

"&gt; Having the JPEG around is the only way to see what the camera would have done with the enhancements to the saturation, tone, sharpness, and contrast.\n\nWhy in the world would you care about \"what the camera would have done?\"  Why would you substitute your own expertise on how the shot should look for some preset built into the camera?\n\n"

"It's not a question of how it is displayed, simply how it is described.  The system displaying it might use the \"dpi\" to describe the size of the image, though it wouldn't change the 100% pixel view.\n\nFrom what I could tell (since I'd never gone to look this up, just vaguely remembered the 72dpi rule) it was a historical issue relating to how apple setup their monitors (such that a 10pt character in a certain font would be the same size on screen as printed).  I don't know, though, I just never mess with dpi until I go to print an image.\n\nThis is where I got that:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dots_per_inch#Computer_monitor_DPI_standards"

"The name doesn't mean anything, the focal length does. The 17-35 is only 1mm wider than your 18-55 (5.6% wider), which is barely anything, whereas the 11-16 is 7mm wider (61.1% wider). You will be sacrificing the long end with that zoom, but that shouldn't be a problem from landscapes. *Every* lens has a sacrifice, whether it's IQ, aperture, price, or zoom range."

"DxO must have gotten a bad copy in Canon mount or screwed that test up, because the Nikon version peaks at f/5.6 as expected in their tests. \n\nEdit: nope, it only does that at 18mm, and any longer focal length is still sharper at f/4 than f/5.6. What black magic is this?"

"I got into photography only a year ago and primarily shoot film. For digital, I have a Canon PowerShot G15 which has largely been adequate for my purposes. However, I'm looking to take the plunge into strobist stuff and am trying to determine the best way in which I might proceed:\n\nOne idea of mine was to simply get a speedlight, but in order to use it off-camera I'd have to probably get into all the wireless stuff or buy a PC sync adapter for the hot shoe. The G15 doesn't have its own sync port, and beyond that I'm not sure how much control I can even exert over external flash through the camera (of course, I'd buy something with manual capabilities because I'm not looking for TTL).\n\nThe other idea was to buy a slave flash, like the ones [made by Impact](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/877222-REG/Impact_SF_DSXN40_Mini_Slave_Flash.html). But this might be complicating things. I assume that if I obstruct the G15's flash so that it doesn't reach the subject, the pulse of light will still be prominent enough to trigger the slave. Then I hear issues about compact cameras which use a pre-flash before firing, although you can set the G15's flash to either fire at the opening or closing curtain and I suppose that would cover that issue. Of course, the problem with most of these cheap slave strobes is that control over them seems virtually nonexistent, and if the light fires during the entire duration of the exposure, I might have to go to excessive lengths to diminish it. Or perhaps this is what everybody does?\n\nThoughts?"
"I would say no, but that's because I like panoramas of the night sky.\nDo a google image search for \"cannon 50 mm 1.8 night sky\" and see what you'll get in terms of framing.\n\nIf you don't want star trails, as some one else explained your exposure needs to be lower than 7.5 seconds ( 600/(50 * 1.6)).\nI suppose you'll need a higher ISO for a 7.5 seconds exposure and APS-C sensors don't perform so well noise-wise at higher ISO."
"I always have the feeling that dslr-&gt;dsml comparison is comparing a 5D MK3 with a Panasonic G1 (biggest, best DSLR with cheapest, oldest DSML). That's why I like to point to the fact that there are high end DSML cameras."

"I'm completely on the side of mirrorless, was just pointing out the common differences.  Most people don't seem to realise what these are in the first place. "
"If you look at camera spec sheets and how many shots the battery is rated for, DSLRs can go for much longer. And here's my bit of anecdotal evidence: I made a 3-day trip with my dad last summer. He had a Fuji X-E1, I had a Nikon D7000. We both started with fully charged batteries. His ran out in the middle of the first day, mine lasted the entire trip. And I took more photos too.\n\nMirrorless cameras focus on stationary objects just fine. Tracking the subject with continuous AF is the problem. I'm glad you'ree happy with yours, but there's a reason why most pros don't use them."
"Didn't thought you were taking sides, just pointing out :)"
"As a bird photographer, this pisses me off to no end. No shot is worth putting the bird in danger.\n\nWhere I shoot, only trusted ethical photographers are now told about new birds and birding spots. Otherwise it's a crapshoot of over zealous photographers driving off trails, getting too close to nests, etc.\n\nThe big Indian nature photography sites now totally ban photos of nests, nesting birds, and chicks without their parents because of unethical behavior by some photographers. "
"PC-PC. The K5 has a PC port, your flash has a PC port.\n\nOr go wireless with YN radio triggers, because PC cables are already pretty damn expensive for cables and you are not so much limited by distance, position and tripping over the whole damn thing, taking all your gear with you crashing to the ground."
"I'm personally on the side of mirror less, for me, not necessarily everyone! "
"Well I'm using the Autofocus constantly, partly in Continous Mode. Why? I'm shooting Models and Live Music Concerts, the subjects are moving a lot.\n\nI hear \"there's a reason why most pros don't use them\" often. None of them asked could tell me the reason why they wouldn't use a mirrorless. Most of them are just used to equipment on which they learned photography 5- X years ago. Or they were teached by somewhone with a a Canon/Nikon equivalent, that's why they also are using this setup.\n\nI think it's clear that using a very large and heavy dslr is something you also want to do for image reasons. If you can't afford a hasselblad, then at least get a Mk3 with a BFL (Big Fucking Lense). It's true, Models and Agencies alike think you are a more a pro if you got big gear. I sometimes get looks on my smaller Setup...until the first photos hit the livescreen ;)"
"Why would you not take both?\n\nThey're extremely different lenses. If you don't already know your style and preferred focal length for that kind of occasion, I'm not sure what the advice of uninformed strangers is going to do for you."
"I used them back in 2010. At the time I wrote a review for the local photography club. Here's what I said. Keep in mind this was more than 3 years ago. Their pricing model has changed somewhat and their site may have improved (I haven't used it since).\n\nA pretty common question is “what scanner should I buy to scan in my cherished family negatives?”. The common response is “don’t bother, it sucks. Outsource it to Scancafe.”\n\nI am firmly in the “it sucks” camp, so I outsourced to www.scancafe.com. I signed up for their mailing list and watched for a buy $150 gift card/get $150 deal. Once I got that, I sent in my negatives.\n\nPros\n\n* They scanned 1569 frames for me. I didn’t have to scan a single one myself.\n* The final image quality of the scans was very nice\n* They organized the images into folders based on the raw notes I’d scribbled on bags/slide holders/etc\n\nCons\n\n* Holy crap did it take a long time for them to get them done\n* Holy crap is their website the crappiest crap crap that ever crapped. I mean really. Holy crap!\n* They force you to take 50% of the scans\n\nDetails\n\nI estimated 917 images when I sent them in, a mix of 35mm colour negs, 35mm B&amp;W negs, APS, 127mm colour slide, 110mm colour neg, and 35mm slides. I was a little off on my total, which caused them to miss their guaranteed delivery date (guarantee was for 1000 images or less). My total bill, including shipping, was $292.86.\n\nI shipped my slides to them on November 17th. They arrived at their US address on the November 19th. They started scanning them on December 9th. I got a notification on December 29th that the images were ready for review. I completed the review on December 31st. I received no return shipping notification on the DVD or negatives, and they arrived about two weeks ago. So, don’t go with Scancafe if you need the scans done in a hurry.\n\nThe quality of the scans is just fine. None of the images are fine-art, they’re just family memories and such. I can easily make prints, post them to the web, whatever with the quality I got. Sorry no samples to include, they’re all at home on the DVD.\n\nScancafe’s front website looks beautiful and is very inviting. The actual web interface for selecting the images you want to keep is horrific. Really. I mean god awful painful. It’s slow, the thumbnails are tiny, I was constantly accidentally unchecking things. Having said that, it only took me three hours to go through all 1569 images, which is way way way less time than any hand scanning on my part would take. So I dealt with the crappy web interface.\n\nMy one other nit is that they force you to take 50% of the scans. I have no problem at all paying for 50% of the scans, but you have to take 50%. That means when you’re working through all the images on the website and deleting ones you don’t want eventually you’ll get to a point where you are given an ugly dialog that says “sorry, you can’t delete anymore”. Then you just have to order the rest and continue sorting through after the DVD arrives. Stupid.\n\nAnyway, that’s my review. Overall it’s a hell of a lot better than scanning the images yourself. "
"Renting it for a couple of weeks? How expensive is that? You could get the lens for a little more maybe forever! Or if you go used, you could get the lens for the rental price maybe.\n\nIn my opinion both focal lengths are useful and can create beautiful pictures. No matter how you decide you will be disappointed when you want to take an UWA landscape or when you want to take shallow depth of field portraits. Environmental portraits with the Sigma might be a viable compromise? Or buying the Sigma used and buying a 50/1.8 used too or new depending on the budget?"
"I started one in 2013 and finished it yesterday. I would highly recommend it if you're looking for a way to get out there and get motivated"
"However, the D3200 does not have a screw drive motor in the body - so its limited to manual focus or AF lenses with motors.  Also, a lot of the entry level camera bodies have pentamirrors in the view finders rather than pentaprisms.  That coupled with just small viewfinders for entry level bodies contributes to this.  The more advanced the body the more features it supports.\n\n"

"What other lenses do you have?  Or, do you just have a body sans lenses?"
"I'd like to second what Xkey2 said. If you're renting for more than two weeks, the rental cost is going to add up. If you like the Sigma 10-20, just get one on ebay. I just checked completed listings, and they go from about 280-440 fairly reliably. If you buy low and re-sell high eventually, your net income might end up positive, rather than renting where your income will always be negative.\n\nEspecially considering the fact that you've used it and already know you like it, renting it again is just throwing money away.\n\nSame with the Sigma... 50/1.4 is nice, but why not just buy a 50/1.8 or a 40mm? Especially on the 50mm lens, rental cost for two weeks is going to be more than the price of a reasonably similar lens. \n\nRenting seems like a nice option, especially on limited budget, but you have to think long term; with three months to shop on ebay you can find a good deal, and turn around and sell it again and make money (or just keep it and enjoy it). "
"Thanks for all the replies - I have some research to do! \n\nWhat about darkroom setups? Who here does their own darkroom stuff?"
"Ask the people who would pay for this service, what they want to have done, figure out how to accommodate that expectation and return with an estimate that covers your costs + whatever makes it worth for you to do this rather than work on something else. Don't speculate in how to milk a client for the most possible money, figure out what it's worth for you. If that's a steal for your client, great, you both are happy with the deal. If they can't afford you, well then it's not worth it for you, because you where honest in your estimate.\n\nIf you are giving them rebates for giving you special rights for the photos etc., make that clear in the contract and estimate.\n\nIf you do not already have a ready contract, consider using a template as a starting point and add/subtract whatever details you need to document the agreement between you and the customer. I use a modified version of[ Contact Killer 3](https://gist.github.com/malarkey/4031110).\n\nIn you back and forth, set realistic but firm deadlines for correspondence, that way you know by which time to expect a reply, and what time to give them a reminder.

"&gt;  I'd have to probably get into all the wireless stuff\n\nYongnuo RF-603 triggers are like $30 for a pair. I'm not sure if they're work with a PowerShot though. If they do, all you have to do is stick one in your hotshoe and one on your flash, and you're good. It's not complicated at all.\n\n&gt; I'm not sure how much control I can even exert over external flash through the camera\n\nI don't think Canon has something in-camera that allows you to control OCF, but I don't see why setting the flash on the flash itself would be a problem.\n\n&gt; The other idea was to buy a slave flash\n\nA lot of flashes have built-in optical slave modes already. The one that you linked looks too small to be useful though.\n\n&gt; Then I hear issues about compact cameras which use a pre-flash before firing, although you can set the G15's flash to either fire at the opening or closing curtain and I suppose that would cover that issue.\n\nI'm fairly sure there will still be a preflash. There's a mode on some flashes to ignore preflashes in slave mode, but I haven't done any tests to see how effective it actually is.\n\n&gt; if the light fires during the entire duration of the exposure, I might have to go to excessive lengths to diminish it.\n\nFlashes fire at a fraction of a second (anywhere from 1/1000 to 1/40000 of a second, depending on the power level), much faster than your sync speed unless you're using high-speed sync. In fact, as long as you're shooting slower than your sync speed, the shutter speed doesn't affect how powerful the flash is *at all*. The only thing that affects flash power in your exposure is aperture and ISO. Shutter speed only affects ambient light. If you shoot faster than your sync speed, then you only get a portion of your image exposed, which is an entirely different scenario."
"Generally, with my limited experience on wildlife photography, it pays off way better to be silent, motionless, and the smallest nuisance you can really be. If I see an animal, I sure as hell won't scare it away to get a picture of a scared animal.\n\nEven the most simple creatures, like squirrels, magpies and such can show unseen characteristics and actions if you let them be at peace, and it is these moments that the best pictures are taken.\n\nIt is a mutual understanding -- when you are photographing, you are not supposed to be a threat and sometimes the animals understand this as well."
"This is great. A few small adjustments and the improvement is very visible. Now it comes down to practice. Keep taking pictures, experiment and see what works well for you. Look at the photographs you're most happy with and examine the metadata - ask why is this shot better than that shot etc. And read - photo magazines, books by photographers, books of photographs. You never stop learning. "
"If you don't have phenomenal work to put in a portfolio and it's not required, don't put it on your application.  \n\nYou would have to be applying to a *really* high end school for them to care what your photography is like / brings to the table for their school enough for it to matter.  As in, Harvard, Dartmouth, cornell, UVM, and the University of Rochester *all* didn't care either way if I submitted a portfolio.  \n\nIt's optional, but my admissions counselor at UR said it was like a peer recommendation after the first one.  It's there, but they won't even look at it.  On my visit to Dartmouth, the admissions staff said it might move you from a no to a low end wait list, but doesn't come into play much higher than that.  UVM accepted me with a $48,000 offer without a portfolio, and I did not visit harvard or cornell and haven't heard back from them.  \n\nDon't submit this portfolio.  Just don't submit a portfolio."

"dpi is dots per inch, or the resolution cap of the final product.  It's entirely meaningless on a digital file, as you can change it anyway.  You could make a 6000dpi file from a crap-n-shoot if you wanted, or from a medium format camera if you wanted. "
"I'm a Tusconite! (I'm not sure if that is even what we actually call ourselves.)  I assume you will still have the Nikon D3100.  The 10-20mm is not what i will consider a portrait lens.  That said, you can still get creative shots with groups.  \n\nWhile i do not have the Sigma F1.4, I do have a Nikkor 50mm F/1.4.  I personally do not like that lens on a crop sensor (actually i don't like it too much on a full frame!)  I was much happier with a 35mm on a crop sensor. I love the natural view of the 35mm.  The 50MM is very tight.  I always had to go right inside the action.  \n\nBut to answer your question, out of the two lenses you asked about I would probably choose the 10-20mm.  I have a Tokina 11-16MM and i love it so much better than the 50mm.\n\nAlso, The 10-20MM will also allow you to get some of our amazing sunsets down there in all its glory."

"Nice how-to video.\n\nYour vid is good too. "
"I'll chime in here with a principal observation. As long as you chase the artistic perspective buy renting lenses you'll deprive yourself of improving your eye. You already have the basically fundamental lens and aperture concept down. Looking at your album indicates you still need to find the difference between taking pictures and composing photographs. My advice, buy a fast zoom. 20 to 70mm 1.8. And build a stable foundation that will expand your portfolio. Something constant to manipulate composition and subject matter. With confidence in a constant piece of glass you can venture away from \"Auto\" mode and really work with available light. Good luck, you have already accepted the challenge.     "
"Different strokes!\n\nMy style is longer focal lengths, but 70-200 was too long for me on crop. 24-70 had great quality but not enough reach for me. 28-135 was a great range but middling quality. 24-105 was a great quality/reach compromise.\n\nOn full frame, 70-200 is great for me and I barely use the 24-105 anymore."
"Acceptable isn't really the right word here.  It's a style, you will see just as many guides discussing how to add warmth, or remove it, to make an image look \"better\".  It's subjective.  Photography isn't *always* about reproducing exactly what you see, it's about art and storytelling."

"Your photo has no story.

My work was lacking direction, which means it was basically going nowhere. And you can see the lack of direction when you check the negatives. I love photography and have no desire to quit, but unless you have structure you are just shooting blind and wasting film. So this year I shall be looking at putting together some projects that will help motivate me to get shooting and get shooting properly.\nhttp://www.japancamerahunter.com/2012/01/new-year-time-for-a-project/\nDespite me writing this piece 2 years ago, I still think it has some good points.\n\nThese are great advice from JCH."
"Use white balance to make the colors how you want.\n\nSometimes that means putting it at neutral off a gray card. Sometimes that means leaving it as shot. Sometimes that means starting with neutral or as shot and then pushing it one way or the other.\n\nPhotography is an art and white balance is an artistic decision. There is no one right answer for all situations. Gray card white balance is one option and it can help beginners understand white balance by learning about it, but ultimately it's your artistic decision whether to follow it or not."
"28mm 1.8\n\nBecause that FOV (around 42mm on FX) is fantastic."
"Here's a similar story;\n\nTwo months ago thought that I'd like to do a night shoot of Petra, the local Bedouins organize a three hour candle light show a few times a week.\n\nWhen I arrived there were around four other professionally equipped photographers among a group of 50 people, anyway we all start walking down the canyon towards the treasury and one of the photographers pulls out this high powered pure white LED light and just started ceaselessly painting everything with white light, it was really annoying since there was a major difference between the the glow of the candles and the stark white LED light and no one got the chance to take a decent picture without him painting everything around him throughout.\n\nit got so frustrating that another photographer actually started shouting at him to stop and let everybody enjoy the atmosphere and take pictures, the guy just stared blankly at him turned and continued! at that point I decided to leave as I wasn't going to get a decent shot. \n\nas a Jordanian, it didn't bother me too much because I visit it often. but just imagine those poor people who had paid all that money and traveled all that way to visit and take pictures and some self-entitled asshole didn't have the manners to think about others."

"This is a pretty fucking cool way of presenting stories."
"DPI is a measurement of a printers capability, the term you mean is PPI.\nIf you set your camera to the highest quality setting you will have the highest image quality you camera can produce regardless of what PPI the image is set at.  The PPI can be changed post processing and it will not reduce or improve the IQ.  Resampling the image and lowering the PPI will lower the IQ, pixels will be deleted from the image resulting in a smaller file size.  Resampling also reduces the MP of an image.  Remember \"Resampling\".\nDisregarding historical reasons, today it is common for many websites to want you to submit images at 72ppi (they mean resampled too) because they have a much smaller file to host on their servers. \n\nWith todays cameras a higher MP count does not guarantee a better IQ, you are correct in stating it allows for larger prints.  Todays most common resolution for displays is 1920x1080 which is roughly 2MP.  Generally the image sensor size is what determines quality (disregarding glass for now).  Larger sensors are in DSLRs and now the fairly new mirrorless cameras.  Simple point and shoots and cell phones have smaller sensors and generally a lesser IQ especially in lower light circumstances.  \n\nDo not let people confuse you with mirrorless cameras as simple point and shoots.  Someone here compared a Sony RX1 to a Nikon D3200 and claimed that a P&amp;S is just as good IQ as a DSLR.  Not True.\nThis is an extremely bad comparison.  The RX1 is a $2,800 full frame mirrorless camera, the D3200 is a $400 crop sensor camera.  Simple point and shoots have a much smaller sensor than both of those cameras and a much lower IQ as well.\n\nThe bottom line, your images will be at their best IQ if you set your camera to the highest quality and do not resample your images before posting them online.  FYI some websites will resample the images you upload to them."

"Contact Amazon's customer service. I found an article on here talking about counterfeit CF cards. I looked for the signs in mine and discovered that my 32gb card was possibly a fake. It would still hold the space, but didn't have the write speed as advertised, which explained why it never seemed to work for video. Anyway, it had been a year at this point, but I decided to contact them and give them the information about the fakes, and what made me think mine was a fake. They credited my account the $100 or so I spent on the card, and they allowed me to keep the fake, which is still quite functional.\n\nIf you bring it to their attention, they will likely take care of it."
"Yes, higher DPI can mean finer detail in the print, assuming you're not upscaling the pixel count and assuming that the lens and system were good enough to show detail on a per-pixel level at that resolution. If the lens projected a blurry image, it doesn't matter how many pixels you used to record that blur, or how many dots you use to print that blur. And all lenses hit that limit if you go far down enough&amp;mdash;it's just a matter of how far down you can go.\n\n&gt; consumer grade camera and it arbitrarily forces an 8.5 x 11 to 72 dpi, and if i take a DSLR which will give me the option to use the raw file and port down to an 8.5 x 11 tiff at 300 dpi (or whatever format i want, at whatever higher dpi i want)\n\nEither one can be printed at whatever DPI you want. It's arbitrary and only limited by your pixel count. The camera might attach a DPI figure to the file but you're not bound by it.\n\nIf an image is 6000x3000 pixels (18mp) you can print it at 300 DPI to 20\" by 10\" (6000 pixels divided by 300 pixels per inch and 3000 pixels divided by 300 pixels per inch). Or you can print it at 150 DPI to 40\" by 20\". Or whatever you want. The math works the same no matter what type of camera it came from.\n\n&gt; isn't it likely that the quality of the dslr be better, since it'll have more dots per inch, which means more data, which means finer detail?\n\nThe DSLR does not inherently have a higher DPI since that's arbitrary for either one. Nor does it necessarily have a higher DPI potential because that's based on total pixel count, and there are plenty of point &amp; shoot cameras with a higher pixel count than plenty of DSLRs.\n\nIf you take one photo from one camera, any camera, assuming you have pixel-level detail, you will have finer detail per inch when printing at a higher DPI.\n\nIf you're comparing photos from typical point &amp; shoot to a typical DSLR at the same resolution and DPI, the DSLR will likely have better image quality because of the larger sensor and better optics. The DSLR is more likely to have per-pixel detail or more likely to be closer to that than a point &amp; shoot at the same resolution."
"Yeah they're both really neat"
"Definitely worth a reshoot."
"Because this is photography and all of the world is just a resource for making good images."
"&gt;acceptable \n\nI've never heard that word used in that way when it comes to white balance.   You adjust it as you see fit / wish for any number of reasons.  \n\nMaybe sometimes you want to *accurately represent the scene as seen by the eye* maybe sometimes you don't *accurately represent the scene as seen by the eye*.\n\nAlso I will note that if you're trying to be as accurate as possible, memory is a tricky thing, it isn't as accurate as you might think.  The camera certainly doesn't always capture what the eye sees, but memory doesn't either ;)"
"Press F11 to get fullscreen and enjoy the images that way if you want the best experience!"
"Looking again at your other posts, it looks like you might be under the impression that the raw file (from a DSLR or otherwise) is some analog construct with which you can split into any number of pixels. My mistake and apologies if that's not the case.\n\nTo clarify, a raw is just another form of digital image that uses pixels and is limited by its own pixel dimensions. Look at any raw file or the specs page for any camera that shoots raw and you can see the raw resolution, measured in pixels. This maximum comes about from the physical photosites on the image sensor and how they're interpreted through the Bayer array or a similar array. Further reading here:\n\nhttp://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/camera-sensors.htm\n\nWhile a raw can be exported to a jpeg of any pixel size, you're just asking the software to interpolate the additional pixels if you want a jpeg with more pixels than the raw originally had. It's the same as taking a jpeg and resizing it larger. You're not gaining any detail because the additional data for the additional detail doesn't exist; the software is just guessing what should be there based on what is already there.\n\nSo like a jpeg from a point &amp; shoot with a finite number of pixels, raws have a finite number of pixels and thus an upper limit on detail that can be represented in the file."

"Convenience and for the hell of it. I don't need third- or half-stop accuracy, so those are out to enable me to switch faster and use the physical ring on my X100 easy. \n\nf/1.4 is a wide full-stop aperture. \n\nf/2 was previously common on primes, and is the widest full-stop on my 85/1.8 and former 50/1.8; also wide open for the 135L. It's easy on the eyes\n\nf/2.8 is where most fast zooms lie. It just feels nice. It's wide open for my 300L and Rokinon 14mm, both of which are excellent at that aperture. It's the marker for when a lens becomes fast. \n\nf/4 is a good standard aperture. It's stopped down for a majority of quality lenses and is the sharpest aperture for many lenses. \n\nf/5.6 is an ugly turd. Just the numbers look ugly to me. It's the slow end on a lot of cheap kit lenses. It's neither fast nor slow: the middle child. \n\nf/8 and be there. Good sharpness with a lot more depth of field than f/4. \n\nf/11 is often the last stop before diffraction takes its toll. It allows me to slow my shutter speed or finish off the rest of the ambient lighting when I bring out the flash. "
"For amateurs I'd say the kit 18-55. When you've developed your personal style go out and get a high quality, expensive lens in that aspect range. A really good lens in the hands of a bad photographer is a waste of money.\n\nPersonally I like my Canon 40mm 2.8 pancake the most, but I'll put the kit lens back on if I'm going to need something wider, it's sharp enough for my amateur use at f5."
"&gt; As I adjust a bunch of kids come running \"Look a Deer\" and scare that deer and it runs off. \n\nWere these \"kids\" younger than about 10 years? In this case I couldn't even be mad. That's the way children that young enjoy nature; they run for it. I did that too, when I was that young and now I'm ecologist. If this is in a \"park/garden\" as you described the animals also are used to anthropogenic stress.\n\nBut that other kid willingly harming an animal just is a case of bad parenting."
"This is something I've seen among many photographers, both those who are beginners, and those who have been doing it for quite some time. There's a part of them that gets hung up on the ways that a camera changes a scene. Instead of embracing this, and seeing how this scene improves, they only see the fact that it's different as an annoyance or misrepresentation. While that's fine, it seems to me that these people need to realize that for many people, photography doesn't have to be a pure representation of what your eyes see at the time. There's so much more to it than that. \n\nEven composing the image itself is altering what is seen by the eye. You weren't laying down on the sidewalk to look at a scene, but that's how you might compose it for a photo. You generally don't focus on something at the top right of your field of vision, but that might be where it's placed in the photograph. Changing something's orientation in the frame itself, and changing the point from which it's viewed is completely altering the experience from a person's normal vantage point, and thus, what their eyes would have likely seen in the first place.\n\nAdditionally, the use of a camera itself doesn't accurately represent the way you see things. Your eyes are extremely complex and communicate images to our brains entirely differently than a camera communicates an image to film or a sensor. Consider your street light scenario again. Say there's a street light shining on the right side of an otherwise unlit road. You want to meter for that street light to be properly exposed. By doing this, you underexpose the rest of the street to the point that it is entirely black. At this point, all that will be present in your image is the street light and that which it shines on. In reality though, your eyes would be able to distinguish the darkened street. You'd be able to see the other houses and the cars parked some distance ahead. The painted lines would extend some distance ahead of you. Of course this all changes depending on natural lighting from the moon and stars, but the point remains. Your eyes can distinguish far more than a camera.\n\n Also consider the way we focus our eyes. When we focus on something, all that which we aren't focused on generally melts away. It's there within our field of vision, and if we actively try to see it we will. However, we generally don't actively experience this. Consider right now, while you're reading this, there's something behind your computer screen that you likely hadn't noticed until just now. You knew it was there, but you weren't actively focusing on it, and it wasn't a part of your vision or your experience until I pointed it out. Compare that to a photo. The subject is one aspect of a photograph, and its surroundings are another. Even the furthest, blurriest parts of a photo can add to their beauty and experience. They're portions that we would otherwise certainly overlook. In a photograph though, they become just as much of a part of the image as the subject itself. Is this really an accurate representation of the scene as we would experience it in real life?\n\nFinally, consider that an integral part of photography is the exclusion of external stimuli. I'm going to use my own example of my suburban town for this. If I went into the woods right now and took a picture of a deer in the snow then that is what you would see. Maybe I communicate it as something serene. Or, maybe this is a photograph about survival, and the urgent need for shelter in the colder months. Regardless, that is what you would see. However, that is not nearly what the photographer experienced, nor is it what you would likely experience in the same situation. While taking that photo I would be able to hear the highway a few miles behind me. Maybe a train blows its whistle in the next town over. At noon they set off a single fire alarm in my town, maybe I heard that while snapping the photo. Now consider that there's more than just auditory stimuli being excluded from this experience. Maybe there's a dead raccoon just outside the frame of the photo. He isn't being included, but he's certainly there and a part of the experience. Maybe I can smell him while I take the photo. Once again, that isn't something I can communicate to you. It isn't even something I want to communicate to you in my photo, but it's something I'm experiencing when I'm out there.\n\nThe point I'm trying to make is that while you're worrying about a misrepresentation of your vision, you're completely ignoring the fact that photography itself is a misrepresentation of reality. Photographs are taken from weird angles that you would otherwise ignore. Photography doesn't communicate all that our eyes communicate. Finally, photography doesn't communicate every aspect of a scene. The photographer actively chooses what he or she wants to communicate with a photograph.\n\nIf you still believe that visual misrepresentation isn't proper photography, then by all means don't adjust the white balance accordingly. It's all personal preference really. I'm not trying to sway you one way or the other. This is simply my perception of photography, and the way I've come to understand the question you're asking. Just understand that this isn't really a question of whether something is \"acceptable\". It's more of a question regarding your own photographic standards, and whether or not it would be acceptable for you, or to you."
"You can use any EF or EF-S lens on the 60D.\n\nNikon doesn't have a *direct* equivalent. 60D probably sits somewhere between the d90 and d7000 spec and performance-wise.\n\nDepending on the lenses you have, you will probably get a lot more benefit spending money on lenses than on the body first, though the 60D certainly us ergonomically nicer."
"This should probably go in the [questions thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/1u2lgm/heres_my_question_daily_thread_for_everything_you/) linked in the sidebar and dropdown menu.\n\nThe D7000 is closest, releasing around the same time in the same market position. Preceded by the D90 and succeeded by the D7100.\n\n&gt; I'm looking to upgrade from my current T3.\n\nWhat improvements are you looking for?\n\n&gt; Which makes me wonder if I could use my lenses for my T3 in the 60D?\n\nYes.

"Just buy a 50mm 1.8. You'll use it. Then you can still rent the zoom. \n\nOr just buy a fast zoom and be really crazy. I keep trying to convince myself I should spend big bucks on a 24-70 1.8, but there's really no way to justify it. "

"I've used Flickr since I started my first 365 project back in '09.\n\nEach year I create a new photo set and post my daily photo there to keep things organized.\n\nIf you need motivation or inspiration, a couple of friends started an iPhone 365 group on Flickr: http://www.flickr.com/groups/iphone365/ – there are tips around apps, shooting, etc.\n"
"I think he'd be renting, and doesn't own both."
"Can't disagree more.\n\nYoung kids love animals, they have toys that look like them, watch films based on them, probably have a few at home. And no young child really knows the difference between a lion and a cute kitten - Not to the extent that when they saw one they wouldn't just love to chase it and interact with it anyway.\n\nAs for respecting \"animals\" - unless they interact with said animal (a deer or whatever) they probably have not been taught anything about it, and seeing one in the wild must be a pretty amazing thing to young eyes."
"Because the human eye is able to tell the true color of the scene and we don't readily see the orange of a street light in person as quick as we do in a photograph. Our brains do a port of \"processing\" of the visuals we see so that if it was a snowy street with street lights, you would see the snow and say it's white but in the photo, it would look orange. We get rid of the tint in our heads even though if you look for it, you can see it. "
"Well for some it is, like archival photographers. But for artists they can do as they want I guess. Colour accuracy is usually something people seek in monitors and films/sensors, it might be so they can have a consistent base to then modify later though."
"What this guy said.\n\nIn camera raw, I basically just slide around the color balance &amp; tint sliders around until I find the \"right\" color for the photo. Getting an accurate color representation is usually only essential for product and archival shots."
"I wanted to add also that if you added a slight color tint to your monitor, for example, if you used it for a week or so, you would have a hard time telling there was a tint anymore. Same concept."
"Good point, I've looked at buying and renting and to hire for 2 weeks is about £60 each whereas to buy they are both (strangely enough) £349. Second hand they start at about £170, I'll keep looking - as you say it makes more sense in the long term rather than to keep hiring."
"There is no equivalent.  Nikon is better than anything that junky company Canon has ever put out. \n\nReal answer:  You'd be happy with a Canon 60D or Nikon D7000.  Pick which one feels best/has better ergonomics for you.  "
"Yes. See pages 49-50 of [your manual](http://www.nikonusa.com/pdf/manuals/coolpix/P520RM_EN.pdf)."
"Thanks, renting both of them for 2 weeks comes in at about £120 and buying them second hand starts at a fair bit above that for each of them (see my reply to Xkey2) - I will keep looking though and will hopefully make a longer-term investment!"
"I've got the standard body lens, an 18-55mm job. It's ok but nothing special about it and pictures can feel a bit flat with it. Not that that should completely stop it getting some good photos with a little creative work!"
"What a horribly gimicky and unusable website."
"You sir are a low down dirty liar! Obviously Canon is superior in every manner! I demand satisfaction for this insult!"
"Well that's a hell of a biased opinion. I don't know if your first sentence is a joke or not..?"
"I agree with your assessment on the general landscape, and not using half stops because the manual controls are only in full stops makes sense, but, for example, many lenses sharpest aperture is actually 5.6. For example, the Canon 70-200 f2.8 ii. Not that the difference is that noticeable or important. \n\nA more relevant argument would be DOF. If you are shooting a portrait and you want the full face in focus but not the background f5.6 is often your aperture. It seems silly to dismiss it because 5.6 isn't a pretty number or some kit lenses have it written on the lens barrel. Being a middle child isn't bad or good, it just is what it is. There is nothing that separates f5.6 from f4 or f8 besides our arbitrary numbering system. Nature doesn't care. \n\n\n\n\nif you were given a 85mm f1.2, would you stop it down to 1.4? What about an f1.8?\n\n\nI understand this is a thread on self imposed limitations, so all that is fine, but I am still a but confused on some of your logic. It's like only using lenses whose focal lengths are prime numbers or only using cameras with names that start with a vowel. \n\nAnyways, cheers on a unique self imposed limitation. "
"I think it is, only because of the \"real answer\" at the bottom. "
"Awesome, I look forward to visiting your city! Yes, the camera is the same and the 10-20 struggles to create a 'personal feel' between the subject and audience.\n\nI'll take a look at the 35mm instead, I found a Nikon one for much less than the 50mm Sigma (which surprised me) so hopefully that should equal the balance a bit. Thanks for the personal reviews - there's nothing like someone who actually uses it rather than trying to base a choice on what some reviewers make of it in an afternoon and  few sample images.\n\nI've been told the sunsets are great (as are the storms) so if I get photos of either - hopefully one more than the other - I'll try to post them!\n\nP.S. Apparently you're a Tucsonan."
"It's a good point - I'm building up more full control over settings and never go 'below' Program settings as I generally don't have the time to go into Manual mode and perfect a shot, but that's another discussion!\n\nIt's certainly a good discipline to get into taking full control over a shot - my main work is in video so you're screwed if you get shutter speed wrong."
"LOL yes I'm joking.  "
"That was my original thinking and if I can, I will. Just wondering what people think of the two different lenses and if I can get more use out of one than the other."
"Ha!  Nikon is black.  Darth Vader wore all black.  Michael Jackson used to be black.  NIKON WINS!"
"Waiting for the Leica owners to chime in..."
"Lots of folks are beating you up, but I have to agree with the message they are trying to say - photos must evoke emotion, tell a story, and have good composition if you want to show that you have artistic talent.  It's not skill in using a good camera that matters, but what you perceive when you are behind the camera. 1 and 3 are your best, and the rest look like stock photography.  None make me say 'Cool!' Or 'I want to know what's going on here'.  I don't mean to be mean AT ALL, but if you want constructive criticism, don't choose the photos you think are awesome and no one else really thinks a lot of, choose your most emotional images. I hope this helps.  The best photographs - weddings, events, and major news, shows raw emotion, gritty realism, or incredible visuals that sweep you off your feet."
"A 24-70 with 1.8 would be lovely, having such choice over framing but being able to get all that light in. I think longer term I'd get more use out of a fixed lens with f1.8 than the ultra wide option but having both would be sweet!"
"Looking at the specs for the 60D, it seems comparable to the D7000. I personally shoot a D7100, which is a great camera. One advantage to the D7000 line is the addition of a screw drive AF motor to the body, allowing you to use any AF lens with full functionality. The D7000 line also has an aperture feeler, which lets you use any AI or newer lens, which I believe means anything from 1977 onward, or even older is AI converted. If you can use your T3 glass on the 60D, stick with canon. If not, try out both cameras for a little and see which you like the feel of better. I think you can get converters to let you use your glass on M43 cameras, so it isn't a complete loss if you want to pick up a less expensive mirrorless too. \n\nEdit: formatting \n\nEdit 2: I meant to add this to my original post, the D3000, D5000 and other lines may have an aperture feeler too, but I'm honestly not sure. "
"If only you shot Canon I would be able to lend you my glass! I'm a photographer here in Tucson. What venue is the wedding at?"
"I'll take both if possible but I was just interested in what other photographers thought of the two lenses and which one I could get more use out of or conversely, which one I would lose out on the least by not taking it if I could only rent/buy one. I don't have a huge amount of cash to spend on glass but want to take something beside a fairly standard lens."
"That's racist"
"Ha, you plebe, black is a stupid colour, obviously black is better than black! Canon is black, licorice is black, the SR-71 is black, and Michael Jackson was black! Canon Wins!"
"White balance is color balance easy mode, unfortunately a white balanced photo is not always color balanced. Hooray color theory"
"It's cool, in a unique sense.\n\nI found it somewhat clumsy though.  I would rather have been able to be a little less hands on, and have all the content in a given section play through.  Unless I missed something, it seemed like a lot of button presses.\n\nI do love the visual of it all though."
"True, however Canon likes to use white on their pro lenses.  That's like most women putting on a white dress.  They want to \"seem\" pure, but we all know they were a whore!  Nikon doesn't pretend.  Nikon is a dirty whore and it wears it loud and proud.\n\nPoint:  Nikon"
"Wow thanks for the offer but yes, I'm yellow, not red! I don't know yet - out doors presumably which is a bit of a change for me as I was at a wedding a couple of weeks ago in the rain, though thankfully indoors. Any particular places to make sure I get to whilst I'm over there?"
"\"D700 line\" might be a little confusing given that there is a Nikon D700 with a different class of sensor."
"No the D7000 was in between D90 and the D300s. The D300s was released in the same year as the Canon 7D, and it's the highest end of crop camera nikon cameras. The D300s at the time featured a way better autofocusing system than the D7000 released a year later. The D300s also has a larger buffer and a faster burst rate, and you can use CF cards and SD cards. The built quality of the D300s is also superior to the D7000.\n\nBut it's true now that the D7100 is outperforming the outdated the D300s, and the D7000 also featured a better sensor. It's a shame that Nikon stopped developing the Dxxx line, they focused more on the lower end cameras and the pro full frame cameras."
"I set it to Auto and hand it over, and on my 6D, auto mode on the mode dial makes everything else automatic. No need to worry about focus there. Besides, the picture is for my memories, not a gallery, so it's not that important."
"Be cautious of jumping into video before you learn proper composition in still. Learn the rule of thirds and manipulating light and shadow exposure extremes. Read everything you can on topics like Fill in flash, and portrait composition. Then put your own touch to it. Video will be a whole different experience and your exposures will be superior to just shooting action. Challenge yourself to convey action in a still, a little shutter blur or implied movement. It will separate your video from the masses and in the end you want it to be distinguished.\n  "
"Your tips about switching from matrix to centre/point metering and upping the exposure comp helped a lot with the shots in the trees (although i didn't get any shots that were particularly interesting)\n\nFor each new shot i was taking i'd take a few, up the EV a step, take some more, up it again, step it back down, adjust the aperture etc.\n\nLearning lightroom and im liking it so far. I found the lens profile settings where it automatically applies corrections for that specific lens and that made a big difference too.\n\nThanks for your help and advice :)"
"Thanks for pointing that out. I had typed an asterisk after the 7 since I was referring to the D7000 or 7100, but it looks like that italicizes the text. "
"I don't think the k5 has a sync port. I know my k30 does not. The 560 ii I have will fire through the cable when attached to a wireless transmitter. But as said before that's for a shutter release not to sync a flash. \n\nI got an adapter that drops into the hotshoe for a Minolta flash that has a pc sync port (didn't actually let the flash fire) that I use just for the port when I use my sunpak 555.

"This is significantly less depressing than the [2013 NY Times year in pictures](http://www.nytimes.com/projects/2013/year-in-pictures/)"
"Sorry, I might not have explained that properly - I work in video already, using photographic composition etc and have my camera set up to work with that - matching shutter speed to frame rate etc. Photography I do appreciate is very different so I'm gradually getting more competent at taking time to perfect settings for a photograph rather than working quickly on a shot - there's generally a lot more lee-way for exposure/focus/blur in motion than still, which is why I'm working hard on getting my photography better."
"I did go take some quick sample shots but I have to get the film developed this weekend before we can see. \n\nSample shots were both taken at 1/60 28mm f2.8 and flashes set at 1/64 power. The exposure on the k30 came out just how I wanted it I will post pics if the film and digital side by side this weekend."
"&gt; Is full power on both flashes going to put out that same amount of light?\n\nNo. That Yong Nuo has a guide number of 190 feet at ISO 100. That Sunpak has a guide number of 150 feet at ISO 100. Guide number = f-number multiplied by distance. So the flash 10 feet away at full power will expose a gray card at f/19 on the Yong Nuo and f/15 on the Sunpak."

Yale or stanford or Brown or Princeton, etc, may look at it.  But, one last time:\n\n**Of the six top ranking schools I have applied to, six do not care about an arts portfolio accompanying academic and character materials.**  Even UR, which has ties with Eastman, the nation's *best* music school doesn't care about a music portfolio.  If you're admitted to UR you can take lessons for free at Eastman, at which point Eastman may look at a portfolio or audition, but in the application process it doesn't matter.  \n\nAlthough I guess it isn't dartmouth or harvard you're applying to, since the deadline has passed for them."

"If you say so. I don't shoot Nikon, so I wasn't in any position to judge. "
"I had an old Nikon Coolpix 5700 that I had converted about 5 years ago. Cost me about $150 at that time. The camera was one I had laying around. It was only 5MP, but it had some advantages over converting a DSLR. Forst of all, it was not an interchangeable lens camera. When you get a DSLR converted, you have to include a lens so that they can set the focus. IR focuses a bit differently from visable light. The camera is then tuned to that particular lens. In many cases, you will not notice the difference when using another lens, but sometimes this is a factor. Since the coolpix was not an interchangeable lens, the tuning they do works well. Google the older coolpix. They made other models than this one, and you can often get them used fairly cheap. Sony and canon also made models similar to this one, and some of them rate quite highly. Before you pay for it, though, make sure you can still get it converted. I have a real old minolta A-200. No one will touch it, but it would make a great IR if I could find someone who would. Many of the newer models of this class no longer take RAW, I find.  "
"If you used a really good tripod with a really good ball head, you'd know why. \n\nCheap legs wobble and shake. Cheap legs are generally heavier and/or hard to work with. \n\nCheap heads are a nightmare. Nothing more frustrating than locking the camera in place, letting it go, and the camera moves away from your locked position. A great ball head lets you set it quickly, and it doesn't move. \n\nYou just get what you pay for. "

"All very true. Also I used to have a cheap tripod, then when I upgraded my camera and lens, the tripod wasn't able to hold the weight of everything, so if I was using my telephoto for a shot, it would often times come out blurry because the camera and lens outweighed my whole tripod."

"Acceptable to whom? When you shoot a photo, you can color balance it as you see fit. Why do you feel the need to second guess the color balance other photographers use?\n\nThat the light was orange, so the photo should be orange is just one interpretation.

"by camera you probably mean something light, like a point and shoot to maybe an entry level dslr. some can do the job, especially if you just shoot landscape-style. but try that with a heavier, camera/lens then you'll notice tilts don't hold. i've personally encountered this when i tried using a 4x5 on a bogen head/stand combo (can't recall the model, sorry). it's fine with holding my dslr but i could hardly use it on the other. \n\nalso, if adjustment speed, panning, accuracy, etc. are factors, the $30 tripod may not offer those features as well.

"I did exaggerate a bit, but still, I prefer to keep low iso as often as possible. With everyone taking pictures with their phones and tablets these days, there's always so much noise in their photos, and one of the main reasons I love photography is because I get to take sharp photos at a low iso because phones and other lower end cameras can't. I really hate noise, so if i'm somewhere at night and see something interesting, ya i'll take the picture at the highest iso if i need to, but chances are i'll probably never show the picture to anyone.\n\nEDIT** also, the example you gave at iso3200 was taken at iso100 with a shutter of 1/3200 according to the exif "

"These aren't mine.  I use a D90, which is actually slightly behind the 60D, but I have no issues using ISO 1600 and 3200.  I think my camera does high ISO NR, but I also edit it in Light Room to apply some slight NR.  \n\nI'd say hit youtube and search for \"Noise Reduction using (your editing program of choice).\"  You can't work miracles, but a 60D can def do 3200 and higher.  "
"All my cameras, D90, D7000, and my D800 were all refurbs.  The only issue i had was with my D800.  It would  not focus at all (nothing to do with the left focus issue.)

It would be useful as a simple \"absolute\" comparison number, but then:\n* Different manufacturers must *not* be calculating the numbers the same way, because, for example, my Canon 580EX IIs are substantially more powerful than my YongNuo 560EXs, even though *both* advertize a guide number of 58.\n\nExpanding on that... Guide numbers (the idea of effective distance) would theoretically only be meaningful in the case of \"direct\" (bare) flash and lose their meaning when using light modifiers. You would think that *watts per second* might be a better metric, but even there it's not much better—numbers mean something different from one brand to the other.\n\nUnfortunately, you have to try to know where a given flash stands..."

They were all touched up a bit and cropped in lightroom. \n\nSettings are a little all over the place for LR, but it was generally:\n\nPull highlights down, pull shadows, whites, and blacks up or down depending on the image\n\nSettings that are the same for all: Clarity at +30, Vibrance +30, and Saturation +10. Adjust your sharpening and NR as you see fit."

"It's not really useful.  On a nikon, it won't ramp the live preview up anyway and the rear display will be unusably bad because of noise.\n\nOn a canon, live view focusing is done on stars which show up fine in the 3200 area anyway.  \n\nYou wouldn't do AP at ISO 400 anyway, it's below unity gain.

"i had both versions of the 50 1.8 at one point (bought one for cheap and one came as a bundle) and sold both immediately. why? the sound it makes when it focuses!! i hardly tested it because every time i used it the sound just distracts me/turned me off. \n\nif you can tolerate it that's fine. i'd test both if possible. there's nothing worse than getting the cheaper one, then realizing you want the better one and end up spending more in the process.

For $150, they're extremely sturdy. Some find them too heavy, but personally the weight is just fine for me. I haven't taken it on any long hikes, but I wouldn't mind traveling with it.

"OM-1n: $112.50\n50mm f/1.4: $17.50\nScreens:\n1-1: $4\n1-2: $12\n1-3: $15\n1-13: $16\n\nI'll include any one of the screens for free, and since you're not getting a tele, I would suggest the 1-13 and, if you want an MP matte, the 1-1.  You really don't need more than the 1-13 and the 1-1 for the sort of shooting you would do with the 50mm f/1.4.  I ended up using the 1-1, or 1-2, for general shooting depending on the lens.  The longer ones used the 1-2.  The 1-3 usually sat in the case.\n\nSo, for a nice kit which would allow you to use the 50mm, you're looking at $130 with the 1-13 plus any extra focusing screens and shipping.  I wouldn't bother buying any except the 1-1 screen if I were you.\n\nThe film tag holder just fell off the back of the OM-1n, but it can be glued back on pretty easily.  It looks like the light seals could use a replacement.  It's been stored without a battery, so the battery compartment is clean.  I'll include a skylight filter with the 50mm if I can dig one out.

"If you're a good salesmen, you can read people a little better and can determine what they are willing to pay. Likely, getting them to pay more/to your advantage. If you're a pushover/bad salesmen, this can hurt you as listing no prices gives more room for haggling that wouldn't benefit you.   \n  \nif you're a bad salesmen, you can default to 'well these are the prices' and everyone has a level playing field and people know up front what they are in for.   \n  \nListing no prices gives a good salesmen the opportunity to sell something to someone who might not have been willing to buy it, had you listed the prices. For example, if a print is $100, someone might see that price listed and think \"No way too high!!\" and not even inquire. If your'e a good salesmen and don't list prices, you might be able to sell it to that same guy for $120. "

I push the D7000 a lot :P\n\nThe D7000 and D7100 have different feels to them when you hold them. Neither is better, just different. They're both extremely alike though. I've used the D7000 a few times as a secondary body, and it's practically handles the exact same as the D7100. IMO the D7000 feels denser. They both have excellent build quality, and while the D7100 has excellent, if not the best, crop sensor IQ, the D7000 isn't too far behind. They're both definitely passable, the D7100 more so. I wouldn't hesitate taking my D7100 to ISO 6400 if the situation called for it.\n\nAs long as you're not using slow lenses and you know how your AF system works and how to get the best out of it (point at high contrast subjects, set the proper AF area mode, etc.) the AF on the D7100 is fast and accurate, even in the dark. I'm not sure about the D7000, since I haven't put it through any demanding conditions, but the D7100 performs extremely well. It shares an AF system with the D4, whereas the D7000 uses an older 39-point system, but I don't know if there's a significant difference.\n\nI would rather have a used/refurbed D7000 and money for lenses over a D7100, but mine was a gift, so I'm not complaining :P"

A *world* of difference.\n\nIt's not just that it's much sturdier, but it's so much *nicer* to use! This needs to be repeated: If using your tripod/head is a pain in the arse, you won't use it.

When the sun starts to go down around 4 it really makes 6PM assignments hard.\n\nAlso when you print those noisy images on news print and place them next to ISO 100 shots, most of the time you can not see any noise difference just because printing on newsprint is that bad.

"Based on your responses, I would NOT upgrade your body yet. Go out and shoot A LOT. Learn to use the camera and through that process, you'll learn where the camera and/or lenses are limiting the results you can get. 9 times out of 10, you'll get limited first by your lens. You will probably want a wider angle lens for landscape, interior shots, etc so you might want to pick up something in the 12-35 range. Maybe you need a tele (long range) lens that's a bit faster than the 75-300 (this lens is notoriously garbage at the long end,) so you'll want to upgrade to a better tele zoom. Or maybe you want to pick up a 85 prime for nice portraits.\n\nBut until you know WHY you need to upgrade, don't spend the money. I couldn't imagine how mad I'd be upgrading my camera body or lens just because, then realizing in the next couple of months that I really needed something else for my style of shooting and I wasted the money.\n\nI really really suggest you shoot as much as you can, then come back when you realize the actual limits of your gear and ask again, but with specific reasons as to why you want to upgrade (need to take quick action in low light, need to shoot sports with long focal ranges, need a super fast lens for portraits and that beautiful BOKEH!, etc.)\n\nA t3 with your 50 1.8 can produce beautiful images. Don't try to keep up with others on gear, just for the sake of gear... that's a slippery slope, there is ALWAYS someone with more expensive gear.

It's supposed to be the best camera since spam-in-a-can.  \n\nWhat a giant piece of shit in those conditions. Focusing? HA! Nope. Not a chance. Couldn't get focus most of the time. I tried every setting from full auto, to full manual and every flash and focus setting in between.   \n  \nHanding it to someone to take a photo? They looked at me as if it were alien and even in full auto with multiple-point focus, I got maybe 1 snapshot.   http://imgur.com/a/P89JK\n  \nYou know how had much better photos? Everyone with a damn iPhone/Android cell phone and 1 friend with an rx100 that performed amazing. I'm really really upset I didn't bring my rx100. He said he didn't miss focus on a single photo and the battery lasted all night. \n \nI don't care what the Fuji fanboys say, the x100 is not a great camera and certainly not a carry-around camera to take photos of friends on a night out.    \n  \nMy rx100 would have been absolutely PERFECT for this night...instead, I spent half the night pissed off at it trying to 'make it work'.     \n \nTo answer your question, I just switch it to Aperture priority, f8, multi-point focus when I hand over my camera. Most of the time, it works out great. It's quick enough to do and I don't expect them to take an amazing photo so I'm not worried about getting that perfect shot with sharp eyes at f.1.8. \n  \n"
"Lumens would be a great metric, but the same *kind* of problems persist:\n\n* Raw output can be the same, but dispersed differently you won't get the same result. Who decides of the methodology to measure—especially with different designs and capabilities? Obviously if the head of the flash can \"zoom\" and have a longer throw it'll read as more powerful than another one...\n* Numbers given by manufacturers would still have to be taken with a grain of salt as we know the claims rarely match the reality."
"Well, to be fair, your basis for comparison is the 60D. It's no slouch for ISO performance but you are using results from that camera and comparing to cameras who have both a larger sensor and newer technology. The ISO performance of those cameras are just better.\n\nBut also, the cameras that have ISO's that go that high generally only natively support a max ISO that is lower than 204,800. But then it is expandable to an ISO that high. You have to activate it if you want it. And if you want to activate it, you generally have a reason to and the manufacturers that build that ISO expandability into the camera understand that some photographers want that capability in their equipment.\n\nWhy would a photographer want to go that high? Perhaps they want to stop action in their shot in extremely low light and feel that it warrants the extra noise. Perhaps they have other creative reasons to do so. The point is, it's there and because you won't use that feature does not mean that it is not useful to someone else. It's like asking why they make cameras with GPS. A lot of people won't use it, but those that do appreciate it."

"B&amp;H is the only place I ever buy from because of reasons like this. Also their customer service is the best. I had a broken tascam dr-60d on assignment in NYC and exchanged it for a new one even though i was past the 30 day return policy (by 4 days) and only had the unit itself. The guy at the counter exchanged it with no problems at all."
"Nice normal lens for a crop sensor DSLR. It'll have the same focal length as the 50mm primes sold with manual focus film SLRs once upon a time."
"Those are still made by adobe. They don't respect the in-camera settings (contrast, saturation, etc)"
"&gt; additional skillset that includes precise control of white balance\n\nAre you really describing a skillset or a feature on a camera?"
"FOr clarity, OP, /u/p_rex means same *field of view.*  Focal length doesn't change mounting it on a different format."
"why very basic editing? i understand you might not want things very heavily edited but things like hdr are very common techniques to use seems like you might be excluding some great images just because some people are shit at editing \n\nalso in the book the photographers should be given credit for their images "
"Awesome!:) Just set up an account to start"
"Thanks! "

"I still see everything under sodium vapour lights as tinted orange.\n\n"
"I like mine very much. In my opinion 50mm is a bit too tight, especially for indoor shooting. That's why I prefer 35mm. "
"Nepal. Ive been working on funding for a book id like to make about culture, religion, food and how they are all connected in Nepalese culture. "
"FYI: Those shots aren't 'no noise reduction applied', colour noise reduction has been applied to them."
"But its bad sportsmanship to shoot geese while they're just standing in a field. "
"A gold paint sharpie with a thin tip!"
"Having seen some pixels in my time, I'd say it's a form of art called \"shopped\"."
