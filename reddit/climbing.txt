"Hey there! I'm the drone owner, it was on sale for $869 at Hobbytown USA. This package included the DJI Phantom 2 Drone and H3-2D Zenmuse Gimbal. The GoPro I've had for awhile."
"I'm from....Florida. It's a bit of a drive. Guy in the pic is one of my friends a few climbing trips ago. It's the closest place I have found for sport climbing."
"Yes sir! Feel like a total dork wearing a GoPro, but it's all good fun and I got some great footage (EDIT: I have it on YT if anyone would like to watch me fumble some draws).\n\nWe did a 3 day trip. Day 1 at Medlow Bath on Grey Slab working \"Mainly Fine (17)\" which is an interestingly technical and intimidating 17. \n\nDay 2 and 3 was spent at Bardens Lookout where I lead and set up top-ropes for friends. Arrow and the Song (15). Karinya (16), where the photo was taken. Monkey Girl (17), new route which is not in the book. End of of the cave to the left of Arrow and the Song. Average wall height 25 meters. I'm from Sutherland so our local crags are all between 8-12 meters - so a good pump was had on a 'longer' route. \n\nCan't wait to get back out to the Mountains and work on some harder stuff. \n\nP.s - Hi Tundra."
"Don't worry, we got it. "
"winter linkup of the ten highest peaks in Montana,\nGhirardelli on Mt. Prindle in AK, \nHam and Eggs on the Moose's Tooth"
"Ah, too bad! I'm quite close to the area."
"Awesome, can't wait to start the climbing season. We might be moving from North Van to Squamish, 2014 is looking good! "
"Yes, a lot has been cleared and cleaned and opened and named. Some members of the local ICA spent a lot of time in preparation for the \"Protect What's Holy\" competition. Get a hold of the ICA and see if you can get a copy of the map they handed out at the competition. If not, keep me in mind and maybe I can scan my copy."
"they are fine then"
"Unless you're super-strong, a week is probably too much (especially as there's no nearby camping. But you could easily make a week's visit to hit the So Ill quality areas."
"Hmm don't think it's Phil, but maybe Brad.  I'll check that out, thanks!\n\n"
"I really wanted to make it to that, but sadly, I had a conflict.  I spent most of the fall season at Jackson and the Red, but I'm hoping to put some serious time in the Holies this winter.\n\nI'm hoping to make it out there (I'm in Champaign Urbana) this weekend.  If you could hook me up with the map, that would be awesome. If you're in Carbondale, Marion, or another nearby town, I'd love to buy you a beer after I'm done climbing. :D\n\nI know the general layout of the area (locations Mollusk, Tyler Durden, Seafoam Arette, and an area with a ton of hard stuff to the left), but I'm hoping to get on a lot of v2/v3 with maybe a few v4 problems and most of the stuff I know was a good bit harder.  Both times I made it down there, I ran into Eric, who helped me find some easier (but still pretty hard for me) stuff.\n"
"The official mr. safety internet answer:\n\n* check with your manufacturer. they usually suggest a shelf life of x years, and that's.. ya know sitting in the plastic on the shelf. actual use is a bit rougher.\n* look for signs of wear (http://www.petzl.com/us/ppe-checking)\n\nthen make your decision. harnesses aren't that expensive, but they're also super bomber made. \n\n"
"Looks cold up there!"
"Well shit. I've been stretching before exercise since I was born. That may explain why all my joints are getting fucked up now. Especially my fingers, shoulders, and elbows."
"On a glacier if you break through a snow bridge or slip and fall into a crevasse you rely totally on your partner to arrest your fall. There are some absolutely MASSIVE cracks on ranier and you wouldn't be able to get out of them by yourself if you were alone.  "
"Well even more impressive that they got anything clean, I mean it's a little all over the place but probably 100x better than I could do with the same equipment."
"I'm guessing you'd be too injured or the ice too unstable to use axes to climb out?  "
"The guy can't spell Petzl, has safety harnesses and a figure eight? Sounds like it's probably stolen gear. Steer clear."
"If you've spent time at Jax the last few years, then undoubtedly you've seen me. I practically live there from late-October to late-December. \n\nNot from Illinois, but when I go to the Holies, I usually try to stop at Quatro's on the way home. (I'll scan the map when I get some time (at work right now)).\n\nI know the layout, but they cleaned a lot of routes. I climbed boulders I hadn't seen before."
"nylon breaks down in moisture. moisture content in the air alone is enough to compromise the integrity of nylon fibers after time.  \nthis information comes direct from my old man, who runs one of the largest thermoplastic manufacturing companies.  \nhe has advised me in the past to replace nylon gear every 5-years.  \nis this being overly cautious? most certainly it is... but $50-100 on a new harness is cheaper than spinal surgery.  \nunfortunately there's no black and white answer here. if you live in a desert climate you're probably okay if they were stored inside, if you're in a humid area then i'd be more weary.  \nit all depends on whether or not you want to become the case-study argument if they fail.  \npersonally, i'd probably test them with a bit of a load in a control study. see if you notice any unwarranted stressing anywhere. but keep in mind that such equipment is generally over-engineered in the interest of safety... so if it fails it'll probably be an unexpected and catastrophic failure (which is pretty consistent in the failure patterns of climbing equipment).  \n**like captain Ron says: \"if anything's gonna happen it's gonna happen out there\"**  \n  \nedit: bonus! here is very short PDF from PerkinElmer which discuesses the properties of Nylon-6 when it gets wet: http://www.perkinelmer.com/CMSResources/Images/44-74182APP_InfluenceofWaterOnMechPropsandTG.pdf  \n  \nedit2: here's a rather indepth analysis of the absorption properties of different nylons: http://www.sdplastics.com/nylon.html  \n  \n**edit3: this has got my wheels spinning, so i just now posted some questions to several gear manufactures who make harnesses... i'm going to get some specific information on the exact types on nylon used. i'll then do some more quantifiable calculations on what the exact deterioration rates will be in various environments. i'll consider composing some charts/graphs showcasing my findings... otherwise i'll include this in the information system i am building for alpinists and long-distance trekkers.**"

"There is a lot like that. You can camp near the table rock picnic area along Jonas ridge. Hikes to hawksbill, right there at table rock, short hikes to the nc wall, amphitheatre, long hike to shortoff. Plus it's scenic and airy. Just be careful with your fire. \nDon't neglect the west rim either, accessed by old 105, it is more adventurous and you are more likely\n to find solitude. "
"You'd probably be really jacked up. I certainly [couldn't climb out of this...](http://images.summitpost.org/original/879396.JPG)"
"I was just in Red Rock from the 26th-28th.  The weather couldn't have been better.  A light jacket in the shade was all you needed and there wasn't a bit of wind.\n\nI was doing sport routes but I have heard great things about Tunnel Vision (5.7 trad).  Of course, if you have time, Epinephrine is a 5.9, 12 pitch classic.\n\nBecause of the great weather and winter break, the crowds are large.  "

"Yeah, that's why I didn't write it. He's been posting Holy photos on FB. Makes me jealous. I might try to get over this weekend, even though I'd rather rope. "
"Rope climbing in January? Jesus, you're a tough man. If you do decide to head out to Holies next weekend shoot me a PM I think my roommate and myself are going out. Gonna try and get some serious work done on Shadow of a Man.  "
"I believe the man you spoke to may have been Grahm Doe.  As far as I knew the only one bolting out there lately has been a climber named Rances, but I believe Grahm did a large portion of the bolting at the secret crag you speak of.  It appears Grahm wrote this new book to Shuteye Ridge.  I have never been there but have heard it is stellar.  Sport, trad, mixed, multi-pitch, etc.   \n\nhttp://wolverinepublishing.com/shuteye-ridge\n\nHere is a video of Tommy Caldwell doing the FA of a new hard route in the area.  Cheers.   \n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoFZcWpg1ZI"
"Bouldering kills my shoulders. But I'll still do it. If I can find someone, yeah, I'd rather rope at Cedar or find some sunny routes at Jax. But if I hit Holy, it'll probably be Saturday, and I'll send message if I go or not."
"My wife and I went out there last year. Some fun lead routes and a nice hike in. We were a little nervous in some spots about how chossy the topouts were and risk for rockfall. Anyone have any experience with this? Also, the melted rock where the dynamite blast heated the rock on the left wall as you face the entrance to the quarry is pretty crazy to climb on, really cool experience. "

"My original answer was:\n&gt;Personally I'm hoping for a gift card to get some new climbing shoes and I'd like a Black Diamond Gridlock carabiner. It would be cool to get some more holds for my bouldering wall project but unfortunately that's on hold (no pun intended) for a little while.\nEdit: I'm also hoping for the Reel Rock 7 and/or 8 DVD/Blurays.\n\n/u/lionheartednyhc was super generous and mailed me his barely used magnetron gridlock carabiner.\n\nMy in-laws hooked it up with a copy of Freedom of The Hills.\n\nMy wife gave me a copy of and High Crimes: The Fate of Everest in an Age of Greed by Michael Kodas.\n\nAnd my parents got me a pair of La Sportiva Katana Laces which I couldn't be more stoked about since I had worn through the soles on my Tarantulas and nearly through the leather."
"Cool to see some other peak climbers on here! I was working that night. Hope you heal fast! I'd try to do some core training mainly, always a good thing to have a strong core."
"When in doubt, just buy a new one"
"&gt; I'm buying my first harness this week as an early gift for myself; the Corax which I have been eyeing is on sale for $49 at Sport Chalet and I might be able to get a 25% discount.\n\nI didn't buy it then, the sale ended. but then I checked again on Cyber Monday and it went down to $30, so I got it.

"hey ive got the full picture of this as my wallpaper! "
"not fake. deep water soloing off of Tonsai, Thailand. I believe thats Ao Nang Tower and Tonsai in the distance "
"I am a photographer and the lighting on the subject is near impossible in those settings.  I could be wrong but this a sure image of the subject in a studio layer masked over your \"deep water soloing off of Tonsai, Thailand."
"Howso? The sun is on the camera's left side on the rock, and on the climber. Nothing about the lighting looks odd to me."
"You see that drastic shadow behind his left knee?  That was created with a flash.  Where exactly was that flash  in this photo?\n"
"Interesting, what do you think of left foot placement? Looks like it's heel hooked to thin air.\n\n*edit: sigh, it was meant as a sarcastic joke, one that's not well received apparently* :("
"See i understand that but i would argue that this bad practice might be imitated outside the gym. You know?"
"I worry that people might imitate the setup at home. "
"Clay Frisbie gets my vote! As for the rest of the state, hope you can find Cole Fennel's book, which is out of print."
"You've never seen the sun do that? You may want to get out more. There is seriously nothing fishy about this photo."
"Mountain Project says a lot of the climbing is Trad, but we only have equipment for sport or top rope.  Can a lot of the Trad routes accessible from the top to make top ropes?"
"It's not a heel hook, he's go his foot pushing off. "
"Oh for sure it's might lead to bad habits, but I also think most gym climbers don't end up climbing outdoors anyways.\n\nI would rather not have to anchor in to a daisy chain but it's not a big deal. "
"Between friends and family I got: Sportiva Miuras, pack of 6 'biners, PAS 22, Petzl headlamp, Adirondack Rock guidebook. "
"You're not a very good photographer. Compare the shadow on his body to the rock. This is obviously shot on a clear day, no clouds in the sky. If it were overcast, then there would be no harsh shadows. In this case though, the shadows are consistent throughout the photo. Its one of the most basic aspects of photography outdoors. "
"Velcro. Stupidly comfy climbing shoe that takes 2 seconds to slap on or off. I may have the miuras now as a more \"performance\" shoe, but the tarantulas are keeping a spot in my gear bag."

Been to Cathedral once when I just started out and was super intimidated by the high first bolts. \n\nPossibly heading Alfords Pt or Illawong tomorrow before Mountains as there's a few higher sport climbs there.\n\nDid all the moves on Kim (21) at Bonnet Bay today! Had an cracker of a fall from the top but got back on it and finished the sequence two attempts later!\n\nWhat area you from Barry? \n\nEDIT: You wouldnt happen to be able to give me some solid advice on using bolt-plates with skinny biners?

"I'm that case you will want to stick close to table rock. It has a few sport routes some Multipitch. Also just a short hike down the ridge you will come to an area known as the chimneys with access to anchors (natural and bolted) at the top.

"True, metal gear generally isn't too expensive though so I'd rather just get new. I fully admit I'm probably being over cautious but I'd rather be like that then not careful enough."
"It is the cars parked along the side of the road. The parking lot is really small."
"Full sunlight. All shadows match the angle and shadow edge hardness.  Looks pretty good to me"

"Happy New Year everyone!\n\nI want to get my head sorted. This is by far my biggest problem, has always been. If I weren't so afraid of falling (while bouldering, not when climbing), injury and not measuring up, I would easily climb higher grades than I do now (my technique is pretty solid, because I want as much control as I can have... :/ ). But more importantly: I would enjoy climbing more. It's my biggest passion, yet so much of it is tinged with negative emotions...\n\nOther than that: get fit and strong again, possibly stronger than I was. Cut back on the sweets, cakes, etc. Do a serious training cycle.\n\n(I've read all the staples, btw. I'm still not over the fear, unfortunately.) "
