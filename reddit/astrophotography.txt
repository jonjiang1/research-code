"For the incredibly bored, I'll be \"test streaming\" RGB capture on NGC 2264 tonight, and am in the chat to answer any Qs if necessary. :)"
"Really? I would've thought the way Dobs are built, big as they are, that weight wouldn't be too much trouble? I could be way wrong."
"No, in fact there's a lot more \"cord routing\" to pay attention to with a GEM because of the flip. My cords just come down off the camera with plenty of slack for the range of motion. They just go along the ground over to the laptop table."

"I finished capturing these images just before midnight and just processed them now.  \n  \nThe Horsehead nebula has always been my favorite object in our night sky, but this is the first time I've ever caught a photo of it, and to me this image means a hell of a lot because of that.   \n\n22 min total exposure (would have been more but had more problems). 11 x 120s at 800ISO.

"Beautiful! I'm downloading the tiff now!"
"Congratulations! ... and many more."
"look forward to it :-)"
"Yeah it will be top heavy. I've seen people use magnetic weights to help.\n\nAlso remember that you have no tracking so you're really limited on exposure time.\n\nI'd recommend using a webcam instead of the DSLR."
"Big dob owner here: It can cause the tube to fall down, depending on the angle and what else you have attached. Though with a non-tracking dob I don't see why that's a huge issue. "

"1) Go with the XSi. It's the best AP camera Cannon has ever (accidentally) designed.\n\n2) You'll need the telescopes.com t-adapter, plus [something like this one from Orion](http://www.telescope.com/Astrophotography/Camera-Adapters-T-Rings/Orion-2-Zero-Profile-Prime-Focus-Camera-Adapter/pc/-1/c/4/sc/62/p/102119.uts). One adapts the camera, the other adapts the telescope to adapt to the adapter of the camera.\n\n3) Everyone else is right about the weight thing. Unless you can add tension to the mount to keep it from slipping (I can on my SkyWatcher hybrid truss dob . . .), you'll need to figure out how to add counterweights to the opposite side of the OTA to balance stuff out so the tube doesn't start to sag down.\n\n4) You're not going to be shooting galaxies and nebulae. Understand that now. You'll get pretty awesome shots of the Moon and, if you own a 2x or 3x barlow, you'll get pretty good single shots of the larger planets. Down the road, consider investing in a planetary camera like the Celestron NexImage 5 to get even better shots of the moon and planets."

"ok great thanks.  I know I got the right scope because when I bought it I only had personal viewing in mind, now all my friends are begging me to let them hook their cameras up to it!  I think if I had intended for astrophoto I would have gone with something smaller with tracking.  thanks for the advice"
"tell me about it. that's what i did to the AT6RC, but it was because i was trying to learn how not to mess up my AT10RC. in the end i had to buy a glatter collimator laser and ring holograph and i managed to put the AT6RC back in collimation. took me forever though.\n"
"thanks, yeah in the end it was easy... i had to normalize the frame brightnesses by hand (using staralignment's frame adaptation to get the equations) but otherwise it worked really smoothly."

"Thanks :)"
"Yeah... I have a Glatter collimator, too, but with the grid rather than the ring holograph.  I should probably just spring for the ring holograph, since that seems to be what I really need."
"As far as I'm aware, the \"Nifty Fifty\" is a fast (f/1.8) 50mm lens from Canon, which sells for somewhere around $125.  They also sell a faster (f/1.4) 50mm lens for ~$350, but I don't believe that one's called the \"Nifty Fifty\".  In answer to OP's question, yes, it should be possible to take pictures of the stars with a nifty fifty lens on your camera."
"Oh yeah, a good tripod will let you shoot any lens and capture the stars. The Nifty-fifty takes in a lot of light which also helps. \n\nThe problem you'll find is that 50 mm is not a wide lens, this leaves you with just a tiny part of the sky in your image. \n\nI live in Sweden and Canon name their cameras differently here for some reason, but I believe that the T2i is a Crop sensor camera? This makes the section of the sky you will catch even smaller. \n\n\nI say try it out and see what you think of it. Do you also have the 18-55 kit lens? \n\nTrry it like this: \n\n* Put your camera on the tripod.\n* Set the camera to self timer - or use a remote for it. This is to avoid shaking the camera. \n* Shot the camera manually. \n* ISO 2000 or somewhere around that. \n* F-stop, use it as wide as possible. You want a LOT of light to be collected. \n* Shutter speed - this will differ on the lens. With the nifty-fifty you will need to keep it below 20 seconds or probably even under 15 seconds or the stars will trail in your photo. A wider lens like the 18-55 shot at 18 will give you more time and therefor more light. \n\nI would also recommend shooting in \"RAW\" format so you will be able to further boost and correct the image in post. \n\nOh, and have a look at your cameras on board noise reduction. I don't know anything about your camera but sometimes it is better to set it to Low of even turn it off and do the NR yourself in post. \n\nJust play around with it and you'll see what works best. \n\n\nFeel free to ask me if anything of this is unclear or you need other tips. :\n"

"Ah.  I hadn't heard of \"Thrifty Fifty\" as a term before, so I figured it was \"Nifty\" because it was both fast and inexpensive."

"Thanks to some inspiration from an old moon thread from someone using Registax for their moon photos on here, I decided to go back and revisit my old data.  What I learned is... Don't toss away old data all the time.  Once you learn better techniques for stacking and processing, you can revisit some of your old stuff and you might learn something!\n\n**Data**: I didn't really take a look at the exposure times (months old pics), but most of my moon photos have been 1/125 range at 200-400ISO.  This was approximately 8 or so of them stacked.  This was taken with my Canon T1i (baader modified, not that it matters with a moon photo, although you'll notice a bit of a red tinge since I didn't correct it much).  Scope used was my Astrotech 72mm doublet and a 2x barlow in this particular photo.\n\n**Old inspiration**: I wanted to take some old moon photos I had, and instead of scrapping them, revisiting the data.  This is somewhere around 8 moon photos that I recentered in photoshop and then stacked in Registax.  I dabbled to sharpen them up a bit.  The pic is a bit small, it was more of a, \"Let's see what I can do with smaller pics and old data\" than anything.  I plan on going out for some more lunar pics later in the week.\n\n**Old comparison/old data**: Here is a pic of [one of the old moon photos](http://imgur.com/vaqxu0S) **without** stacking or modification.  A bit more blurry, not as crisp, not as much detail.  \n\nIn the future I plan on revisiting Lunar photos soon.  I previously was wondering how everyone was getting such insanely crisp photos until I started seeing that those people were stacking them primarily.  It brought out a ton of surface detail I didn't even notice and allowed for a lot more data to be pulled out.  I'm so used to only doing it with deep sky objects, I didn't even bother with my moon photos on my new setup.  So now that I've found a few fun tricks in Registax (thank you reddit) I will hopefully share some more soon.  Although... I enjoy Deep Sky objects a bit more.\n\n"

"I tend to believe that focus will be a real pain with a 1.8 aperture."
"What kind of scope/camera?"
"I had an XT8 I used and took some solar photos with the same filter you're using (well, same film, different size).  One thing I had a ton of fun with was stacking them.  If you can get a barlow on there, you can get some nice close ups and focus them somewhat well.

"I actually got my CG5 for $459USD new.  Keep an eye out for \"old stock\" sales.  My CG-5GT was becoming \"obsolete\" and the place I bought it from wanted to get rid of them so they could sell the new models.  End of year sales are fantastic because it's \"out with the old in with the new\" - many people want the latest and greatest, but I have no problems with \"last year's stuff\" and my CG-5GT has been a fantastic mount for my little AT72mm scope.\n\nYou'll find that the more interested in this hobby you become, there are going to be things you want or even need to better your pictures, exposures.  A lot of it can come down to just learning to use your equipment better, your software better and your camera better.\n\nA few things I would mention:\n\n* If you find that you have windy evenings where you're at, a tripod with **heavy** legs will help a lot.  Lighter mounts will tend to shift and shake a little.  May not always make a giant difference, but I've noticed it.\n\n* Use a remote.  This also will help reduce any camera shake and also allow you to use the bulb setting for longer exposures which is great from the get go.  Perhaps you do this already, but just in case, there ya go.\n\n* Keep in mind if you have a go to mount, it is **not** necessary to do a star alignment every time.  This is really just used for the \"go to\" setting.  However, a good polar alignment **is** necessary.  I dont' bother with go to anymore, I just align it and use the remote to go where I want.  I would say a tracking mount is necessary, a go to is not.  If you can get one you can use with a remote, tracks and works well, you can probably save some money.  But many mounts anymore that do that have a goto function anyway since it's so popular (that goes back to the \"consider used equipment\").\n\nI would say for astrophotography your priority list in gear should be:\nmount, camera, telescope.  The reason I choose that order for personal preference is because without a mount to track, you're severely limited on exposures.  With a decent camera, you can still get great pics with a minimal scope, and learn a lot about exposure times and ISOs, stacking techniques and using your software.  Once you get bored with your setup, you can always step up the scope and camera later (usually with the same mount)."
"I suggest you file a bug report.  ;-)"
"&gt; You are supposed to ask AFTER you use them.\n\nAs some wise soul once said: it's always easier to beg forgiveness than ask permission ;)"
"I have been looking at the EQ5 with the dual axis motor from firstlightoptics, it seems reasonably priced (at ¬£310), but doesnt have the goto functionality... But as you said, that isnt necessary. At the moment, I have a Canon 450D with a 250mm lens, and once I get a scope for the mount, I can put my camera on that and use it for Imaging. The EQ5 is ¬£230 and the dual axis motor is ¬£90, (off the top of my head), This is all ill need to track the sky? I'm worried that without the skytrack and goto, the tracking will be innaccurate and sloppy... first time buying is always a pain in the neck, im sorry."
"I do not use any kind of guidescope.  I don't even have a finder scope.  I use my Canon and telescope to find objects and even to do my polar alignment.  Perhaps that makes me the odd duck around here, but I like it.\n\nAs long as the mount is capable of doing something like sidereal, solar and lunar for tracking rates, you should be gold.  You are of course, going to get fantastic results with something like a guidescope, but if you're going in on a budget for the first time, I'd stick with something that has at least sidereal tracking.\n\nThe only time I want the goto function is if I'm having a hard time determining where something is, then I'll bother doing a 2 star alignment and letting it do the goto.\n\nLiterally all I have to do anymore with my mount is set it up, make sure it's level, do a polar alignment, set it to sidereal tracking and point it where I want it once I'm done.\n\nAs a recent example: [Here's a pic I took of Orion](http://i.imgur.com/DaagpzA.jpg).  With an eyeballed polar alignment and 90 second exposures."
"where can i learn how to do these? "
"So I should be able to do this with the mount and dual axis motor that Ive seen online? Im not after 50 minute hubble standard images, so as long as its accurate for around 1-2 mins, I should be happy. I just dont want to shell out all this money, and then realise that I need something else ontop of the dual axis motor, or the dual axis motor is for something else all together"
"&gt; EQ5 \n\nIf you're talking [this mount here](http://www.orionoptics.co.uk/MOUNTS/eq5mounts.html) then yes, those will work just fine (except, the one in that link looks like it doesn't come with all the stuff, just the mount).  It's dual axis with a sidereal tracking rate.  RA and DEC axis are what you'd be after as long as it does sidereal tracking rates.  Most common tracking mounts today are RA and DEC axes with sidereal/solar/lunar for tracking rates.\n\nHere is a really [good article on mounts](http://www.astropix.com/HTML/I_ASTROP/MOUNTS.HTM) which might help you determine what might work best for what you're after.  But the CG-5GT and the EQ5 are german equatorials with RA/DEC axes with sidereal tracking.  Which is what most people go after unless you wanna spend mucho bucks on the extra guidescope and error correction."
"Can you be more specific with your question?  There's a host of information on the sidebar here with lots of info on getting started.  Not sure what you want to know, but there are quite a few folks here that are far more learned than I am, and we're all happy to help!"
"Well, it's a limitation of the lens, really.  Wide open on this lens at 300mm is f/5.6 and I typically stop it down at least once to combat some things like chromatic aberration and sharpness problems."
"Very good for a first time and exposure.  Looks to be well in focus.  Not sure what mount you're using, but if you're able to snag longer exposures on it and do some stacking, you'd be blown away at the detail you'll get.  Great first attempt!"
"I see your total exposure time was 5 minutes 46 seconds, how long were your exposures each?  Without a tracking mount you'll be limited on how long you can take exposures no doubt.  Nice work though, especially for your first stacking attempt!\n\nNot sure what you did for post processing, but the color is a bit one dimensional.  In DSS if you align the RGB and bump up the saturation before saving the photo, you'll have more color to work with in post processing next time ;)"
"Can you still do successful DSO AP with a Nikon? (D5200 to be precise). Is there some other software that's useable?"
"[deleted]"
"It depends on what kind of AP you want to do.\n\nFor example, I have a NexStar 6SE ($700) that when combined with a planetary camera like the ZWO ASI120MC ($300) can take excellent photos of the Moon and planets.  Planetary photography puts most of the emphasis on the framerate of the camera, and captures are very short (no more than 60 seconds if captured at a high FPS).  This means that an alt-az tracking mount like the SE is sufficient to get good captures.\n\nFor deep-space imaging, it's possible to get good results for around $1000-$1500.  I'll direct you to this excellent review for possible equipment choices: http://www.astronomyforum.net/astro-imaging-forum/108138-minimalist-astrophotography.html (be sure to read through all of the comments)\n\nIn general, a basic/beginner DSO AP setup will use a DSLR instead of a dedicated CCD, and foregoes the use of LRGB filters.  The scope is usually a smallish aperture, modest focal length (you want something faster than f/7) on some kind of an equatorial tracking mount (either a GEM or a wedge-mounted fork).  A beginner setup will usually leave off an autoguider, meaning you'll have to be very precise with your polar alignment.  Also, lack of auto-guiding means the effects of periodic error (slight inconsistencies in the size and pitch of the drive gears) will degrade your images somewhat -- you may end up with some \"bloated\" stars or even some minor streaking.\n\nIn general, what I've seen most folks get as a beginner AP setup (the link I provided above is \"minimalist\" AP, which is somewhat different, and for somebody with budget constraints) is a setup such as the following:\n\n* Celestron Advanced VX mount ($800)\n* Fast, 80mm refractor (Good: [Orion ED80: $800](http://www.telescope.com/Telescopes/Refractor-Telescopes/Refractor-Optical-Tube-Assemblies/Orion-ED80-80mm-f75-Apochromatic-Refractor-Telescope/pc/1/c/10/sc/346/p/9895.uts), Better: [Stellarvue SV80T: $1200](http://stellarvue.com/sv80st.html))\n* DSLR with appropriate adapters for 2\" focuser\n\nWith a setup like this, you get the wide field and forgiveness of a modest focal length, while still learning how to use an equatorial mount.  The 80mm scope is somewhat usable for visual work.  It's still probably best to have a second scope for visual, since your AP rig won't be usable while it's taking photos, often for hours at a time.\n\nIf you want to do AP only, and no visual work, the ideal solution is something like a Vixen Polarie, iOptron SkyTracker, or Astrotrac.  These devices are made to fit on a professional photography tripod and work with your DSLR and its own lenses to let you take astrophotos.  This is actually one of the easiest ways to get into AP, as you don't need any extra optical equipment -- you already have a DSLR; a tracking mount simply adds the ability for long exposures with sidereal tracking.\n\nSince you already have a DSLR, you could go this route and still have enough money left over (assuming a $1000 budget) to get an 8\" dobsonian for visual use while your camera is taking photos."

"Thanks for the advice. I had initially replied that I had used tracking in this photo when I had actually used it in another post. I took very short exposures, 1.5 seconds each. My other attempt that I posted after this one was much better. With tracking in was able to get 20 seconds each."
"Since you have a tracking mount, you'll be blown away with longer exposures.  20 seconds is relatively low for Orion.  My last attempts at orion were 90 second exposures with a 400ISO.  Although I'll do a few more rounds soon with 800 and 1600ISO, but I would actually shoot for longer exposure times at a moderate ISO.\n\n[This was 400ISO and 21 exposures at 90 seconds each](http://i.imgur.com/DaagpzA.jpg) - I stacked them in DSS and then aligned the RGB (get them on top of each other, or offset if your camera is modified) in DSS and then brought the saturation up to 18% and hit apply.  After that I did all post processing in PhotoShop elements.\n\nHere is a really good tutorial on post processing: [Astrophotography Processing in Photoshop](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBQQ_Gs6YHM)\n"

"That's amazing considering your lens! The magic of algorithms that harvest many exposures¬°"
"Thanks for that I think I'll go ahead and order the EQ5 with the dual axis motor then. Is it easy to polar align without the polar scope, is it more of a \"ease of use\" purchase? Im guessing that somewhere along the line ill input my latitude on the mount, face it towards polaris and the rest should be in place? Anyway, I'm getting ahead of my self, thanks for the help, I'll let you know how I get on!"
"I use the LCD screen on my Canon to do a polar alignment.  It's more of an \"eyeball it\" approach, but no blurring on 90 second photos and I've done 2 minute exposures which seem to be just fine.  A polar scope will help, and you can get a cheapy for a pretty good price.  \n\nAfter a while you'll find something that works for you.  Some goto mounts actually have a polar alignment function to make it easier.  I just do what works best for me.  You can snag a super basic polar scope for under $50 though."
"[Here's my attempt](http://i.imgur.com/kAwFgA5.jpg) using PixInsight.  I created master darks from the 180 and 240 sec images and then applied them and the master flat to the lights.  I had to throw out about 5 before stacking because of the timber, and then there were about 4 that just would not register to stack, I'm not sure why.  I ended up stacking 16 120s lights and 3 240s lights (41 minutes integration).\n\nThanks for giving me something to process during these cloudy nights.  I swear I've had like 2 clear nights in the last month."

"Nice!  Great job, was looking forward to this and you didn't disappoint.\n\nI think I've had like 2 clear nights in the last month.  *sigh*"
"yeah i think it may be easier with the rings but for me there are not enough rings. i think the most important step is to get the focuser square with the center of the secondary somehow. the moonlite focusers have collimation adjustments or you can get the tip-tilt ring, but you can't install the ring right against the back of the ota, and then even with the 1\" extension i could not reach focus with my reducer‚Ä¶ so i had to remove the tip-tilt ring and just use the focuser controls.\n\nthe secondary comes next and somehow that was easy for me but my primary has a lot of dust so it's easy to see the rings on the primary.\n\ni totally messed up the primary with the collimator. but a defocused star made it obvious how to adjust the primary. i didn't have to mess with the secondary after fixing the primary - it was close enough.\n\nnow i have to repeat the process on the AT10RC‚Ä¶\n"
"well the hot pixels in the light don't get fully corrected by the mismatched dark. this is usually because the temperature of the dark differs from the lights.\n\nthen if you have a little bit of polar misalignment, even if you are auto guiding, you get some frame rotation. or, if you have some differential flexure between your guider and main scope, you get some trailing. either way the hot pixels in the aligned stacks march along in wide arcs or streaks.\n\nin theory you should be able to reject these hot pixels during stacking since they are 'outliers' compared to all the other pixels in the stack. that's what the kappa-sigma rejection in DSS does.\n"
"Hi again. Thanks for the answer. Just a few more questions: (sorry if I'm throwing too many out). Firstly, by auto-guiding do you mean that the mount will not move to track the object (so it will need to be manually moved) or do you mean that the movement of the moun is not at exactly the same rate as the movement - ie it's a guess based on the earth's rotation or something. \n\nSecondly, if you had a vixen polarie and just a dslr with basic lenses, would you be able to see any DSOs (or even andromeda, unsure if it counts as a DSO). And would you need a vixen polarie for the milky way type photos, or can you use a scope type mount for those kinds of photos.\n\nThirdly, would you suggest I get a basic 6\" or 8\" Dobsonian first for fisual use, and then if I enjoy using it I can get a separate (astrophotography specific, maybe?) scope and mount if I'm still interested after some visual work.\n\nLastly, I just noticed your username and felt obliged to say high elves clearly &gt; skaven. Thanks again for the help, it's greatly appreciated."

I have noticed that with some of my equipment, it's easier to use the 2\" extension ring than a 1\".\n\nAre you using a Moonlight focuser on the AT6RC, or is that for the AT10RC?  How do you find the AT10RC, in general?  I was advised by the master optician in my club to skip the bigger Astro-Tech RCs, due to defects he noticed in the AT6RC mirror.  In [this image](http://plaidhat.com/2012-10/2103-2108%20-%20ngc%202023-mod.jpg), for example, he was looking at the pattern to the spikes on Alnitak.  The color pattern to the spikes, he felt, was due to very shallow-but-steep grooves in the mirror, caused by the mechanical grinding process used to create it."

"A typical tracking mount will attempt to move the scope across the sky at the _sidereal rate_, to match the Earth's rotation.  But it does this using the mount's own alignment (which can be imperfect).  So for an equatorial mount (most typical for photography), the RA axis is aligned with the Earth's rotation.  In theory, the mount just has to rotate the RA axis at the sidereal rate and objects will stay perfectly still in the eyepiece/CCD.  But it's still a human that has to set it up, and it won't be perfect.  Plus, the mount itself isn't perfect, and the rotation speed might not perfectly match the sidereal rate, due to (for example) a metal shaving on one of the teeth of the RA gear.\n\nAn _auto guider_ is a supplemental guidance system (usually, a separate scope and camera, bolted to the main telescope) that watches a single star and keeps track of its position.  If the star moves, it feeds corrective movement signals to the mount, which the mount then mixes with its own tracking to improve its accuracy.  When looking at descriptions of astrophotos, you may see the terms \"guided\" and \"unguided\".  They're almost always referring to whether or not they used an auto-guider.\n\nWith a Polarie + DSLR + camera lenses, you won't be able to \"see\" anything at all (it's not a visual setup).  However, the Polarie would stabilize your camera and allow it to track objects in the sky so that you can take long exposures (several minutes) without getting \"star trails\".  The effect is that you can massively increase the amount of light collected with each frame.  Once you've captured the raw data, you run your frames through a software utility called a _stacker_, which \"sums\" the frames together as if you took one super-long (hours) exposure.\n\nWith a DSLR + Polarie, you can take photos of large-scale objects: Milky way panoramas, the Andromeda galaxy (M31), the Pleiades (M45).  Typical photographic lenses have (astrophotography speaking) relatively short focal lengths, so you will be working with fairly large fields of view.  This is actually a benefit for beginning AP though, because the wider the field of view, the less critical your mount's tracking accuracy is.\n\nI would definitely suggest getting a 6 or 8 inch dobsonian scope to get started.  Keep in mind, of course, that what you will see in the eyepiece will be faint, fuzzy, and almost always in black-and-white.  See this page to get a feel for what things look like visually through a telescope: http://www.buytelescopes.com/t/101_1HowThingsLook\n\nIf you're truly interested in both visual and photographic astronomy, then I _personally_ recommend splitting your budget between a 6-8 inch dobsonian scope and something like a Polarie.  Practice AP with the Polarie and your DSLR, and practice visual observation with the Dob.  Eventually you'll end up upgrading one or both rigs, but that's OK -- both of them will hold their value pretty well.\n\nI recommend taking a look at this page as well, which introduces you to the basics of using a telescope: http://eyesonthesky.com/Blog/tabid/80/EntryId/179/The-Ultimate-Beginners-Guide-to-Telescopes-and-Amateur-Astronomy.aspx\n\n"
"Can you?  Sure.  Is it as simple and tailored to AP?  No.\n\nIs there other software...yes, but most folks report varying levels of \"useless\" to \"Eh...doesn't help all that much\" from what I've seen.  I may be missing something new or different, however, not shooting a Nikon. :)\n\nIs there anything with near the level of functionality/features as BYE?  Not even close.\n\nThe author of BYE **is**, however, working feverishly on BackyardNIK, and hopes for a Beta this spring or summer.  One can only presume that it will make the Nikons do pretty much anything they're physically capable of, and do it in an AP sort of way. :)"
"a fap with ph on the front instead of f :)"
"I sure hope so. I got my D5200 before I knew about astrophotography, but hopefully BYN will come out before I begin to regret the decision."
"Ah. Thats funny because i wrote you enjoyed yourself. Now i get it. :-3\n\nHeh. "
"I dont know jack shit about this subreddit, but damn I love it"
" Dafuq? Why didn't i see any of them? They're gorgerous."
"Great collection and nice collage. That Saturn image is incredible!"
"Next step is to dress properly. It's the first thing we do in this hobby.\n\nOther than that, great start."

"Outstanding!"
"Thanks! :)"
"Gorgeous, Pix!"
"Please provide details on your imaging setup."
"Capture details?  :-)  *&lt;nudge&gt; &lt;nudge&gt;*"
"We arrived home last night from late night revelry (catching a movie!) and looked up to see perfect skies. With the imminent multi-day snowstorm, I ran in and camped out on the Rosette, adding another 5 frames each of RGB to a previous night.\n\nThe Olmsted Observatory: Tak FSQ-106 + SBIG STL-11000m + Paramount ME.\n\n11 x 600 s RGB, processed in PixInsight.\n\nI ran Dynamic Background Extraction on each channel separately (I usually combine first) with a model from a deeper image so that I didn't eliminate the little IFN that I had.\n\nSeveral rounds of Local Histogram Equalization, Saturation curves, and Morphological erosion to reduce dominant stars.\n\nGearing up to teach all of this to two new classes of students next week, so I've got to get my chops together!"
"Some of the images have acquisition details on them already, but if you want details for a specific image, ask and I will happily provide them! All images were taken with a Canon EOS 1100D. The ones that I used a telescope to capture were taken with an Orion ED80 or a Celestron Omni XLT 150, both with a Celestron CG-4 mount."
"As soon as I posted, my kids asked me to pass part of LEGO Indiana Jones for them, so I caved!"
"man that's a lot of exposure :)"
"I did apply is, but as I've mentioned in the past, I'm really really really bad with PI. Yours looks vastly superior to my attempt."
