"Thanks I'll post it!"
"I want to note they do have armpit vents... I have this jacket.\n&gt;Feature List\n100% Seam Taped, Angel-Wing Movement, Attached Adjustable Hood, Chest Pocket with Water-Resistant Zipper, Elastic Draw Cord Hem, **PitZips**, Storm Flap over Zipper with Snap/Velcro Closure, Zippered Hand Pockets"
"I have the Marmot and I like it a lot. \n\n* Huge pit vents allows for great venting, plus you can even slip your arms through the vents to put in your warmer midlayer pockets (think down coat under rain coat). \n* The hood is awesome. Seems a little large at first, but then in downpours, you realize how awesome it is to have a hood that extends several inches beyond your forehead.\n* Very waterproof, but the DWR seemed to wear off after 2-3 seasons (I think is normal), so I just applied some Nikwax and it's back to awesome.\n* The one thing I have myself wishing is maybe going a little nicer to 3 layer goretex for even better breathing, but I don't mind just wearing a wicking base layer for when I'm busting uphill."

"Thanks so much! We went earlier today on the blue route- the snow was great! Lots of places just off the main trail with untouched snow- that was my first time and now I'm hooked :)"
"I too, am gleefully looking for potential off the grid cabin property, albeit in Northern Wisconsin."
"Haha, thanks! I love my Versacamm. So empowering being able to make whatever I want. I also have a 54in cold press laminator for larger jobs. I suppose I should mention that I have a printing business on the side so it's not like I just have $20,000 to throw around on plotters. :)"
"not sure what type of vehicle you'll be traveling in but one of my favorite things that we did in Death Valley was the back country camping we did for one night. We drove for a while on a random back country road and just parked our car and pitched the tent in the middle of nowhere. Great fun. Also-fill up your gas tank before going in or getting close to the NP. Not many towns/gas stations close by and Death Valley is huge."
"I have no doubt the weather gets bad in the Whites. But 'worst in America?' I get the impression such a superlative disclaimer is needed because of the relative proximity of those mountains to populated areas and too many people going out in jeans, stories like the top comment here.\n\nThere are lists of people dead and freezing weather in the summer all over the mountains of the US."

"That's fantastic! Congrats on your new enterprise. Are you on the web/how much would that sign cost? It would make a great living room decoration."
"I proposed to my wife during sunrise on top of mt washington"
"I don't think you'll need the sign."
"Thanks! Yeah, I've got this and some others on sale [here](https://www.etsy.com/shop/trailsigns), I make custom trail signs and also keep a few things like this in stock. "
"Mt Washington usually claims the title for \"worst *recorded* weather\" because there is a weather station conveniently located at the top."
"Best of luck in business. The signs 1 0 1 forum is a great resource if you ever need help from others in the industry."
"I like the \"Who needs a car to climb Mt. Washington\" bumper sticker. \n\nWhenever I see the \"This car climbed Mt. Washington\" bumper stickers, I can't help but cringe. That's why I hate hiking Mt. Washington in the summer. I get to the top, and I see all these cars at the parking lot and all of the fat people being unloaded from the cog train. And not to mention the line that sometimes forms at the \"Mt. Washington Summit\" sign. It makes you think that summiting the highest mountain in the Northeast is just worthless. "
"From a meteorological standpoint, the Presidentials are conveniently situated right under the Jetstream and parallel to the Atlantic Ocean. The mountains are essentially a catcher's mitt for all of the storm systems from the west via the Jetstream and it protects the low pressure systems near the coastline. The gradient between them create such fierce winds that the highest wind ever recorded by man at 231 mph was recorded on the summit. \n\nAnd the prominence of the Presidentials are another reason why it earns that nickname. It can be well over 90 degrees in Pinkham Notch, whereas, the summit has a temperature of about 50 degrees. All in a 4,000 foot vertical difference. \n\nAlthough \"worst in the country\" may be exaggerated a bit, it sure is one of the worst. The Presidentials compared to the relatively temperate climate of the east coast just shows how crazy it can really be.  "
"For a Aug 1 entry, the application date opens on Feb 14. They prefer fax, and you can fax in the night before to get first in line. It's really easy to get your first choice if you do it the earliest they allow you to apply.\n\nAll of this information is available on their website. \nhttp://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/wildpermitdates.htm"
"GSMNP isn't too far a drive from Cincinnati.. though I'm not so sure on what the conditions there are like at the beginning of March. I have a feeling it'd still be a bit early to be too warm there yet. "
"Well I just checked mine, and you're right. The Marmot does have pit zips. Not sure if I didn't notice them for the last seven months or just forgot about them."

"I'm pretty sure Gossamer Gear is like that, and ULA Equipment."
"Yes! Awesome thank you\n\n"
"Hit Mt. Washington and a lot of the other presidentials in august as part of an AT hike. Low 50's and 30' visibility in the middle of the day in the warmest part of summer. Do not fuck with the whites."
"I laughed a little when I read this :D. I'm glad I could help; they come in very useful on the trail. Have a good New Years!"
"[Into the Wild]( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Into_the_Wild_(book) ) is a great book about a young man that wasn't prepared for the Alaskan wilderness. "
"I'll take a look at those. I'm also a SAR volunteer."

"I passed that sign in wind and rain. That was unnerving."
"I spent an unscheduled night in the AMC Greenleaf Hut just below Mt. Layette because of bad weather, this was in June. All night long the AMC staffers were bringing tourist down off the peak, most were wearing shorts and sneakers and suffering from hypothermia. There's also a sign in Pinkham Notch Visitor Center that states 'The Best Dressed Corpses wear Cotton\" \n"
"Does it actually have the worst weather?"
"That's got to be one hell of a ride."
"Excellent work.  Wish the White mountains would replace more of their signs.  Some of the trail signs still up were placed there by my Dad who has been retired for 20 years now.  Spent most of his life as a Forest Ranger for the White Mountain National Forest."
"Ha! Tell me about it. I thruhiked in 2013, Southbound. Well, I got injured in NC but hiked 1850 miles. Anyway, when I summited Mount Washington, after hiking through one of the wettest Junes on record in Maine, into New Hampshire and into the White Mountains, up the Presidential Ridge, weeks on the trail... and I had to wait in line to get a summit pic, behind tourists who'd driven up. It was kind of surreal, a little irritating, but I was proud to have done it, even if no one else knew or cared.  A lot of people treat Mt. Washington as just another sightseeing stop, and that's okay, but I feel lucky to be in the club that realizes what an important, beautiful and spiritual place it really is. "

"Are you looking for local to you companies or cottage industry businesses that specialize in making gear targeted at hikers/backpackers? I suspect you're looking for the latter.\n\n[Here's one list](http://blackwoodspress.com/blog/12378/cottage-backpacking-gear-directory/). It was posted in 2012, so I'm not sure how up to date it is."
"Well in my city we have a \"local\" company that makes backpacks and chalk bags (Granola Products) and they sell online and to companies that also sell across the states. like u/cloudedice said more the cottage industry businesses "
"12?"
"I need to print that on a pair of panties for my gf."
"...and? Wherever humans may go, occasionally they will die. Considering the volume of visitors to NPs every year, death rates are probably surprisingly low. \n\nAlso, I'd rather my passing have me surrounded by nature's incredible beauty and doing something that I love, rather than suffering from a middle-age heart attack at a terminal in the middle of a nondescript cubicle farm. "
"Joshua tree skin care is cottage industry. "
"Do you know of any place that sells replica trail signs(maybe this is you)? I thought a replica of a wooden trail sign would be a cool thing to hang on the wall but I've never been able to find one. The AMC auctions off trail signs they replace, but the price they go for is much more than I'm willing to spend. "
"Plus in addition to that California is about to go into severe drought conditions. It's been so dry!"
"[Equipment Necessary for Camping](http://campingforbeginners.org/)"
"Damn. Washington has killed people for lesser mistakes. That's super lucky. Glad they got out."
"navigation is a bit wonky, took like 3-4 clicks to find the list."
"Shut up and take my money!\n\nThat bumper sticker is excellent.  During my epic \"Presidential Range in a day\" hike, I got to the top of Mt. Washington and was immediately surrounded by 300 people.  There's a big difference between the people who do the climb the mountain the RIGHT way!"
"I've done GSMNP in March. Needs a 20 degree bag but totally doable/fun. Highly recommend and beginner friendly area. GSMNP has a good amount of people and it's full of water. "
"Great list, but you don't need all of this gear to go camping. All you really need is a sleeping bag, bug dope, matches, food and a can/bottle opener. "
"*Necessary* is not the word I would use to describe that lot; more like a bunch of car camping luxuries.  In fact nothing is necessary for camping - sleeping under the stars on a folded jacket is one of my guilty pleasures in Joshua Tree NP."
"close\n"
"Have gone to Ruidoso many times since I was a kid. I love it there. "
"This is more the purview of /r/camping I should think rather than this subreddit. The gear they're describing is more for stationary camping (like car camping or with pack animals) than backpacking. \n\nThat said, I agree with others that you not necessarily even need everything on this list. "

"Thank you!  I definitely felt very anxious and couldn't sleep the nights before because I had no idea what awaited me\n\noh and the island was INFESTED with spiders!  I am so happy that I moved from that first camp spot!"

"Nice video. Thanks for sharing it! Something in your video gave me the impression that you had left your job to travel and hike. Is that true? If so (and you dont mind me asking) how has it been and how have you funded it?"
"This is actually exactly what I do, for the most part. Check [this](https://www.etsy.com/shop/trailsigns) message me through reddit or etsy and we'll talk!"
"Sleeping bags, quilts, and other down gear:\n\nhttp://www.nunatakusa.com/ ... custom-made gear from Washington state. Pricey, but I have the Arc Specialist, and it is excellent.

I don't have any personal experience with this gear, but their prices are lower than Nunatak.\n\nClimbing gear:\n\nhttp://mistymountain.com/ ... made in North Carolina.

"Stopped reading after \"hammer.\" Sorry."
"Nice film!\n\nWhat I enjoyed about this was that it was *personal*. You had the courage to put yourself and your thoughts up there, and did a great job. It's really *hard* to express yourself properly in film! So congrats!\n\nI almost didn't post the rest of this as you didn't ask for feedback, but it seems you are interested in the business, so maybe you'd want to hear a little constructive criticism from a jaded many-year mega-expeditioner/guide and fellow amateur filmmaker:\n\n* I feel like the trip, while cool, was maybe *overstated*... eg \"I cannot count the number of times that I said to myself how dangerous it is what I am doing right now\"... ***cool*** way to start a film, but I'm guessing many many people here would not consider that 3 day camping trip particularly extreme.\n* The images were quite generic handheld. Some were nice, especially the multi-clone hike and the clouds during the rain scene, but most could have been much better, and the jerky timelapses were a real missed opportunity (take more batteries/memory next time!). I almost gave up, but...\n* The voiceover is really entertaining, sets the film apart from the mass of other GoPro shorts.\n* That said, the VO sometimes presented *opinion* as *fact*...eg 'often when you journey alone it is easy to be overwhelmed with pessimism'... this is just not even *vaguely* true for everyone... it's an introspection, not a truth. \n* I know how hard it is to write thoughtful VO, but some other parts didn't work for me either: 'train ourselves to remain focused' is kinda beginner-talk, and 'conquer ourselves' is meaningless.\n* I have no idea of your background, but you kinda *appear* inexperienced! ie it simply rained and \"I'm gonna try and not be frustrated\"... and those noises seem like distressed nesting birds (and you're digging around for them!)... and yeah, in general the VO feels somewhat lacking *perspective* :)\n* It was about the right length, well done making an entertaining 7min film!\n\nBut yeah, overall I thought it was a great job, thanks for sharing :)"
"Thank you, your feedback is HIGHLY appreciated!  This is only my first film and hearing this gives me a direction to take in the next one!  \n\nIt turns out those noises were frogs (I was worried about injuring creatures as well, so I was very careful when pushing the grass apart).\n\nCheers and thank you!"
"I'm so glad you take feedback really well!\n\nYeah, all my thoughts are just 'imho' *tweaks*... it's a cool short as is :)\n\nAnd it's your *first try*! I've made quite a lot of shorts for many years and I'm *still* struggling with VO!\n\nAnd I should have mentioned the positives a bit more: of course there was lots of the VO that was just great :) \n\nGood luck, I look forward to seeing your next film :)"
