"Tensors break pretty easy, get some ventures or indies "
"Mmmyyeap thats what strikes me too; thats a damn sharp shot.\n\nOn a sidenote, im always bothered when the bar is that close to the back truck, on a boardslide"
"Yeah there is a different feel from taking stuff on street to tranny. Street is all about your weight going down where on tranny you feel alot more weightless as your weight moves up a wall. Backsides are always easier than frontsides for me. Start on small trannies and then take them to bigger ones. For me even if i have something on a small ramp, taking it to a bigger one isnt as easy as you think. Mental blocks and speed are my big factors. It takes time to get over this. \n\nRereading your question i am unsure what you are asking. Haha"

"Yeah I live in LA area ( Canoga Park) the only skate shops I have nearby are Boarders and Zumiez. I could but my trucks wheels bearings etc at the shop, but they don't have the deck I want so I thought I might as well buy everything online."
"Pushing mongo is never a good habit. Switching should be top Priority."
"I can understand not getting the deck you want but consider that supporting your local community skateshop is a good thing. For example Cowtown in Phoenix Az is our local shop, and they are really nice and cool to all the kids that want to learn. These guys actually got skatepark development started in our area through lobbying and city council meetings. They are the real deal and are quite selfless while still being able to run a business in that sense. \n\nGoogle Unified Skate Supply, it looks like they are the guys in your town to support.\n\nEdit: After a closer look they are a distributor not a shop. There's another place called Xtreme Skate Shop but that name seams dicey. If they are close enough give them a call and feel them out to see if they are nice or not."
"Yes"
"try and switch as soon as possible, it's not worth the inconvenience in the long-run"
"Yes you should be pushing regular.\n\nThe setup is simpler, you just turn your foot and put your back foot on the tail, rather than turning your back foot and adjusting your front foot position.  \n\nYour front foot is already in position in regular."

"Just so you know all those dudes are Longboarders, for skating street it might be a bit different if you are trying to approach rails and sets of stairs or any obstacles.  These guys are just pushing until they are going downhill to hill bomb basically. "
"I didn't even notice this wasn't /r/longboarding when I posted this lol"
"I just noticed this was r/skateboarding, if you're doing street stuff on a short board mongo can dick you up, but just get a longer board so you don't put your back foot on the truck, that's where most of the shit starts"

I asked him if he wanted to watch more skate videos then he just gave me the funniest look I've ever seen, then I realized that he probably seen the thumbnail. That kid is fucked and will probably never try skateboarding, ever."
"Man push however you want to push. When I started skating I pushed mongo, and then started pushing regular and to be honest I don't think it made a difference to my tricks at all. If anything, pushing mongo probably helped me learn 1 foot manuals better than any of my mates"

"I was a hardcore mongo pusher and made the switch to pushing reg. I'm glad I did because I think it looks better, but the best part is now I push switch as good as I push reg because of all the mongo pushing. Also when you go from mongo to reg you start working out your other leg!"
"Nice filming man!"
"Its not the risers bro, its you. If dudes can put trucks on a 2x4 and kickflip, then you can ollie with a board that sits a god damn 1/8 of an inch higher. Dudes used to ollie over trashcans with 1 inch risers in the 80s. Go to ride channel and look up a video on how to ollie higher. "

"The indoor park I skate at always have music on, it ranges from American Rap, Australian Rap, 70's - 80's Rock, just basically everything. When they first started playing music they were worried there would be complaints, but even though the majority of people that ride their are 18 and under, everyone loves the music!"
"Used to happen to me all the time. Loosen your kingpin nut and rotate your bushings 180 degrees on both trucks. This will cause your board to lean the opposite way now obviously but this is where you need to stop being heal heavy on your deck. Use those toes amigo, be equal on both sides. It might take some balls, for lack of a better word, because leaning on one side or the other is easier to escape in a bail, but it will pay off in spades once you are comfortable.\n\nEdit: I'm assuming you ride regular for some reason."
"Westgate, Reider, and Gillette all have better pop *and* style. Those are just off the top of my head, but they all have pop out the ass. "
"You just have to force yourself to switch over. After a few days you won't go back. You can set up for tricks faster and have a more powerful, faster push if you push regular. Also mongo just looks terrible. "

"youre literally so unfortunate man i think your risers will have to stay on for the rest of eternity"

Btw i know how to skate goofy( my stance) and i honestly cant feel a difference if your comfortable with mongo stay mongo from your friendly neighborhood mongo pusher XD"
"Im the skater he was talking about. What he meant was that my board has gotten razor tail, and its chipping all over the edges of my board. I dont really do any tricks that would mess it up, other than when i screw up flip tricks and land on it upside down. I mainly just skate flat ground, banks, and manual pads."

There's a lot, you just gotta find them."
"i think theyre called the [chukka low](http://www.tactics.com/a/55wo/9/vans-chukka-low-skate-shoes-white-light-grey.jpg) if I'm not mistaken. Are they something like the link i put up? I've had a few pairs of 'em and I loved them."
"this is probably a stupid question since i'm only just coming back to skating after a few years, but why skate with the nose at the back when they're purposefully different lengths? "
"never heard of any of those fools."
"gee whiz dude u sure insulted me there\n\nhey jamie thomas is on the phone, he needs defending again"
"not a stupid question, couple reasons.\n\nfirstly, to keep the trucks from leaning hard to one side like in OP's situation. This is particularly a problem if you keep your trucks pretty tight- if you only skate with the tail always at the back, the board will lean to the point of fucking up your skating. Secondly, switching the nose and tail up from time to time will make your deck last longer- wearing the nose and tail down gives you more time to skate it, as opposed to blowing out your tail and needing a new deck, despite having a perfectly fine nose.\n\nI'm not saying switch the board up every other trick, but spend some time here and there skatin with the board rotated like that"
"Know and use both dude!\nBecause why the fuck not? \nI push regular mostly because when you're doing a line it just looks better than mongo period. But mongo is fine if you're like me and never got you driver's license so you're tired of pushing regular to get across town to donate plasma for weed money. Plus you will have learned to push regular when you're skating switch. And that's badass. \n\n"
"Well, it's good you're listing skaters who skate switch more in general. Really interesting stuff, but I'm more curious to which skater mostly skated switch in their part of which video.\n\nI'm not sure if this is valid, but Shane O'Neill in his SB Chronicles Vol. 2 part can be one example. "

"I usually try and support local shops over Zumiez, since they are the corporate chain that pretty much shuts down all local shops the moment they open in your town (unless that shop is well established) and steal customers.\n\nBut if you have no local shops then Zumiez is probably faster than ordering online if you need it now. "
"actual rebar isn't 100% necessary, but you do need *something* in the crete to reinforce it, or it will be susceptible to cracking really soon... chunks of chainlink fence works well for small stuff. a rebar cage is usually tied together with wire. you really only need to know how to weld if you're doing steel coping, which usually must be welded to the cage if you want it to stay put for more than a few weeks. \n\n\nand that rubber mat under your parking block probably did more harm than good by allowing the block to shift under load. use mortar.\n\n\nalso, /r/DIYSkatespots "

"that yoni deck is a skateboard in my eyes, as it's got the regular popsicle shape and isn't so large that you'd need to use longboard specialised trucks on it. i would happily skate that deck, with the trucks and wheels that i already use on my skateboard. [these are also all skateboards](https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcT1S1_K8SaFZBaUlmX-SsHIloxdObMFTfd-rV9bUHnvHTSdygqI).\n\nin my eyes when a board stops being a skateboard (please don't call it a shortboard) and becomes a longboard is when you can no longer do regular skateboard tricks (ie transition, ledges, flatground) to a degree at which all other skateboards can. i know you can drop in etc on some longboards, but you won't exactly be throwing up backside airs or inverts on a longboard. the same goes for ledges - you can't do a crook or a back tail on a longboard, but you can on a skateboard, even ones like your example."
