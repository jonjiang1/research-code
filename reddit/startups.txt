"Hi! Thanks for doing this AMA. I am late to the party so I hope you still see this :)\n\nIf you find a good place to discuss flat orgs, please let me know! I help run a [collective hub](http://www.enspiral.com) for such companies in New Zealand, and out of that we grew a [tool](http://www.loomio.org) specifically to help flat orgs make good decisions as a group (maybe it would be useful for you?). \n\nOur company is structured as a worker-owned cooperative with no bosses and circular org chart, and we are trying to innovate a lot when it comes to processes for distributed leadership. \n\nWe use Balsamiq and love it! Thanks for what you've created :)"
"Can you explain why I would use twitter to start and not just concurrently have twitter and a site? "
"because you're wasting your time if you're unable to validate and build a userbase.  If you get enough twitter followers you can eventually funnel that to your website.  Build up your userbase first on just twitter to see if people actually care what you have to say.  you may think you offer good advice but if people that do know about FFS and aren't following you, more than likely its because no one cares what you have to say."
"I know you were asking Giacomo, not me, but I can recommend Pivotal and Tello as good tools for distributed teams, supported by Google Hangouts, and a Google+ community and Hipchat for general conversation.\n\nAlso, we make a [tool](http://www.loomio.org) specifically for collaborative decision making which I (of course) think is extremely useful for this kind of group (it's open source and you can access it free, so honestly this is not a marketing plug)."
"corecto-mundo.  just fixed it.  I'm an idiot.  thanks."
"basically I was going to take all the news from actual sports analyst and put them on an easy to navigate site so people won't have to go looking for this info on twitter.\n\nInstead of using one source, they just come to the site and see what's happening on mine. \n\nI'm not offering expertise, just offering a site where people can see everything on one page instead of scouring the web for up-to-the-minute info. \n\nI won't be charging money or anything for the site. Just seeing if there is a way to make income through advertising, not sure how that works. \n\n"
"Is your handbook public? I would love to see it! I am a big student of different flat org's handbooks, such as Valve, Semco, Morning Star, etc. I wish there was a great learning community for this kind of thing, since I think a lot of us around the world are reinventing the wheel in isolation when we should be sharing knowledge instead :)"
"**1. Name/URL:** [Konkoro](http://www.konkoro.com)\n\n**2. What I do:** Basically the idea is something like Goodreads, except instead of just dealing with books it tackles books, movies, videogames, tv, and music. The hope is that for the average person there's value in only going to one portal to track/talk/find entertainment. The database is intentionally small at the moment as I'm just testing (I'm working on finding ways to jumpstart it before I launch).\n\n**3. What I'm looking for:** I'd love some feedback on the idea, implementation, and any features that might be useful."

"Altogether, the video took me roughly 10 hours to make (writing the script, creating visuals and putting the video together). However, I had never used the program before let alone made an explainer video, so I was learning while doing. It’s a really great program, very fun to use."
"Not sure if I'm too late, but if you are still answering questions, I've got one! \n\nWe are an open source project interested in doing participatory design with [our user community](https://www.loomio.org/groups/3). It can be challenging because many users are trying to help, but they have limited understanding of technical challenges behind desired features, how they fit into the larger road map, or good principles of design, UX, development. \n\nHowever we love our users and love that they care about improving our tool with us, and care deeply about getting constructive feedback and collaborating with them. \n\nI think building up a strong culture and good guidelines around creating mockups would be fantastic - it would help people communicate clearly what they mean, challenge them to solve the real problems and recognize the difficulty, and lead to great new ideas coming out. How would you recommend training non-technical people about making good mockups and discussing them?"
"Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the advice. Wouldn't it be beneficial to have twitter and site that work concurrently"
"Happy New Year!\n\n**1. Name / URL**: [Twitter Microtrending App](http://micro.itrend.tv/)\n\n**2. What do you do?** We wrote this minimalist app to help people who follow a lot of people on Twitter (e.g. journalists, news writers, bloggers, etc).  The app looks at the people you follow, and starts tracking their tweets' \"velocity\" as they get Retweeted and/or Favorited - then show you Top 5 most interesting tweets.\n\nIt essentially compresses your whole Twitter timeline into 5 tweets that are *now* getting a lot of attention, in real time.\n\n**3. Are you looking for anything? (Feedback/Hiring/etc)** Feedback, comments, suggestions.  Try to break it.  Ideas on pricing are also appreciated (we're trying to decide whether this should be a small monthly subscription, or a paid app instead)."
"Cool app.  Is \"discovery\" somehow based on how I rate other things?"
"&gt; Soundcry\n\nInteresting concept. However, I just realized that I don't usually like artists on genres on FB… but I am sure a lot of people do. \n\nThe site is nice - simple, yet conveys the main idea.\n\nMy only concern *as a user* would be with the app permission model:\n\n&gt; \"Soundcry will receive the following info: your public profile, friend list and email address.\"\n\nDoes FB oath support a less threatening set of permissions, e.g. w/o email addresses etc?"
"It happens. "
"twitter is pretty much news aggregators.  FB, g+ and twitter has pretty much replaced rss or how people used to use rss.  I think any of these solutions would be appropriate to test the quality of your content"
"? I know I can sell it for quite a bit. \n\nI'm curious as to why you think this"
"Nope, right now it's just reddit-ish type posts, which I'll be adding filtering/searching to soon. I'm planning on adding a page for recommendations based on ratings, but I need a database of users with ratings before I can compute, and provide that, so I'm putting it off until I see whether or not this'll get any traction."
"show HN perhaps?"
"This is really cool for in-house marketing teams, IMHO. \n\nEspecially if you can combine it with Geckoboard, or an iPad that gets mounted in a an office, or any kind of similar dashboards. \n\nI will pay money if you build a \"pro\" version that has multiple pages, where each page is a group of users that I can specify. For example, I want a \"Startup Leaders\" page, a \"World News\" page, a \"Fun &amp; Games\" page, etc.\n"
"Good idea. Consider comparing your recommendations with other web leaders, such as Amazon, Netflix, even Google autocomplete. \n\nMy suggestion for you is your business value may be the reverse of what you're expecting: rather than one portal, you could offer a lot more by boosting other recommendation services. For example when I'm browsing Netflix, your service could simultaneously show me recommendations for books and music.\n"

"To have a site, you will have to invest time or money (or both) to build it.  cmdrNacho is suggesting, and I agree, to use one of the existing platforms that tens of million of people are already using to validate that a market exists for your service, that you can differentiate from any existing competitors and that your content is well received before making that investment in a site.  \n\nAs for driving traffic to the site once you get to that point, you're going to have to take a crash course in SEO, PPC and re targeting campaigns, social media marketing and content marketing.  Do some market research to determine who is your addressable market and what channels are most viable to reach them.  Some of this intelligence will come to you organically once you start validating and build a base. \n\nAnyway, cmdrNacho gave you great advice.  \n\n"

"If you plan on raising money on AngelList or from Venture Capital firms, you'll need to incorporate before then. Otherwise you can form an LLC to protect your personal assets if the company goes bankrupt. You should do this before you start signing contracts and the like. \nForming an LLC can cost a little more than incorporating, but its not taxed separately from the owners, so if you expect to earn a profit soon (instead of raising VC money), it makes sense to do an LLC.

In fact, I think I might have gone even further and looked for a senior programmer as a co-founder, giving them some equity (not necessarily 50%).\n\nBasically running a software company requires someone who knows A LOT about technology and writing and shipping or hosting software...there are so many tech-related decisions to make...if you can't find a co-founder, I'd go for full-time employee over external contractors so that whatever they learn along the way stays with the company."

"That's a tough one. Learning how to make good, simple UIs takes a long time, and not everyone has the right predisposition for it (there's a reason 'UX expert' is a profession...).\n\nWhat I would do if I were you is definitely to encourage people to submit their designs...I bet there will be good nuggets in most of them. For those that you think are sub-par, try to figure out the ideas behind the design that the author was trying to convey, the problems they were trying to solve. Then maybe propose an alternate design that solves those same issues in a more elegant way, I bet the original author will love it too.\n\nIn general, you could also try to spread UX knowledge to everyone, by offering courses or pointing them to resources that might help them: we built [UX Apprentice](http://www.uxapprentice.com) just for this purpose, it's a starting point.\n\nHTH!"

"I have always thought about this scenario. If I were you with a family of 5, I would go work for someone else. \n\nOr, I would partner up with someone to share the burden."
"I started out doing this early in my career, and the same thing happened.  What I found worked out better (for me, at least) was a smaller 25-33% retainer for the larger projects, and a payment schedule based on milestones.\n\nIf the project was to be a six month project, then I'd create 4-6 milestones that I tried to align with the first week of a month, so I'd hopefully be paid in plenty of time to pay my bills.\n\nBasing payments on milestones, I was able to take on multiple clients at once, spread my time among them, therefore keep my mind fresh on different projects every day or so to avoid burnout.\n\nThe money ended up being great, my stress and health improved, and before I knew it, I ended up having to hire a few grunts to do most the work, and I relaxed into a management position for the most part."
"Can you not employ someone?"
"I've considered this. I've even taken a position at one point, and immediately withdrew when I considered I was making a mistake.\n\nI can sell myself as a freelance, and I can meet our budget requirements doing it. But I can't justify the same amount as a developer in the workforce yet.  \n\nEdit: Just to clarify, the average salary for intermediate web developers in my area is $50-$70k.  As the single breadwinner in my family, that isn't enough."
"I can help you and would like to discuss a possible partnership with you. Feel free to pm/send email."
"&gt; But I can't justify the same amount as a developer in the workforce yet.\n\nHuh?  If you can justify it to end clients, working for someone else is essentially 'another client' and they can afford to pay you something you can live on, with the added benefit of better cash flow and ideally less stress.\n\n"
"It sounds like you've already identified part of the problem - 50/50 up front and at the end.  This probably feels good on paper to some clients, but ime only works for really small projects.  Something larger will require shorter billing periods (1 month?).\n\nBy fixed rate, do you mean a fixed price for the project?  Are you dealing with scope creep at all?"
"Very nice write-up."
"Big projects shouldn't be handled 50/50, they should be billed by stages complete, what constitutes a 'stage' is up to you but going 25/25/25/25 will ease the load on you. \n\nTo get the spark back either consider taking smaller jobs *or* put the feelers out for people who can lighten the load for you. I know the temptation is always to go after the bigger contracts, it feels like more stable work, more reliable clients, easier on the finances but as you've experienced it comes with at a cost and it's not always worth it.\n\nSide projects are good if you have the mentality for them, if you choose the *right* side project. Again the temptation is there to do the same stuff you do now, to develop.. but be weary of starting up side projects that are ultimately just more of your job. You don't want to be staring at code 8 hours/day, finish up, go eat and then dabble in your side project which is more staring at code. Either do something entirely different, or keep it light.. like tutoring, blogging or silly stuff. \n\nLastly, **but most importantly** try and get better at these two things;\n\n1.) Estimating project length. ALWAYS give yourself plenty of wiggle room, build in *\"I'm a moron, why did I do it that way? Time to rewrite..*\" time, build in client phone call time, learning time, unproductive time and \"*Why the hell won't this API work?*\" time. \n\nThis doesn't mean take longer for the same price either, your clients will *probably* pay more than you think they will. Pick the odd job here and there and bump your quote a bit, just see what they say. You'll be pleasantly surprised.\n\n2.) Learn to say **no**. Scope creep is the devils weaponry, you need to shut it down immediately. Be firm with your clients, agree up front exactly what the project entails and make it clear that if halfway through they want something different then they can wait until this project is finished, then start up a second one with you to make the changes. \n\nAgain, you'll be pleasantly surprised how most clients react. They test the waters, they don't always understand just how much work can go into the 'little' things and usually if you put it in terms of \"*You're not paying for that, so I'm not doing it*\".. they get it."
"If you can sell yourself well, maybe you can try raising prices."
"In order to make $90k+ per year, I'm going to have to move locations and/or become a better developer. Right now, if I took a position soley as a developer for another business in my location, my value to them would probably be in the $70k range, and that is not enough.\n\nAs a business owner, I can sell myself for more than that, then turn around and wear 4 different hats that help cut costs to make the amount that I need.\n\nI suppose it gives to the adage that entrepreneurs are unemployable."
"1. Make Do http://makedo.in \n\n2. Events, hands on workshops, conferences, seminars, meet ups and the like. Mainly working with people in the web development and design sector but branching out in 2014 to more varied topics. We currently have workshops for Node.js, Advanced Saas, Mastering HTML5/CSS3, Advanced WordPress and a front end bootcamp in the works and I'm scoping venues for our next big conference which will be in the North of England over the summer. \n\n3. Feedback and validation would be awesome. But we desperately need experienced and knowledgeable experts to run workshops with us. Any topics and ideas welcome, we work alongside experts to grow ideas into valuable content and make their workshops happen. "
"Yes, fixed rate for small projects feels great. But I've quickly learned it's not appropriate for larger web applications. And scope creep, despite learning some valuable lessons about it early on in my career, has become a constant problem due to taking on more projects than I have energy (and outsourcing them would simply mean losing the money I'm trying to make from them in the first place, even if the cost was marginal)."
"I always screw up with the estimates. This is solid advice. Thanks."
"Founder of wonderthemes.com here (closed WordPress theme marketplace). \n\nGreat idea, looks well executed. \n\nMy advice:\n\n- launch with a lot of quality products and keep the vendor tied in somehow (I offered 95 percent of sales revenue for early adoption) \n\n- don't fear ThemeForrest. I spent too much time looking over my shoulder and less trying to be different. You can't compete with their scale and market share so just do your own thing. \n\n- don't obsess over the technology or how you'll scale. I wasted all my money on building a custom system when I could have launched an MVP that used a basic manually updated eCommerce system. \n\n- give away free stuff. It's the best way to get people to interact. Just ask for an email address in return. \n\nGood luck :-) "
"This is exactly what I do.\n\nExcept each milestone is a deliverable, and I develop and plan more iteratively. So it's like 4-6 mini projects. I try not to let a \"sub project\" or \"milestone\" last more than 3-4 weeks, if it does, I break it up again.\n\nThe other benefit of this, is when it comes to non-payment. If you ever have a client that can't or won't pay, it's for a much smaller amount, and any dispute is much smaller and much less important to both yourself and the client.\n\nIt also allows you to get feedback at a much earlier stage, which you can incorporate into future stages.\n\nSo yeah, how I work:\n\n * 30% retainer for entire project up front.\n * Project broken up into small, deliverable sub-projects, to be delivered roughly 1/month.\n * 70% balance of sub-project payable on delivery.\n * Feedback and discussion with client at each stage. Sometimes this can be as simple as \"everything good, keep going.\" Sometimes I leave the entire quotation and planning of the next stage until the previous stage has been delivered.. depending on how predictable the project seems and client preferences.\n\nHope this helps!"

"Where are you located?  Most cities have an informal group of angel investors.  Near me (Charlotte, NC) there are several groups that meet a few times per month.  \n\nTry contacting the closest university to you and see if they have an entrepreneurship program or office of technology transfer.  email/call the directors of these programs asking if they know of any local angel investment groups. \n\nJoin business plan competitions.

"Some good responses here to a very good question. This is just what I needed a dose of on January 1st.\n\nOut of curiosity OP, where are you located?"
"Question for you, when you say you are reaching for more challenging projects, are you saying they are just more complex or they are areas you just aren't as familiar with?  \n\nIf your answer above is #1, it sounds like the first thing you need to do is up your fixed bid rates.  I know it's always tempting to low-ball rates and estimates to generate clients, but there is now a whole sub-culture of people, just like agencies, who are so eager to get biz, they basically low-ball themselves out of being able to pay the bills.  Companies see people like this and use and abuse them to no end.\n\nThat assumption people have that they can land a client with a cheap rate/bid then up it in the future?  It will never happen.  If anything, clients will use leverage in the future to further drive rates and bids down.\n\nIf your answer to the question above is #2 (doing stuff outside your true core competency) then you might want to pull back from that, as clients often don't like to pay for freelancer 'training on the job' and they can tend to sniff that out pretty quickly.  Just hearing some of your clients aren't too chipper with you right now, just wanted to make sure you hadn't gone too far outside your comfort zone (as compared to giving them too little attention).\n\nFrom what I'm hearing, sounds like your projects are rather small in size/scope…..ever considered switching up to hourly?  That's often a lot more flexible from both sides.  Or instead of a fixed bid, how about a fixed bid range?\n\nGood luck, sounds like you have done a lot of thinking into this, hope you can come to the right answer!"
"&gt; probably\n\nKey word there \"probably\".  Have you checked?  Have you sold yourself as more than a 'developer'?  You're doing that with clients already.  You're handling billing, scoping/estimating, testing, delivery, support, sales as well as development right now.  Someone who has experience doing that is *generally* more valuable to a company/team than someone who doesn't. \n\nMany developers really are just developers - they shouldn't be allowed to talk to clients directly, and perhaps not even other departments.  You've got enough social etiquette to be communicating with people from various walks of life (direct clients, etc).\n\nI suspect you have a much better grasp of the importance of deadlines (and the domino impact a missed one can have) than many developers I've worked with over the years.\n\nI also suspect you understand the importance of client communication (however painful it might be) moreso than someone who is just 'a developer'.\n\nThis isn't to denigrate people who are dedicated developers, but you've already worn far more hats and have more experiences that are all useful in delivering web/software projects than many other people.  \n\nI also understand the desire/drive to work for yourself, but you're not - you're working for a family of 5, and their needs need to come before your own.  I bet your situation would look a lot different if you had $50k sitting in the bank.  I bet you'd make different decisions too."
"First off, let me say I feel the pain in your post. This is obviously a tough time for you. \n\nHere's where I would start. Breath. You are going to be fine.\n\nMy first priority would be renegotiating your current contracts. This will be difficult but you have to do it. Talk to your clients and just tell them where you are in this process. You need to have consistent income as a freelancer. And your clients HAVE to understand this. Negotiate from a standpoint of stability. Every business person understand this. \n\nIf they can not change the contract tell them you will need to hand the project off to another developer or hand them your code as is. If they threaten legal action I would just explain to them there's not a lot you can do. You have to feed your family.\n\nI imagine the majority of your contracts will either take the code as is or renegotiate. Be ready to walk away from contracts. \n\nIf you intend to keep freelancing, change your mindset to that of a consultant. You work and get paid for your expertise. \n\nStop doing fixed price projects. Bill for your time at the market rate ($125/hr in my area). \n\nIf I was in your shoes and had the stresses you have I would seriously consider a corporate job. Steady paycheck and benefits, as well as a likely reduction in workload and increase in family time would do wonders for your spirits. \n\nIf that's an option start looking today."
"another idea:\n\nHook up with a local media company (or two) that does good online marketing/SEO. See if they need dev help and would hire you as a contractor/company (not an employee). It can be a win win -  they get marketing contracts, you get steady but often not overly complex dev work. You won't get top dollar, but you should be able to negotiate a decent rate *if* you deliver fast and can help them communicate any tech details w/ the clients. The fast part is key. The sooner a site gets live the sooner they can start generating marketing dollars, which is often their main source of revenue.\n\nAs the relationship matures you can look at opportunities to build a simple SaaS app in partnership w/ the media company. Media companies often see common needs that they know would be very easy for them to sell. Among these ideas some could be achievable by a one man dev shop. You build and do advanced tech support, they sell and do basic tech support. They get more marketing dollars from each sale, you get more $/hour because you re-use more code thus do less work.\n\nIt's a balance and will need adjustments as you go along (e.g. adjusting price points for the service) so it's important the media company understands this and is flexible. Building the first version of a SaaS app, even a simple one, might take a while."
"To expand on your comment, in many cases \"milestone\" and \"deliverable\" are interchangeable, but one thing I found is that clients (usually older folk) tend to think \"deliverable\" is something they is in their possession.\n\nWhile I definitely had deliverables in that context, for payment purposes I used milestones so that I could get payment when they see a particular piece of functionality in the development environment.\n\nThis, of course, differs client to client."

By this I mean even if _jackrogue took a corporate job (closer to the 90k he needs vs the 70k he thinks he would get), it's not an eternal damnation of his skills as a freelancer.  It's a transitory thing, just like anything in this world.  He would do well to get a steady job, get 'back on his feet' with some savings in the bank, expand a network of potential clients, and start freelancing again a second time around in a couple years, with far more success due to lessons learned this time around and some savings to fall back on."

"You know what the problem is: cash flow.\n\nYou need to spread payment out. I have a couple of contractors that bill fortnightly. They therefore have great cash flow and our budgets are kept up to date too. Easy."
"couple things come to mind.\n\n1. Raise your rate.\n\n2. Give an estimate, ask for X% up front (25? 50? depends on size/scope), but bill hourly and set payment terms every X weeks (or milestones). Fixed prices can screw you on bigger projects because shit goes wrong, clients feature creep, it's hard to estimate bigger stuff well. Lock-in a fair hourly rate and communicate with the client when things happen.\n\n3. Reduce expenses if you can. Start saving as much as possible, there is definitely an emotional component where having a cushion helps. The two ways to have more money is earn more and spend less. You can work on both."
"If you aren't making enough money to last through to the next milestone (whether that's 50/50 or 50/25/25 or whatever), then you're either not charging enough (this is probably true regardless) or you're not being productive enough. Without knowing your financial situation it's hard to tell."
"Might want to take a look at odesk.com, elance.com, freelancer.com."
"Why not bill hourly?\n\nI have been contracting/consulting for years, and have never had a problem billing hourly.  I had one project I took at a flat rate; it was a disaster because the scope got out of control super fast.\n\nAlbeit I end up turning down 80% of the projects that come up, and its forced me to learn new skills/take projects because I like the pay, not the project."

There are many quality web designers and graphic artists in Asia or Eastern Europe that can will happily on these mundane tasks for you while you concentrate on the big picture of the business. They charge a fraction of what Americans charge and for the same quality of work. You will, of course, be managing the project and the direction/design of the web sites but you will free up your mind and body for the more interesting (and important) parts of running your business.\n\nBottom line: You can't run your business when you're in the trenches.

"I have not tried it before so I cannot say much about it."
"No worries. Focusing on making customers happy should always be priority #1. That said, the data and happiness are not mutually exclusive.\n\nFor example, we were able to uncover through analytics the fact that our new customer experience was confusing, so we reworked it. Definitely recommend you check out KISSMetrics or Mixpanel. They have a lot of SaaS focused metrics baked in for things like lifetime value and cohort analysis, but more importantly they let you tag all of your product actions/button presses as events. So you could see for example if the cohort of new users exposed to a new feature you are testing respond positively and in the desired fashion without solely relying on interviews.\n\nSo in one sense, analytics can very much be a tool to increase customer/trial user happiness while unlocking deeper product insights that you could not have obtained otherwise.

Products are infinitely more scalable than services. Typically much higher margin too."
"Sounds like you need to consider a full time position, especially if you have a family of 5 to support. \n\nAs for fixed rate projects, are clients feature creeping on you? You need to lay down a set of requirements in writing at the beginning of the project, and you need to bill additional costs if they start trying to change things or add things. If you have that under control, then you just need to be better about your estimates for time commitment. "

Make sure your prices are set correctly and maybe get someone to take on all the smaller projects you find to make a few extra dollars while you work on the important ones.

"Consider value-provided pricing. The more you work, the faster you will be cranking out code. So billing by the hour doesn't seem like a long term solution.\n\nSay you build an application that could essentially replace a full-time employee. That's a valuable tool that would save hundreds of thousands of dollars over just a few year's time. But say it only takes you 100 hours at $75/hr. That's a steal for the employer. So you should feel comfortable charing much more for the VALUE you are providing.\n\nHere's an article that had me considering value-provided pricing as my method.\nhttp://www.taylordaughtry.com/blog/the-essential-guide-to-pricing-web-design-services/\n\nI think that, combined with billing a percentage up front, and then invoicing at project milestones should help you out.\n\n"

"Howdy!  I want to congratulate you on accomplishing what most consider impossible....going on your own and taking care of your family.  This is no easy feat and you should give yourself some credit. \n\nLittle about me, going on my sixteenth year in the industry and what you are describing takes me back.  What I did was ultimately was come to these conclusions.\n\n1. What am I good at\n1. What are others good at.\n1. How do I create value for my clients.\n\nFirst off..you have a formula for success and are **able to close business**.  Forget the little guys that you described in your post.  This happens and we all take shortcuts in life from time to time.  Try to focus on the clients/projects that you like to have, and write down how, when and what you did to get those clients.  There is a pattern there and it can be repeated.  Refine and polish this methodology.  \n\n**Let go**\n\nControl is something that most of us want, but hate having.  As entrepreneurs we understand that creating value is essential to our survival however; what we \"perceive\" as value is totally different than what our clients \"perceive\" as value.  In other words, if I asked you to define the color blue, chances are that my definition of the color blue are going to be totally different.  **Define** the value that you bring to the table for your clients.  Value can be milestones for big projects that can be broken up into 1/4 - 1/4 -1/4 -1/4 instead of 50% to start 50% upon completion.  When you do a 1/4 by 1/4 process you build, refine and define the **value** that you bring to your client.\n\n**Get help and save time**  \n\nCreating a blueprint is much easier than building the house. A client understand a blueprint, and you can highlight the trouble areas so that the client is informed that \"this portion will cost more\".  Clients will respect you when you outline a detailed project.   Be the blueprint maker, not the general laborer.  If you want to have time to spend with your family (which is the most important thing)  you have to make time to alleviate what is taking up most of your time.  \n\n**Stop building and start managing.**  \n\nGet subcontractors and delegate.  Build value with them through the same process.  Step 1 gets you this, step 2 gets you this....and so on.\n\nOnce you get more time, you can focus on the side projects to sharpen your skills, grow, and learn.  This adds to the arsenal of value that you can bring to your clients.  Not to mention it gives you time to do what you love.\n\nIn closing, I tell all of my start up clients the following:   \"If you love baking, and want to open a bakery....the last thing that you will be doing, is baking.  You will be running a business.\"\n\n\nHope this help, and happy new year friend.  "

I would ask yourself, what do you (or could you) offer them that is worth 1$. "

"**1. Name / URL**  \n[chatleap](http://chatleap.com)  \n**2. What do you do?**  \nMaking an \"easy to explore\" chatroom system  \n**3. Are you looking for anything? (Feedback/Hiring/etc)**  \nFeedback would be cool! Also ideas to monetize."
"As a company (SongMeanings) that often hires freelancers, I love paying by milestones.  For us, it's an indirect way of keeping up to date with projects.  \n\nAs someone who does some freelance on the side, I invoice based on milestones.  It keeps me organized and reduces stress as I know I'll be getting paid based on X, then Y, then Z.  \n\nMilestones FTW."
"I am looking to a niche were I can speak to the owners more easily (so I am not looking to HR). I am currently looking into the wedding photographers niche. I've been interviewing quite a few for trying to discover their biggest pains."
"Excellent post!"
"You're in one of the highest demand fields around -- that's something you're absolutely blessed with. \n\nThis is what I'd recommend:\n\n1.) Working full-time as a web developer &amp; working part-time on your own startup until you are ready to launch.\n\n2.) Hike up your prices. What do you think you're really worth? \n\n3.) Hire another developer to help with the workload. Sure, you'll take a smaller cut, but projects will be completed much more quickly and you'll be able to expand your team further to take on more and more projects.\n\nBest of luck to you!"
"Well, Twitter's still trying to figure out how to monetize itself. \n\nSo... good luck."
"Sorry for the delay in responding! \n\nDefinitely some tough love from you, and I'd really like to go through some of your suggestions!\n\n&gt; \"BuckMeUp helps you earn what your customers think you're worth!\"\n&gt; fuck that title.\n&gt; people want to earn what they know they're worth, not what their random ass customers think they're worth (even if that's the idea, ease into it).\n\nOk - FYI; we've been A/B testing this to see what tagline captures what we do best, we're actually looking at a more buyer-focused tagline:\n\n\"BuckMeUp let's you find freelancers that deliver quality work, at the right price\"\n\n&gt; and the title needs to lead your prospects into sales copy explaining benefits and features further. not a link to a different page.\n \nWe tried this on our first launch of the site; putting the features right on the homepage led to a very high bounce rate; and if you look at similar sites (Fiverr, Microlancer, Odesk, Freelancer, Elance), most put the services right on the landing page because it reduces bounce rate. How would you present the features after the tag line? Would you put them where the carousel currently is? \n\n&gt; i've rarely ever seen landers with videos that helped. people don't have time for that shit. \n\nYeah, I guess neither Shopify nor Optimizely know what they're doing. And Dropbox must be doomed with their landing page videos. Despite your language, I agreed with many of your points up to here. Landing videos DO help when you need to educate users - which we definitely have to do.\n\n&gt; your copy is fucked anyway though.\n\nSuggestions? \n\n&gt; and don't use carousels. ever. i want to punch you.\n\nYour link about carousels was based on a UX study that asked people to look for a promotion. \nIt looks like ours [has a TON of engagement](http://puu.sh/65UNK.jpg); we just need to make it 'endless' and probably turn off the animation.\n\n&gt; have a solid value prop that can be fully conveyed. \nOur value prop is solid; buyers can find sellers motivated to overdeliver because their price is tied to their reviews. Sellers who do good work get paid more. \n\n&gt; and find a copywriter.\n\nWe're bootstrapped. Frankly, we can't afford one. I'm hoping that, through iteration and testing, we'll get to copy that works well.\n\nHappy New Year to you, and thanks for the feedback!"
"Thanks :-)\nCurious - was \"bacon_with_cause\" taken?"
"Be sure to share it when you're done; I'd love to see it! "
"\"bacon\" was taken. Figured I should instill the idea that bacon does not require a cause if I was forced to come up with something more creative than \"bacon.\"\n\nCrazy world we live in that we have to make life more complex than \"bacon,\" but it's reality."

"**Name / URL:** [mobiMicro](http://www.mobimicro.com)\n\n**What do you do?:** We're the first mobile product network. Advertising products from some of the top merchants in the world right into your favorite mobile apps through a beautiful user experience. Publishers can monetize their audience by driving revenue from qualified leads referred to a merchant site. Product listings are sold on a cost per click (CPC) basis to merchants. We share a portion of the revenue back with you on each qualified click that you drive back to a merchant site. \n\n**Are you looking for anything?:** I love hearing feedback from the community to make our company stronger. Our traction is on a strong upward trend as we just broke 2 million active users in a month and we serve about 15k products on a daily basis. I'd love to rapidly grow the company through advertising and sales force but for now we're continuing to grind, signing one publisher at a time. \n\nThanks! Looking forward to reading and meeting new people!"
"those are awesome!"

"Thanks.  I was on my tablet at the time so there was no save button.  Probably should have buried the reply in another reply though.  "
"I've heard that you should raise rates.  Many consultants/developers say raising rates worked great - making more money and oddly enough, making clients feel like they are getting more value.\n\nThink about it!"

"I know reddit/old digg/hacker news is as simple as it gets... I cant think of any other way that gets the user to actually interact and immediately see what is going on...\n\nYea as it is I am... I just pretty much exposed this early this year to get what people are thinking about it and did the same here to see what users of similar sites think about it. I also exposed it today on hackernews and hope to get some insight there as well\n\nThank you very much for your input chavolg..."
"Even with two technical co-founders (we're both developers), we're still following this strategy with [Lambda](http://getlambda.com?ref=reddit). With the exception of our homepage (which is a Jekyll site), we haven't written any code and don't have any immediate plans to start coding either. We've been able to bring in &gt;100k in sales in one month and expect to be able clear over a million next year.\n\nWe've discussed some ideas we could start developing, but in each case, we've always been able to come up with a quicker/cheaper way to test the relevant concept without development work. Sticking to a \"no code\" strategy has been a good way to focus our efforts on activities that actually matter. We both like to code and would probably be happier spending a week hacking instead of taking sales calls, but the latter is more important to our company right now.\n\nJust because you can write code doesn't mean you have to."
"In my opinion /r/startups and Hacker News seem to cater to different demographics. Hacker News tends to be more tech and science related rather than just startups. I just visited it and 8 out of the 30 front page articles are science/tech related, such as articles/posts related to programming languages or math. This is just my opinion, but I feel like  Hacker News has a more mature and more educated vibe. The top posts are generally very well thought out, well cited and very concise. A lot of Y Combinator guys hang out there, and we all know how tough it is to get selected. Basically, it has a pool of more intelligent/experienced folks. I enjoy both, but there are differences in the content and user base.\n\nAs far as blind leading the blind goes? I don't feel that way about Hacker News as much because of the content differences, as I described above. Here on /r/startups? Definitely, however, I think that's not necessarily a bad thing. I may not have 5 startups under my belt nor decades of experience, but I certainly have opinions on concepts from an end user point of view."
"I run [Lambda](http://getlambda.com?ref=reddit) which connects companies to a vetted pool of high-calibre, local developers. In fact, many of our freelancers are startup founders themselves who are looking to fund their own companies by working on some side projects with other startups. \n\nI suspect we'd be able to find you some developers that are a great fit for your project."
