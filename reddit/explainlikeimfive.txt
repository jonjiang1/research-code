"Like in all Legally binding contracts, parties from both sides ensure there are clauses that allow termination of said contract if certain requirements are met. If he does go to Texas, Texas will likely have to pay a large some of money and basically buy out his contract. Same thing with firing, however typically firing is done by a board vote, and it is typically written in the contract that the board(s) may vote that the coach is not producing, or maintaining a standard of excellence or performance. If its the latter, they can fire the coach and not have to pay him any extra money, unless the contract guarantees x amount of money over the term of the contract, and the coach has yet to been paid that amount of money."

"Penny auction sites charge you every time you make a bid.\n\nThese auctions don't work like eBay.  You can only increase the bid by a set amount (usually a few pennies), and the auction will be indefinitely extended until there are no bids in X minutes.  That means no sniping, and no bidding high and hoping for the best.\n\nSay an auction starts at $1 and ends at $37, but each bid only incremented 3 cents each time.  That's 1200 bids.  If each bid cost a quarter, that's $300.  If the item being sold only cost them $150, they made a profit of $300 + $37 - $150 = $187.\n\nMeanwhile, the person who won pays the $37 plus a quarter for every bid they made to get there.  They very likely end up paying $50 or $60.  And everybody else is out the money that it cost for them to make the bids."

"Same here.  There's a great reason people love sleeping under blankets, and it has more to do with pressure than warmth:\n\n&gt;\"In psychiatric care, weighted blankets are one of our most powerful tools for helping people who are anxious, upset, and possibly on the verge of losing control,\" says Karen Moore, OTR/L, an occupational therapist in Franconia, N.H. These special blankets are filled with weighted pellets, which are sewn into compartments to keep them evenly distributed. Weighted blankets are also sometimes marketed for general use as an aid to sleep and relaxation.\n&gt;\n&gt;\"These blankets work by providing input to the deep pressure touch receptors throughout the body,\" Moore says. \"Deep pressure touch helps the body relax. Like a firm hug, weighted blankets help us feel secure, grounded, and safe.\" Moore says this is the reason **many people like to sleep under a comforter even in summer**.  [Emphasis mine]\n\nSource: [Choosing a Blanket to Help You Sleep](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/minding-the-body/201112/choosing-blanket-help-you-sleep)\n\nI'm in my thirties and I still find a blanket to be one of life's simple, glorious pleasures, no matter the season.  Never had the pleasure of a weighted blanket, but I have a number made of cotton.  They're over six pounds (2.5+ kg) at queen size.  A flimsy, poly-whatever stuffed comforter or a thin cotton sheet just won't cut it; and a wool blanket is crafted for much colder climes than where I live.\n\nIf this rings a bell, the \"amazing\" effect of a hot shower / hot tub may be due in large part to its anti-anxiety effects described by a number of redditors in this thread.\n\nCheers for a great question!"

"One other thing to consider is that you're naked and that a wet body transfers heat much faster than a dry one (as does water compared to air). In a hot shower, you quickly feel getting warmer when hit by the water but when some part of your body is exposed to the air and is wet, you're quickly shedding that heat by having all that water evaporate off you. So while you are getting hot quicker, you're also shedding that heat quicker too. Also, you easily have the ability to control this by choosing the temperature of the water you're standing in and how much of your body you expose to it. You basically naturally balance the two to a point where they cancel each other out and you're left feeling the warmth of the water but not overheating."

But the rusting isn't generally a bit problem. The alloy they use for rails doesn't rust readily, and the rail is big and heavy, so a bit of the metal lost to rust doesn't matter for a long time. The structural steel of buildings is much thinner, and your fence would be made of steel that is, at most, 1 mm thick."

"Depends on the sport and the contract. \n\nMost managers and coaches have guaranteed contracts, meaning that if they signed for 5 years / $10 million, then the team the team is paying that manager / coach that $10 million, no matter what. So, when a coach is fired, they are still fulfilling their end of the contract (paying the money) but not allowing the coach to fulfill their end of the contract. \n\nSome contracts have buyouts where a has the option of retaining the services of the coach at the agreed upon price, or they can pay a flat fee to release themselves from the contract. \n\nWhen you have a coach who's currently under contract for a given team, their contract may have conditions by which the coach can leave the team. This is usually only in case the coach wishes to leave for a higher level job (such as a college coach getting a chance to be an NFL coach), or a higher paying job at a non-conference school (such as a Florida State coach going to USC or Texas). This allows a team to sign a coach without that coach feeling \"trapped\" by the job, and this not taking it.\n\nCoaches that are under contract are usually not permitted to interview for jobs that are below their current station, or with the same division (Jimbo Fisher would not be permitted to interview for a job at Auburn, for example). \n\nCoaches do have the option of resigning, which would result in them not getting paid for the rest of their contract, but the team has to agree to this. Teams usually do, since having a coach who doesn't want to be your coach is usually not good for a team's chances of winning. \n\n"

For example, last year the US government gave around $600,000,000 to Ethiopia, which amounts to about $6 a person. $6 isn't going to make a poor person not be poor anymore. It's only $6.\n\nMany people will bring up the corruption and bureaucracy that prevents aid from reaching the people, and that may be a valid reason not to donate more aid.

"Early petrol engines did run 'on fumes'. A small amount of fuel was put into a box, sometimes exhaust heat was used to warm the fuel up, and the vapors, or fumes, from that box was mixed in with the air being pulled into the cylinder. It was a fiddly, unreliable method that was quickly replaced.\n\nThe design of an engine's fuel system relies on a supply of liquid fuel.\n\n But there is a way, even in modern cars, that fumes are used. The fuel tank has to 'breathe', so it does not become pressurized. The gasses that are allowed out of the tank are passed through a charcoal canister that absorbs fuel vapors. When the car runs, some of the air the engine needs is pulled through this charcoal canister, where the vapors are released, and burned in the engine. It's nowhere near enough to run the engine, however."
"Diplomatic immunity and crime can be resolved in one of three ways:\n\n1. While the diplomat is not subject to his host nation's laws, he is subject to his own country's laws. So his own country can charge him with whatever crime(s) he's committed. \n2. A host nation can declare a specific diplomat \"persona non grata,\" meaning that they are no longer welcome in the country. If the diplomat declared such remains in the host country, he risks having his status revoked and he become subject to local law.\n3. The immunity is granted to the nation, not the individual diplomat. A country may choose to waive a diplomat's immunity, making that diplomat subject to local law."

"I'm going to piggyback on this to explain further.  The chessboard analogy is a good one, but it doesn't explain *why* after 100 moves you might want to get back to the start position.\n\nOne of the most common issues with software is a \"deadlock.\"  To understand a deadlock you need to understand that software is very stupid, in that \"robot who follows instructions to the letter without awareness\" kind of way.  So let's say I write some software that demands exclusive access to the camera, and then exclusive access to the microphone.  Meanwhile someone else writes software that demands exclusive access to the microphone, and then the camera.\n\nIf those start up at the same time, my software might get access to the camera, and then exist in this perpetual state where it keeps waiting to get access to the microphone.  Meanwhile, the other software is waiting on me for the camera.  This is a perpetual state of \"no you go first\".  The software sounds like a selfish child (or a member of congress) but it's really the consequence of following things to the letter.\n\nThe only possible solution is to shut down the two bits of offending software completely, and start one up.\n\nThere are many MANY resources available on a machine.  Limited memory, limited access to hard disk space, etc.  Even things that look like \"one program\" can in fact be many programs running together at the same time.  For example a video game might have one piece of software which controls the AI and another one which controls the physics.  So you can even have two bits of software fighting over a third resource which isn't a physical thing, just a digital character.\n\nWith thousands of little programs running at once, all of them demanding different things in dead-simple ways, it can be very easy for one or many programs to interlock in a complex way.  A stalemate, to use the chess analogy from the above poster, where no one can act.\n\nYou CAN just kill the offending software, but you have to know what the software is, and sometimes the bugs are subtle.  In older operating systems, its possible for one program (like, say, MS Word) to actually write into the data of another program (Solitaire) and cause it to crash, so the symptom shows up completely removed from the cause.\n\nThis is why starting EVERYTHING over is the fastest solution.  Sure you're restarting 98 good processes to kill 2 bad ones, but that takes less time than hunting down the bad ones."

"Why are there so many currencies that are so small in absolute value, such as the Yen and the Lira - is that what you are asking? If so, it is because most countries have, in the past, gone through severe financial problems that caused their currencies to greatly devalue. Some countries attempt to 'revalue' their currency by issuing new notes and declaring \"1000 old-note dollars is worth 1 new-note dollars\" - and this works only if the country has already fixed the problem that caused the currency to devalue in the first place.\n\nOr are you asking why the US dollar has such an important place in the world economy? Simply because the US economy is large, it has an open policy when it comes to use of their currency - China's currency, for instance, is strictly controlled, so its use is limited; and the US government is stable, so people have faith in its currency. It also feeds on itself - everyone uses the dollar for international trade, so everyone new that comes along starts using it as well. It does cause a problem for the US - other countries manipulate their currencies to adjust their economies, but, if the US government manipulates their currency, they are adjusting the entire global economy!"

"People with poor insurance or company care deserve government provided healthcare. I was simply providing reasons as to why many Americans are against the system. \n\nBy the way not every insurance company is like that. Some plans are and some aren't. The problem comes when companies drop support of their healthcare to increase profits. People get dropped back towards a system that might be inferior, and that's worrisome especially to families. Laws that prevent companies from dropping support of their healthcare would be ideal, unless given permission by a court.\n\nAnd then of course it is our government running it. They can't do anything correct, why should I trust them in giving me healthcare? What happens if a future president gets rid of the affordable care act? Then you're screwed, especially if you can't pay for it on your own. So now healthcare you had from a company, is taken away because of free healthcare being provided, which is then taken away because of politics."

Not a bad deal, a $800 iPad for $100... but because there were 1000 bids on the item, the auctioneer made $1000 on the transaction. The others who bid on the item spent a total of $900 on nothing."

"If you pet a service dog while it is working especially without permission from the owner, you are distracting the animal from it's trained duty. In those few seconds you are petting the animal, the dog could miss a cue the handler is giving such as blood sugar dropping. Without that alert from the dog, the person can go into shock, collapse on the floor, hit their head or become injured in another way in addition to fighting for their life because they could not get to their medicine in time because the dog was too distracted to alert to the impending medical issue. \nThis goes for all types of service dogs. It may not look like a dog is working if it is taking a nap under a table, but you have no idea what that dog is actually there for. A person may not look disabled and doesn't appear to need a service dog but there are may types of these animals and they can help in various ways. \nLet's take a look at some other examples: \nGuide dogs- distracting these dogs may cause a handler to trip, fall or walk into something because the dog was not being that person's eyes. \nMobility dogs- some people use large dogs to help them walk, similar to a cane but not putting nearly as much pressure on them. If you distract the animal, the handler will be jerked around and end up on the floor, possibly injured because you essentially pulled their cane out from under them. \nThere are many other examples but I think that sums it up quite nicely. Although I must say that sometimes you CAN pet a service dog. Just ASK the person. If you are nice about it, sometimes they will say yes, sometimes they will say no. If they say no, just drop it, wish them a good day and move on. Always talk to the person first, ignore the dog and don't bother a team just because you want to pet the animal. These teams have lives to live just like you, don't stalk the team just so you can pet the dog and ask 20 questions. "

"[I like this explanation:](http://www.popehat.com/2009/08/28/yes-there-are-some-people-i-would-not-defend/)\n\n&gt;I don't defend people because I support, or approve of, or like their conduct — or when I do, it's purely coincidental. Often I despise what they have been accused of — which is quite often something within shouting distance of what they actually did. But that has nothing to do with why I defend them. I do it because I believe firmly that the system works best (not perfectly, but optimally) when everyone accused by the state gets someone in their corner fighting for them — not because they are likable, not because in any objective sense that they deserve support, but because our society believes that the irreducible quality of being a human being is that when the government tries to stick you in a cage, we will give you one person who is on your side and doing their best to keep you out if the rule of law allows it. It's quasi-religious for me, or at least there is a religious parallel. I believe that I am loved, and forgiven, entirely by grace, not because I deserve it in any remotely convincing way. I could accuse me of such things, and so on. I think we come closest to grace when we provide an advocate to people without reference to whether they deserve it.\n\n"

"A tonsillectomy comes with a number of risks, and despite seeming simple it is actually a pretty serious surgery because of the tonsils' proximity to a number of blood vessels/arteries in the throat. The most common complications of the surgery are pain, nausea, vomiting, and bleeding. The risk of bleeding is especially noteworthy because it can be very sudden and very heavy. You can pretty much bleed out within a couple minutes, which is probably what happened in this case. I had my tonsils out last year and my surgeon repeatedly warned me and my parents about this, and told me not to eat anything red for at least a week so that we would be able to tell whether I was bleeding or not. \n\nThe other aspect of this case is that she also had an adenoidectomy done at the same time, which increases the risks of the surgery significantly. \n\n[This link](http://www.jfponline.com/home/article/dont-overlook-the-complications-of-tonsillectomy/5bdd8d2342483656db9cca2e171d3ff3.html) does a really good job of explaining the risks and statistics of this type of surgery.

AMD is in fact usually cheaper, however, they have a less efficient ISA resulting in Intel ISAs preforming a task approximately 20% faster as Intel's cores can handle instructions better.  I personally rely on Intel and have friends that swear upon both AMD processors as well as Intel processors and either would do fine for basic gaming, computer operations, etc. If you plan on overclocking your CPU I would suggesting going with an Intel Processors they are more efficient and, in my opinion, easier to Overclock."

"Explanation is simple.\nHot tub and warm day is not the same.\nWarm day makes your body to become hot. You are just whole hot and body tries to get rid of that energy by warming Your skin even more and tries to make some sweat to dissipate that internal and external energy.\n\nWhen You go into the tub in \"normal\" day You are not as warm. Your internal temperature is still 36,6 celsius but your hands, legs and skin is significantly colder.\n\nAnd when that cold body goes into hot tub it feels nice because your body gets hot. Just after You get into water that water starts to cool quite rapidly and you dont feel it as too hot. When you try to keep that water hot and wait 10-20 minutes in it it starts to be annoying and usually You will not want to stay in that for long."

Since agriculture is the basis for pretty much all of society (historically), the yearly repetition of the growing/harvest seasons has great importance."

I haven't had a bad anxiety attack in years but I found that after calling a close family member and another couple of times calling a close friend and crying and talking (while I was having them) that they went away.  I was kind of emotionally repressed growing up and tended to stuff things and I think it came out as anxiety.  When I began letting go of things and letting people know what was going on for me (in groups like AA, group therapy and counseling, etc...) the anxiety I was having diminished a lot. "

"Because corporations can do many things a person can do: They can enter into legal contracts, borrow money, lend money, invest, sue, be sued, and contribute to political and social campaigns. The pros to being incorporated are that it allows for entrepreneurs, and businesses to take risks, and not be sued personally. Which could result in a person going bankrupt. The cons are: Companies can engage in nefarious, and unethical business behaviors, without the decision makers who are responsible for the firm engaging in this type of unlawful behavior from actually being placed in jailed. On top of that, in the wake of the Citizens United case of 2010, corporations can now directly influence political campaigns by giving an unlimited amount of money to a candidate. If the candidate does not play ball with their desired objectives, they will just go ahead and give the money to a competitor who will, and they will end up with a good chance of winning. The collusion between industry, and the public officials that are suppose to be regulating, is often times what creates less than ideal results for the populace. There is documentary called \"the Corporation\". Check it out. It is very factual, and paints an objective picture of how corporations are a necessary part of the economy, but that must be kept in check because some engage in blatant illegal behaviors."
"The dollar is a unit of currency. It can be represented by a piece of cotton dyed green with the proper insignia and lettering on it, or electronically.

Or, it will sell Treasury bonds to the big banks in order to take money out of the market. It's a way of influencing the economy without having outright control over it.\n\nThe US government can make as many dollars as it wants, but each dollar made decreases the value of all the dollars, as a whole; this is inflation.\n\nThe dollar has value because we all agree it has value. I will accept it as payment for goods and services, and so will the gas station attendant, the landlord, the tax man, and the supermarket cashier. We all agree that the dollar means something, so it does."

"This story is on snopes as false. For like 5 years.\n\nRemember what the guy up above said about parrot? That's why. Feeble minds out number the quick witted. "
"[GrehBahm's answer](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1u4kl9/eli5_why_millions_of_dollars_is_donated_to_third/ceeglgy) gives a critical bit of perspective.  Millions of dollars isn't all that much money when you're talking about countries with hundreds of thousands or millions of people.\n\nWhat I would add is this: what's the most important difference between rich and poor countries?  That people in rich countries sell things or services that people will pay good money for, all the time.  For a poor country to exit poverty, it has to start doing the same.  But poor countries have a lot of obstacles to doing this, for example:\n\n1. Not enough of the population has the education or skills needed.\n2. If the country has inefficient or poor agriculture, most of the labor goes toward producing the food needed to survive, and no more than that.  This means that not enough people in the country have time to learn or train to do other things that might improve the economy.\n3. Lack of social trust.  For a society to build complex, valuable things, it requires a degree of trust between the people in it.  For example, if people can't trust the bankers not to steal the deposits, the bank won't get money; if the bank doesn't have money, then it can't make loans; if the bank can't make loans, then a lot of people won't be able to start businesses they otherwise could.  If the police takes bribes and protects bandits who steal valuable equipment, then nobody will want to start a factory, software company or anything like that.\n4. Lack of infrastructure.  For example, factories require power plants, transmission lines, transportation (rail, road, plane), communications (telephone, Internet).  Software companies require high-speed Internet connections.  Retailers require mass media to advertise their products.  Etc.\n\nAll of these are very difficult problems, and they don't magically go away because you throw money at a poor country."

One common critique is that since it is a privately owned business, it should be subject to the same openness that other business have to go through. Especially since it directly changes how much money is worth and impacting or lives in possible the most significant way. However, for some reason, they do not get audited and we know very little of their practices and policies.\n\nYou would think that an establishment that creates our money would be run by the government, but it is in the hands of a select few people.\n"

"The United States is finely balanced between two blocs of voters:  People who want to use wealth redistribution schemes to level the economic landscape, and people who are ok with the idea that there are people on the extreme high and extreme low ends of the economic spectrum.\n\nThrough a quirk in the way our politics developed there is a sizeable group of voters who SHOULD be in the wealth redistribution bloc based on their household incomes and their needs, but who ARE in the winners &amp; losers bloc.  This quirk has troubled political observers for 50 years.  It is primarily due to the fact that there are a lot of poor evangelical Christians in the United States that care more about abortion than their personal household checkbooks.  Strange, but true.\n\nTo keep the government from creating a European-style national health system the forces that don't want one have boxed single-payer healthcare into the idea of \"Socialism\", and have defined \"Socialism\" as Anti-American.  They have spent 100 years telling anyone who will listen that the outcome of a single-payer healthcare system will be a reduced quality of care, rationing of healthcare services, and a lack of choice about who your doctor will be or what treatments you can receive.  They are effective with this line of argument because it is all true - every national health service in Europe, Canada and Japan does these things.  There's no effective advocate for the other side of that argument, that helathcare costs have spiraled out of control because of the unique economics of healthcare (you'll pay anything to stay alive), and that universal care, even if rationed, is better for society than having 20% of the population live in fear of getting sick, and with healthcare costs triggering bankruptcies for many households where someone suffers a catastrophic illness like cancer or chronic heart disease.\n\nIn the last Presidential election, 52% of the voters picked the candidate that represents the wealth distribution bloc, and 47% picked the candidate that represents the winners &amp; losers bloc.  But it was just 8 years ago that the election went the other way, and there's good reason to think that it's a tossup now based on candidate personalities and campaign discipline who will become President.  Due to our strange Electoral College system who becomes President is now determined by a sliver of voters (less than 300,000 out of 330,000,000 residents) in 5 states:  Ohio, Florida, Virginia, New Mexico and Nevada.  With elections decided on these kinds of slim margins, there's an all out war to fight for a few voters who may change from Republican to Democrat in any given election.\n\nThe theory is that if enough new people are enrolled in some kind of new government mandated insurance plan, a batch of these \"swing voters\" will be captured by the value of the plan - once they have it, they'll never give it up (see: Social Security).  Those voters will forever after vote Democratic to protect that healthcare insurance, effectively locking in Democratic Presidents barring a personal meltdown or a major event like a war or another 9/11.\n\nSo the Republicans and their operatives are fighting with everything in their power to convince people to kill healthcare expansion before the lock-in occurs.  Worse, they're worried that once there's a lock-in, it will enable the Democrats to go for a full-scale single-payer national healthcare system: a system they cannot get with the current divisions in the electorate (which is why we didn't get one in 2008 even though there was a Democratic House, a Democratic Supermajority in the Senate and a Democrat in the White House).\n\nFor the GOP, this is literally a life or death struggle.  If they lose, there's a non-zero chance the Republican Party will become so marginalized that it will break apart (which is how the Republican Party was born in the first place; when the Whig party tore itself apart over the issue of slavery in the 1850s)"

"I'm going to expand this answer quickly.\n\nFirst you have to understand that for the most part,  addiction council services are ineffective for a large portion of the population. So for example the Cochrane systematic review, reviewed the effectiveness of AA on over 3,417 individuals and they could not conclude that it was effective at stopping alcoholism. Alcohol is a much less addictive drug then say heroine so it's difficult to get people to stop doing drug period. Most of the time it's an individuals own choice.\n\nTwo you have to understand the on going cost of a diseased individual. The cost of a Hep-C treatment is 48,000-70,000. The cost of HIV antivirals it $24,000 to $60,000 a year. \nThe cost of syringe is less the a dollar.\n\nThird you have to understand that people are not informed of their option. If a person wants to say Detox, having made the choice to get off drugs, there are multiple government program to help that individual, as well as work programs so he can get a job and housing at which point they start paying taxes, and stop abusing the system.\n\nSafe injection sites aren't meant to make people want to use drugs less, they are made to make sure they don't get sick (And cost the Tax Payer money.) and give them the ability to get help to quit. All of these programs lowering the crime rate, and thus the long term cost of the individual to society.\n\nIf there was a way to get people off of drugs that was effective then arguably speaking it would be more effective then safe injection site. There current is not one. "

They get a possibly (most likely) inferior plan as it is \"free\" and issued by the government, and still have to pay out of pocket, more so than with their previous company benefits. \n\nAnd you failed to counter my point as to what happens to people on free healthcare when some right wing idiot takes office and repeals the affordable care act?\n\nObviously having corporate greed running healthcare is stupid.

"Also, it's no where near adequate. \n\nLets just look at one country for a moment. \n\nEthiopia.  Per capita GDP  (nominal not PPP) - 513 dollars a year, total GDP ~50 billion USD a year.  Population 91 million.   (on purchasing parity they are at 100 billion USD a year). \n\nAs compared to say, Germany, population, about 82 million, per capita GDP 43000 per year, total GDP about 3500 billion.  \n\nSo... to get Ethiopia to to level of germany needs 3450 billion dollars a year.  That would be the entire US federal  government budget roughly (~3800 billion).   The US, combined public and private only gives about 70 billion dollars in air total per year, and a lot of that is military aid, europe combined is about on par.  So even if the US and europe teamed up to just fund Ethiopia, and ignored everyone else, ethiopia would still be somewhere around 1/20th the wealth of the US per capita.  \n\nNow obviously the expectation is that a country would  produce most of that value on its own.  Aid is to cope with  disasters and to  help fund the development of infrastructure etc. \n\nBut it is a VERY very very very very long  way to go from where  many of these countries were in the 1950's or 1960's to somewhere reasonably well off.  India had a literacy rate of 11% in  1947, it's 74% today.  Most of europe and the US have had  literacy rates of &gt;90% for a century (in some cases 2 centuries).  They were looted and repressed by empires, torn apart by strife for decades in many cases, and \n\nSince 1970 china has been growing at a breakneck pace - this is because they took aid money they were given (in part by the US) invested it well, made serious legal reforms to make  the country attractive to foreign investment.  That's  really the only reasonable model.  But it takes decades for good policy to take hold, and if you cannot keep the political situation under control, say with  coups, religious strife, or just a constant parade of new plans then you never get anywhere.  \n\nI know it's an odd analogy but it's a bit like NASA.  If every major  project you have takes  10 years to complete, but every 8 years someone new takes over and throws out whatever you were working on  then you end up seeming like you've accomplished relatively little because almost nothing ever  gets finished.  \n\nYou can't build schools if you have no teachers, you cannot get teachers if you have no roads and money, you cannot get roads unless you have people who would use them and vehicles to drive on them, you cannot get money to buy vehicles unless you have something to trade, and you cannot have something to trade unless you have something people  want to buy, and you can't make anything people want to buy if you have an illiterate population just trying to scrape by.  Either you need to get  lucky and find something in the ground that is tremendously valuable, and then not squander the wealth, or you need massive investment for the sake of it, and that needs to go on for years.  \n"

Intel cpu's clock for clock are much more efficient - this is called the microarchitecture, and it's the implementation of the ISA.  A few years ago AMD briefly almost caught up to Intel, but Intel  has much better fabrication processes than anyone else in the business, so even running identical microarchitectures Intel can use less power for the same thing. \n\n\n&gt;they are more efficient\n\nefficient is an odd metric.  Definitely intel processors are more efficient in terms  of performance per watt for synthetic loads.

It's not that walking around your house versus being in the shower naked are necessarily any different in terms of what should be  considered private, but technology has changed so  we need a constant debate about what you can do now.

"There is an experiment that you can do that proves this effect. \n\nTake two cups. Place one in the microwave for a minute or two. The water should be warm, but not so hot you can't touch it.

Leave them in for about a minute. After the time has passed, take them out and place them near each other on the table. The hand that was in the warm water should think that the table is colder than the ice water hand thinks it is."

"Good answer. Let's not forget that wet skin loses heat much more quickly than dry skin, and so when you are in the shower/tub, the parts of your skin that are exposed to the air loses heat which keeps your temperature stable. For this reason, if you were to submerge yourself completely in hot water, you could overheat extremely quickly."
"Yeah, depends who made the bomb.  During WW2, for example, the Germans used things like sea mines which had lots of false triggers and fail deadly thingamajigs in them.  Sometimes they'd explode while the bomb disposal guy was turning a screw to open up the device.  Don't see that in the movies.  \n\nSome idiot making a bomb in his backyard shed though probably isn't that advanced in bomb making."

Cutting the power to the electromagnet would then drop the item, which could start a signal."

"It is very possible (and not difficult) to build a \"collapsing circuit\" that can detect when the circuit is tampered with, and respond to any changes (by, for example, detonating a bomb). A clever circuit design will try to obfuscate the purpose of any individual component so that it is difficult to discern which components aren't booby-trapped. "

"Food and air go to two separate places. Food to your stomach, air to your lungs. Past your throat, they are in separate tubes. You cannot inhale food, in fact you probably just heard a common saying, meaning someone ate very quickly.\n\nSome drugs, however, can be inhaled, and this works when the lining of the lungs absorbs that drug into the bloodstream. You can also swallow air, and in case the food and air is not separated, which means the air has to eventually escape your body either up top or down bottom."
"Different soaps may also do different things. Soaps for extra sensitive skin, shampoos for dandruff, liquid face cleansers with acne treatments, stuff like that. "
"Warmer air can contain more moisture than colder air.  For example, if you could take a mass of cool air at 100% relative humidity and heat it up, the relative humidity of that same mass of air would drop to, say, 50%.  This is why fog tends to \"burn off\" by late morning, the same mass of air (more or less) increases in temperature by 10-20 degrees Fahrenheit due to warming by the sun.  So a mass of air that had visible droplets of water in it at 7 AM will become transparent by 11 AM."

You could be an American vacationing here, and you're covered in an accident/heart attack/whatever.  There isn't really a thing such as \"job with benefits\" because everybody is entitled to that benefit.  I'm 100% convinced US is basically a \"3rd world country\" with more money involved.\n\nEDIT: and you know what?!

"Disclaimer:  Lots of people are going to give you different answers, I doubt there's a single objective answer to this.  So lets preface this comment with a big “*IMHO*”.\n\n#1 - You need a clear &amp; consistent message for these kinds of things, but their willful decision to not have basic leadership made that impossible.  What began as a response to corporate greed and wall street's excesses eventually had other political interests injected into it (environmentalism, war issues, basically anything people wanted to write on a sign and bring to the protests).  There's a  reason why we have idioms like “*too many cooks spoil the broth*”. Movements need cohesion, and OWS didn't have any after a certain point.  They sacrificed strong leadership for some egalitarian'ish approach that did nothing but make them feel better about themselves.\n\n#2 - The other major problem was they didn't bother to interact strongly with the political system.  They made the mistake of ONLY protesting in the streets.  You really do need to lobby your congressmen, send leaders of your movement (which they lacked) onto news shows for interviews with clear &amp; concise messages.  You need to figure out which existing politicians you can label pro-OWS or anti-OWS.  But most of all… you need leaders/representatives of OWS to tell people specially what laws you want made or repealed.  Put a big target on laws you like/dislike, to draw attention to them.  OWS should have been on TV advocating specifics like “*We need McCain-Feingold strengthened*” or “*We need campaign finance reform*”.  You need to point at the solution, not just point at the problem.  You'll notice that those are all things the Tea Party did.  And that's why they lasted longer.\n\n#3 -  They needed to connect with the general public (at least sympathetically if nothing else), but instead they did stupid shit the human-megaphone and waving their fingers up/down to indicate silent agreement/disagreement.  That's not something your normal middle-class voter is interested in seeing.  That shit looks weird, and thus delegitimizes one's self as being a credible advocate of political policy.  Showing up in shitty outfits like [this](http://www.politifake.org/image/political/1110/ows-protesters-ows-politics-1318756399.jpg), or [this](http://rt.com/files/news/occupy-protest-revival-arrests-569/ows-protesters-demonstrate-bryant.jpg) rather than [work-clothes or your sunday best](http://lcweb2.loc.gov/service/pnp/ppmsca/03100/03128r.jpg) sure didn't do them any favors either.  You will have political opponents trying to delegitimize you, and you just hand them ammunition like that, really?!

The sounds for 'sh' and 'ch' (aka 't + sh') don't have single letters either.   Have you noticed inconsistencies in pronunciation of words like bear vs tear, too?  English spelling tends to stay constant.\n\nThere really hasn't been any spelling reform (French and German have had them, for example), and there really isn't any body like the Académie Française to carry out one.  Spelling reforms that have been attempted (look them up on wikipedia for details) have largely been ineffective in English.  Schoolteachers have largely reinforced the odd spellings and they've simply continued over the years.  Newspapers print the same spellings they always have because they don't dare spell something wrong.\n\nBasically, there's no strong enough force to make it change, and any one attempting on their own would just be labelled wrong, like someone on the internet saying \"u r\" for \"you are\".

"I get those all the times but if I follow my train of thought backwards for a bit I can usually find the trigger thought that led to it. A lot of times though it's not an actual \"thought\" that triggered the memory but an emotion. Like I'm remembering one event, I get a feeling from that memory like the feeling of safety when your surrounded by loved ones or a certain specific type of awkwardness in a strange scenario, and it triggers a memory in which i had a very similar feeling even though the situations can be extremely different and unrelated and therfore not a very obvious \"trigger memory\". \n\nSometimes the trigger can be so damn small it's easy to miss that it was the trigger at all, like say I'm remembering a birthday party, and then there's a scene where I'm in a car after the party and look out the window for a split second and the feeling of vastness that the nature outside instills triggers a memory of me camping in the Rocky Mountains, which doesn't seem to be related to the birthday party memory at all at first glance.

"This is rather tough to answer purely because it relies on naming and arbitrary dates. First of all, it cannot be said that it is because January is the first month. That is like saying that the letter A is the first letter because of alphabetical order. January could have well been the second set of thirty days, or the third, or whatever. Similarly, there is nothing saying that B couldn't have originally been the first letter of the alphabet.\n\nReally though, the setting of a new year start date is pretty arbitrary. For a large portion of history in many areas, including Britain up to 1751, the new year started on the vernal equinox, in March. For other societies, it happened on the autumn equinox, or on one of the solstices. \n\nIt does make a little bit of sense that January would be placed as the first month.

If so, could you tell me how it's lost &gt;during the cloning process?\n\nTelomeres are shortened when they fuze the DNA with a donor egg due to the shock of electrical current. To be fair though telomeres are long on purpose for error correction in our DNA and this shortening seems to often correct itself by the time of birth when it works. \n\n&gt;2) Siberian tiger?

"Two words: kinetic energy."
"Wired had a nice article about it some time ago:\nhttp://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/09/ff-corning-gorilla-glass/all/\n\nAnd this quote is the best from it:\nThe interplay between compression and tension is best demonstrated by something called a Prince Rupert’s drop. Formed by dripping globs of molten glass into ice water, the quickly cooled and compressed heads of these tadpole-shaped droplets can withstand massive amounts of punishment, including repeated hammer blows. The thin glass at the end of the tail is more vulnerable, however, and if you break it the fracture will propagate through the drop at 2,000 miles per hour, releasing the inner tension. Violently. In some cases, a Prince Rupert’s drop can explode with such force that it will actually emit a flash of light.\n\nSo glass can be very strong, but at the same time very weak at a single point."

"You could say that dimension *x* looks like the shadow of dimension *x+1*... what you're basically saying there is let's cancel out one number line. Let me explain:\n\nStart with a number line, for measurement. This will let us measure in the first dimension. So we have a graph with one axis, and let's imagine that axis as being infinitesimally thin, but with infinite length. Like a really long piece of string viewed from far away. So now let's go up into the second dimension. To do that we just add a number line that is perpendicular to the first one. So when you move along the second number line, you're only moving on that line, not moving on the first line. \n\nNow let's go up into the third dimension. We need to add a number line just like before, and it needs to be perpendicular to the other two number lines. So how does that work? We have two lines for the second dimension, each one is at right angles to each other. So to add another line that is at right angles to *both* the x and y axes, we need to put it straight through the middle of the page. So now we have 3 lines, and when you move along any number line, you are only moving on that line, not on the other two lines.\n\nSo now we want to go up into the 4th dimension, but we can't see what that looks like. We can only see in three dimensions. But that doesn't really matter because 4 dimensional objects don't affect us. We will probably never be chased by a 4 dimensional space whale. So why do we care about the 4th dimension? Well in math it helps to see things in planes of complexity. For example, speed is distance/time, so we can say that if we can label the x-axis as distance and the y-axis as time, we can show speed as a 2D graph. Now we want to show acceleration, which is a relationship between *speed* and time. So speed is the second dimension, and time is the first dimension to show acceleration, and that means acceleration is the third dimension. So let's say we want to look at *jerk*, which is the rate of change of acceleration. So we look at acceleration vs time. So now we're above distance, we can't even see distance in our frame anymore because we're a whole dimension above it; the highest thing we see is the 4th dimension. But how do we see it? We just treat it as a 3D graph of any three dimensions which *include* the dimension you're dealing with, which allows you to visualize it."

"Whirlpools occur when the water has to travel sideways to get to the plug hole such as when the bath is mostly drained. The actual dynamics of a whirlpool are fascinatingly complex but really not worth going into in ELI5 so I will do my best with a simplified version.\n\nImagine you are a little packet of water, sitting in the back corner of the bathtub, minding your own business, surrounded by your friends and family. Suddenly they all start moving in one direction and, curious as to what is drawing their interest, you move with them. \n\nYou move slowly at first, picking up speed, you are water after all and quite slippery. Eventually you are travelling quite quickly when WOOSH! you zoom past that thing you wanted to see. Frustrated, you turn to have another go but you are going so fast, and it's hard to slow down. You are shoved from the side by your friend who got unlucky, he went top speed into the corner, you slow down a bit but turn, circling the thing, maybe you'll get another chance to see it!\n\nThis goes on for a while, going round and around and around, getting closer and closer to the front of the queue to see the thing. The guy in front of you grabs your hand, he's pulling you! You go faster and faster, in a panic you grab the hand of the guy behind and that's when you see the thing for the first time. The Maw, the Abyss, all your friends and family are tumbling into oblivion, pulling you and each other in with them.\n\nThe darkness beckons. The End.\n\nActual scientific answer: because you have a region of low pressure at the plug hole, the water accelerates as it approaches it. If it comes from the side it gets spun around the hole a few times before dropping away. This generates a whirlpool. The direction of the spin has nothing to do with the Coreolis effect (which does affect the spin of cyclones and hurricanes) and everything to do with the geometry and surface of the basin/bath. Basically it is a 50/50 whether your spin will be clockwise or anticlockwise, regardless of whether you are in the North or South.\n\n**TL;DR: whirlpools form because of low pressure around the plug hole and a relatively low water level, this causes the water to spin as it drops down the hole. The direction of their spin is pretty fixed for a particular hole, but will vary based on the shape and size of the basin/bath rather than any other reason**"

"Ok the rules should be about the same. Before you do this you should know that diy wiring is dangerous and it WILL invalidate any house insurance you have. Many electrical outfits will give you a free quote on the job and I would recommend at least looking into it.\n\nIf you still want to diy here is what you need to know:\n\n-You can't have more than 12 devices (light,plug,etc) on a circuit (breaker). \n\nYou can figure out how many things are on a circuit by turning off the breaker and counting what is off. If you can't find a suitable circuit to pull power from you will have to run a new one from your panel.\n\n-Any wire you run has to be \"mechanically protected\" if it is lower than 5 feet from the floor. If the wire is run inside a framed wall that's fine but otherwise it will need to be armored cable which is more expensive.\n\nMaking sure your wire can not be physically harmed is the most important thing you can do to ensure safety.\n\nThe type of wire you need is 14/2 NMD and 14/3 NMD. The 14 is the gauge or \"size\" of the wire. 14 gauge is suitable for a 15 amp circuit. The 2 and 3 refer to the number of conductors the wire has, not including the ground which every type of wire has. 2 conductor has a neutral and a hot and 3 conductor has a neutral and 2 hots.\n\nNMD stands for 'non metallic dry' which means that the wire has no metal armour and is only rated for dry locations. If you want to run wire outside or underground you need NMWU (non metallic wet underground) or ACWU (armoured cable wet underground)\n\nTo help you with the actual wiring I would need to know more about what you want to add and where. Feel free to message me or just reply in this thread.\n\n\n"

"I do agree that the human genome is a complex and unpredictable thing, that will lead to one of the things that make me not want to be on the \"Let's gene mod humanity!\" bandwagon: There will definetly be failures for the first ten, hundreds, and maybe even thousands of attempts, there will no doubt be trial and error, and I have no doubt people know this. In order for us to perfect the art of modifying ourselves to withstand some of the deadly parts of nature (or for other reasons) we will need to make a sacrifice of having a bunch of fuck ups that will affect those who volunteer for the first few attempts, we will need people to be affected negatively for us to finally gene mod someone and be able to say \"We did it right.\"\n\nI'm certain this is one of the reasons people are uncomfortable with the idea of genetic modification, because they don't want people to be affected because of the inevitable screw ups. All because our genetics aren't so welcome to being told how to change and being so hard to understand."

"&gt;f we were to get universal healthcare how much would it affect the cost of living in the U.S.?\n\nIt would cut it  by about 6%  of GDP.  The US spends 18% of GDP on healthcare for worse health outcomes than anyone else, and the second highest spenders are France and Switzerland who are around 12%.  The UK's NHS spends about 10% of GDP (The low end of the scale) and  still has better care than the US. \n\n&gt; I feel like having a more socialized gov't you get more security but like in america you have more potential and opportunity to make a lot of money.\n\nThere are super rich people in other countries too.  In the US you have the advantage of being in a highly populous rich country with one language.  \n\nAs hard as europe tries, it is not really one market yet.  You can't just make a product and sell it in english, you have to incur overhead for everyone else. \n\nBut the 3rd richest guy in the world is Spanish, the 9th and 10th are French, the 12th is swedish etc.  \n\nCertainly there are parts of europe that are quite a bit poorer than the US - that's not because they're socialist, it's because they've had bad policies, corrupt rules or particularly bad governments, including very recently.  The Euro is a disaster, but even if it wasn't, southern europe still has a lot of catching up to do to northern europe in terms  of productivity.  "

"Purely from a temperature standpoint, the [typical core temperature](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_body_temperature) is highest around 19:00 and lowest at 05:00.

I personally feel feverish while I'm falling asleep regardless of time so there might be something else at work too. Our skin can withstand a very wide temperature range and still feel ok, but our core temperature is very susceptible to minor changes: 32C is delirium and sleepiness, 35C is shivering and numbness, 37C is considered normal, 38C is sweating and general discomfort, 40C is vomiting and fainting."

"It basically comes down to a decision to reinvest the profit back into the company or pay a dividend.  Firms which pay a dividend typically keep doing so and firms which haven't make this decision every year.  \n\nThe value of the stock is based entirely on earnings both present and future and assets.  Whether or not they are reinvested is a secondary consideration albeit an important one.  The value of the stock is based on the expectation the firm will later issue dividends.\n\nAs a successful firm's earnings grow the earnings per share grow with it.  So for investors who bought in early they may receive dividend payments at a much more favorable P/E ratio than later investors even when taking into account the time value of money.  \n\nControversy can surround this decision, e.g. there are plenty of Apple shareholders who believe Apple should issue a large dividend to distribute profits which they believe exceed the firm's capital requirements.

"It depends completely on whether or not the home is in fact the fugitive's home.  If so the bounty hunter needs no permission to enter.  That can apply to a case where a fugitive has roommates because the fugitive already gave the bounty hunter permission to enter any property in which he legally resides.\n\nBut say if a fugitive's parents give him the legal right to stay in their home, and the fugitive gave the bounty hunter the legal right to come into whereever he legally resides, then it can get a little awkward.\n\nA bounty hunter may be able to enter if they have full knowledge of the fugitive being there, but that is taking a pretty big chance because they can be sued by the property owner's if they are wrong.\n\nIn such a case they will typically just remind the property owner that they are violating the law by knowingly harboring a fugitive.  If the bounty hunter has to call the police, there is a chance that the property owner can also be arrested and charged with a crime.\n\nSo in most cases the property owner will either allow the bounty hunter in, or tell the fugitive to get out.  It all depends on whether or not they want to go to jail also.\n\nThis will be a very shaky analogy, but works to some degree.  Say you see your child abducted by a man who runs into his friend's home.  You ask the friend to let you in to get your child, and he says no.  If you kick down the door and go in to retrieve your child, you aren't likely to face any legal problems because you had full knoweldge of a crime in commission and the home owner was willfully aiding a criminal so he's going to jail also.  But chances are that no criminal jury will convict you of a crime, and no civil jury will find you liable for damages, because the home owner was acting criminally.\n\nThe analogy falls down because while your child may be at immediate risk if abducted, a bail jumper typically poses no such immediate risk.  It's better to just let the police handle it and avoid a potential sea of legal trouble in that case.  No bounty hunter wants to be sued out of business."

"But what we can visualize is the movement of a 3d entity through spacetime. That is how I visualize the 4th dimension. In order for something to be in motion, it needs to have the 4th dimension, time, to be involved. To help understand this, we can define the 5th dimension. The 5th dimension is an object existing across the entire 4th dimension. For example, if a cube were to move along a set path, it would be that cube existing at all points along that path as one quantifiable entity. So we live the line between the 3rd and 4th dimension. We live in one moment, but we can also visualize the passage of time; we know that things will not be the same in the next moment, but we cannot possibly know exactly what will happen in the next moment. And this is where the 6th dimension comes into play, but that is a whole other thing to visualize. I'm a bit tipsy right now, so that may have not been worded in the best way, but I tried."

"It's not a bad comparison at all.  It is a 3% error rate that costs a lot of money.  Money is worry and sweat to most people.\n\nBut you missed the larger point.  The point is that a basic social safety net should neither encourage nor condone irresponsibility in any way.  The welfare surfer is actually not cheating the system in any way - he is operating completely within the rules.  The rules are just idiotic.\n\nWhile there may be only a 3% rate of outright fraud, there is a massive number of cases where free stuff just encourages people not to bother trying to care for themselves, or just free riding on a generous system while making money in the underground economy (technically fraud, but virtually unprovable and therefore not part of the statistics).\n\nI worked in the core of urban Milwaukee for several years and saw a lot of this.  At the time, in order to keep receiving unemployment benefits you had to actually have employers sign a paper stating you applied for a job.  People came in all the time and threw down their paper asking me to sign it.  The majority didn't ask for a job, they just asked to have their paper signed.  We occasionally screwed with people's minds by talking about needing someone to clean the warehouse.  Not a single one of them wanted to hear that.  They'd pick up their paper and walk out.  They didn't want a job, they wanted their full course of benefits first."

"The challenge is to enunciate a compelling option if the lock-in happens.  The New Deal locked in the House for 50 years.  If you're thinking about running for President, you only have about 5 elections when you're a legitimate candidate.  The party needs to move to a new value segment, peel off enough voters from the Democrats, and fight the civil war to redistribute money and influence.  It's hard to imagine how that unfolds quickly enough for the short attention spans of modern politicians.\n\nBy 2020, the cost of social security, Medicare, Medicaid, and the interest on the debt will equal tax receipts.  Thereafter, the costs accelerate and by 2050 we'll be borrowing $1 for every $1 in taxes just for those four things.\n\nThere will be nothing but either/or budget choices.  Every expense not one of those four things means a cut in something else. The GOP has to reorganize around that understanding."

"Ok, so this is what I posted in another comment to try and describe the 4th dimension.\n\nWe can visualize is the movement of a 3d entity through spacetime. That is how I visualize the 4th dimension. In order for something to be in motion, it needs to have the 4th dimension, time, involved. To help understand this, we can define the 5th dimension. The 5th dimension is an object existing across the entire 4th dimension. For example, if a cube were to move along a set path, it would be that cube existing at all points along that path as one quantifiable entity. So we live the line between the 3rd and 4th dimension. We live in one moment, but we can also visualize the passage of time; we know that things will not be the same in the next moment, but we cannot possibly know exactly what will happen in the next moment. And this is where the 6th dimension comes into play, but that is a whole other thing to visualize. If you want to think of it in terms of calculus, it is like taking the integral of your current reference frame. Its kind of an abstract thing to visualize, but I think this video will help a lot.\nhttp://youtu.be/8Q_GQqUg6Ts\n\nSorry for mobile link."

"In the early Roman Republic, the year began with the spring, in March (It still does in several other calenders). September was the seventh month and the leap day was added on the end of February, the last month. \n\nJulius Caesar introduced a new, solar-based calendar that was a vast improvement on the ancient Roman calendar, which was a lunar system that had experienced massive seasonal drift over the years (the seasons falling out of alignment with the months due to a poorly designed calender). The Julian calendar decreed that the new year would begin on January 1st. Caesar picked January because January 1st because the Roman civil year already began on that date. Before Caesar took power (and, for a time afterwards), the highest position in the Roman Republic was the consulship. Two consuls were chosen for one year terms, terms to begin on the first of January. This was a tradition that went back hundreds of years, and as a result, that is when the Roman civil year began.\n\nWe currently use the Gregorian calender, which updated the Julian calender with better measured leap years (for example, no leap years on multiples of 100, unless they are also divisible by 400) as well as changed the date to rectify seasonal drift that had occurred before the new leap year system.

"From wikipedia\n\nNew Year's Day is observed on January 1, the first day of the year on the modern Gregorian calendar as well as the Julian calendar used in the Roman Empire since 45 BC.[1] Romans originally dedicated New Year's Day to Janus, the god of gates, doors, and beginnings for whom the first month of the year (January) is named. Later, as a date in the Gregorian calendar of Christendom, New Year's Day liturgically marked the Feast of the Circumcision of Christ, and is still observed as such in the Anglican Church and Lutheran Church.[2][3] In present day, with most countries now using the Gregorian calendar as their de facto calendar, New Year's Day is probably the world's most celebrated public holiday, often observed with fireworks at the stroke of midnight as the new year starts in each time zone."

"1) Many veterans are disabled or suffer from crippling injuries or chronic problems such as pain (which can lead to drug addiction) and loss of mobility (even if many of them \"look healthy\"), disability benefits are generally not enough to live on, and their injuries can make holding down a job difficult.\n\n2) The VA hospital system are what we might charitably be described as \"awful\", especially in the area of treating psychological trauma of war like PTSD (not to mention the difficulty some people have in transitioning back to civilian life). People with PTSD and other mental illnesses would probably find it harder to find and hold down jobs, making it worse, many who suffer from mental illnesses turn to alcohol and drugs, which just makes the situation worse.\n\n3) Employers sometimes discriminate against soldiers, believing that they \"all\" are PTSD-ridden psychos just waiting to snap, and might not employ them. Also, for many people, skills learned in the army don't lead to high paying careers (especially if you fail to do much rank climbing).\n\n4) The stress of being a soldier (and the aftermath) can drive away loved ones and family members, which means that often soldiers don't have too many friends and family members to fall back on when the times get tough. Also many soldiers come from low income back grounds and sometimes even their family can't do much to help them.\n\n5) Also, maybe you just see a lot of homeless people who says they are veterans to garner sympathy (after all, accountants turned panhandlers generally don't advertise that fact)."

"there is two things, bandwidth and data. they are seperate.\nbandwidth is expensive, like seats on a plane. but data is cheap, like the storage part on said plane.\n\nwhy? because some data is free. texts literally cost nothing, they occur just from your phone being within range of a cell tower. and the amount of data which is sent in the handshaking * the rate they are sent * the time in the billing cycle is a limited amount of data. and that amount of data being used can just be presumed in the billing cycle.\nthe problem arrises when people going beyond that rate of data. it creates surges, bottle necks. there is more demand than they is capacity. the occur during peak times, and aren't often considered in design.\n\nif people were to have most of their file based data occur 'overnight' like a \"torrent\" with very little bandwidth. then cell networks could handle the data easier. but also if one was going to do something liek that they might just do it straight through wifi, or direct physical connection.\n\nnow to get straight on your questions. does it cost companies allot of money if you use more data? in a way yes. you have a cellphone and the cell company has leased part of the bandwidth of a cell tower. every time you access you phone through that tower, your cell company pays the owner of the tower for providing service. if you (john public) say that you will onely use a certain amount of data per month, and you go over it during peak times, then the tower owner may charge the cell company huge fees. those fees get passed on to you.\n\n&gt;Or is it a way they can get more money per gigabyte used?\nto charge more for data, they keep the limit the same but speed up the connection rate and the amount of content you could consume bandwidth through. they want you to hit the limit asap so they don't have to provide service to you as cheaply. this also helps alleviate peak hour concerns if they can get you to hit the peak during off hours. they do make up the fees they pass onto you, and charge you a fee for breach of contract if the behaviour if common place would bring exorbitant fees upon them. same reason they charge for roaming."

"There are different types of aid.  \"Humanitarian aid\" meets immediate needs in times of crisis/disaster/suffering.  \"Development assistance\" is a long-term endeavour that attempts to strengthen a poor country's ability to meet its own needs better.

"It depends. Outdoor dust is largely finely-ground or powderized soil; boulders become stones, which become gravel, which becomes dirt, which becomes dust. Usually moisture in the ground keeps this fine powder collected together as dirt. That's why extra water makes it mud and no water makes it dust.\n\nIndoor dust is the more disgusting stuff. It's largely flakes of dead skin cells, clothing fibers, hair, and other things that drop off of the inhabitants of the space. It also does include a bit of the outdoor dust as well. Usually, the more active a room is, the dustier it gets in a given amount of time. Ironically, the less active it is, it also gets dustier since the air is calmer and the particles can settle easier. That's why dust collects on higher surfaces in a room more than lower ones. Check your ceiling fan blades versus the top of an end table to see that in action."

"I don't know the legal definitions, and the information I was reading years ago, aside from being possibly *wrong*, was referring to squatting in the UK IIRC, not the US. So factoring that into it, I may be waaaay off. Thankfully, I've never had to put this information to the test. It is just fascinating trivia until proven wrong. \n\nThat said, the gist was that with a minimum of other requirements:\n\n* A person occupying a livable space (apartment, house/condo/duplex/hotel/etc)\n\n~~* That is zoned for residential living (so not commercial, retail, industrial, etc space not intended for living in. There'd possibly be other ways to get them out of those zoned properties)~~\n\n* They have, or are able to secure entrances (put or change locks on doors) This may have been an OPTION for the occupant, not a requirement. \n\n\nAs long as someone maintains a presence within the unit, even if you owned the property, you could not force your way in. You would be considered to be breaking into someone's home, and able to be charged by the police as such. \n\n Now, if the guy left home stepped out to get a pack of smokes? Maybe even something as insignificant as taking the dog out to the yard for a piss. Tough shit for him then, the unit is unoccupied! Go right in and reclaim your building! Hope you had a witness! \n\nOtherwise, you'd better start the legal legwork to get them out, and not miss any I's or T's. They'll be doing the same thing to keep it. \n\nAs I said, I just remember the gist of what I read, in some random article (\"squatters rights\" or some such), YEARS ago on a website that's likely long gone, and that wasn't probably even talking about the US. So, grain of salt and all."

The nerves receive a certain amount of stimulus and will fire this being called a \"threshold level\", alcohol being a depressant will increase this threshold level so more and more stimulus is required for them to fire and send messages to other nerves.\n\nWhen you stand your body IS swaying back and forth but it's corrected with very little stimulus not being noticeable.

"People who ignore the homeless have a point.  The majority of the homeless are not simply people who have had bad luck.

If they become banned from the shelters, for instance, after being violent with other residents, whose fault is that?\n\nAs for the Great Depression, you can take the analysis or leave it.  But simply saying it was a \"different era\" doesn't explain anything.  It was a different era because the government had not yet engaged in social spending on a massive scale.  Yet the country did surprisingly well.  The government has arguably now created a negative incentive for private charity.  You are \"entitled\" now, and don't ever have to thank anyone."

"It's not really fair to say it has *nothing* to do with spin (in the classical sense).

"Because most bombs are either waterproof, or the water could actually trigger a detonation. The problem being, you don't know which!\n\nImprovised explosive device anatomy:\n\n* You have the explosive itself: Petrol, C4, TATP, whatever.\n\n* You have a detonator: This is a small explosive charge which normally uses an electrical current to detonate, and triggers detonation of the \"bulk\" of the bomb, the actual explosive.\n\n* you have a trigger circuit, on timer, switch or whatever, that passes the current to the detonator to trigger the explosion. This can be complex circuitry, or a very basic hacked together circuit.\n\nSo the LAST thing you want to do with an \"unknown\" device is chuck water at it. You could well cause the trigger mechnism to fail/engage, and detonate the explosion.\n\n\nIn real life, water can be used to destroy bombs, but it tends to be by way of a very powerful water jet that shreds all the parts away from one another and stops the bomb from being able to detonate, or even via a [shaped charge ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RclLCV9JUE). So water can be helpful in bomb disposal, but it's not a case of  \"dunk it and hope\"."
"&gt; Also, for many people, skills learned in the army don't lead to high paying careers (especially if you fail to do much rank climbing).\n\nThis. One of the biggest issues with the \"old military\" (Vietnam-era, roughly) was that most veterans were infantrymen. Those skills are largely useless in the civilian world unless you're going into a security field, but even then, most of those jobs require a law background/education. Vietnam vets make up a large part of the homeless veteran population due to drug addictions (which were much more common in that era), absolute crap VA support (if any), and the fact that most of that war was fought by draftees who were, as above, infantrymen with few transferable skills.\n\nNow, the logistics side of the services is much more developed. Medical and mechanical skills are highly transferable. Infantry makes up much less of the overall military population, rehabilitation for discharges is a bit better, and public opinion of the military is better. Still, medical aid isn't very good.\n\nSource: Dad's a Vietnam vet, aviation mechanic/pilot during the 60s, would have made serious bank working on hydraulics for Boeing if combat wounds hadn't disabled him."

"In my mind, because the month has the biggest variation during a typical watercooler conversation. Going on vacation in July is very different than going in January. Buying presents in February is different than buying presents in December. The specific days being less important... going on vacation on July 15th isn't much different than on July 21st. And the year is really immaterial unless the conversation is specifically *about* the year.\n\nTL;DR: For me, the month sets a huge context, the specific day less so, and the year is only important when it's the topic of conversation."
"Same here. Typically handwriting is influenced by the care the writer puts into it. The generalization is that girls are more preoccupied with making their handwriting graceful or aesthetically appealing. Guys are much less careful.

"None of those are emo.\n\nEdit: I feel as if I should clarify. Those bands tend to come from genres of music associated with the emo culture of the early 2000's - that is, screamo, post-hardcore, metalcore, and other similar genres that sort of blended in the early 21st century. If you want real emo music, you'll have to dig a bit deeper as it can trace its roots all the way back to the 1980's."

"I believe it is the whole idea of nutrient dense vs. calorie dense. Fast food is high in calories but does not have a lot of nutrition, whereas healthy food is more nutrient dense. Our bodies are designed to survive on nutrient dense foods, as we have been for thousands of years, and we are basically programmed to be satisfied by nutrients rather than just calories alone. \n\nA man actually did a study where he compared a Big Mac meal to apples in terms of calories. It took 18 apples to equate to the Big Mac meal, and when he tried to eat the apples in one sitting, he had a really hard time consuming that much food. But with mcdonalds, he remarked how he and his buddies could down a Big Mac meal in 10 minutes."

"The reason it's not done in real like is that bombs would logically be set up to fail deadly (opposite of fail-safe).\n\nA fail-safe mechanism is one that, in case something goes wrong, will default to a configuration most likely to produce a safe outcome. For example, the brakes on an 18-wheeler are fail-safe: during normal operation, pneumatic or hydraulic systems are in place that hold them open. In case of a leak or other damage to the brake system, the air or fluid will leak out, applying the brakes and preventing the truck from running away.\n\nA bomb, on the other hand, would probably be set up to fail deadly. What that means is that the timer isn't going to start the detonator; it might actually be preventing the detonator from going off. If you short out the timer, the detonator loses the inhibiting external force and activates, and our hero gets awful explodey."

"If the temperature of the air was the same temperature as the water in the shower/tub, it would still feel uncomfortable. The change in temperature causes changes to your body which opens your pores and blood flow. The lower temperature moist ambient air keeps you feeling comfortable and relaxed. \n\nWater has a much higher heat transfer coefficient than air. Staying in a hot bath for too long will feel uncomfortable, as your body reaches equilibrium with bath water. Normally this won't happen as the bath temperature will reach equilibrium with the ambient air. \n\nNot having clothes on, as well as having constant flow of water will also assist with your body's evaporative cooling. This is the main contributor to feelings of discomfort when outside. Evaporative cooling requires a differential to work. \n\n"

Junk food like fries, chips, etc., are usually pre-made foods that you mindlessly graze on. \n\n \n  \n  \n\nWhen you eat more slowly, you tend to feel full faster, therefore potentially reducing the amount of food you actually consume.

"The term has changed similar to the way the term \"heavy metal.\" has changed. Back in the day, 'emo' was short for 'emotive hardcore' refering to a particularly angsty hardcore punk rock sound that was present in bands like Minor threat (hardly associated with today's genre of emo music). This idea propagated and formed a separate emotive genre of purely angsty or otherwise emotionally expressive music which tends to focus on the expression of extreme emotions such as anger or sadness rather than the actual melody or beat. If you are \"on the same page\" as the feelings being expressed in the lyrics, the rest of the music becomes more palatable, and in good emo music (I honestly can't believe I uttered that phrase, but to each his own) the sound is meant to compliment the emotion and make one complete experience. This is why most people don't \"get\" it, because unless you are looking to experience a particular feeling in a particular manner, it just sounds like annoying crap.\n\nEdit: for the record, my first sentence references the idea that \"Heavy metal\" was originally a descriptor used for a heavy sound in hard rock bands of the time. This terms was used to describe bands like Led Zeppelin and I think was actually first actually used in reference to Aerosmith's sound in a Rolling Stone article. My point being that the term was coined to describe one musical idea, and that idea spawned an only partially related style of music which sounds completely different than what the term originally described."

"Okay, \nThis all comes down to what is in the food we eat. Let's look at this in the nutritional aspect of the foods we eat. \n\nIn the most basic sense, our body tells us we are hungry because we are laking the nutrients our body needs. When we eat fast food or junk food, there is little nutritional benefit from these foods so our body keeps craving food in hopes to fill the nutritional void. So although we may be full, in a short amount of time, we are still craving foods to reap the nutrition we need. \n\nWhen we eat healthy, we are getting more of the nutrients our body needs. Once our body gets those nutrients, our body tells us that we no longer need food and feel full. \n\nAlso, remember that organic doesn't necessary mean healthy! Eat on!"

If the legislatures aren't satisfied, they can try to rewrite it to fit the constitution or in the case of the federal legislature, if they can muster the votes, they can call for a constitutional convention to draft an amendment to change the constitution that must then be supported by a passing vote amongst the states."

" Consider the lottery winners who are back in the trailer park 5 years later.  I believe the US \"war on poverty\" actually costs more than just giving a living wage to everyone poor, at least if you include infrastructure and other indirect costs.  Poor people are poor because of poor spending habits (often culturally reinforced and societally encouraged or allowed) so giving them money doesn't get them unpoor.  The same is often true of poor countries, which mismanage their resources, sell them to international corporations for pennies on the dollar, and burden their people with bureaucracy and corruption.  Time spent waiting in line, carrying slips of paper from office to office, paying bribes to police and mailmen, and walking miles to work is time not spent adding anything to the economy that anyone else wants to buy.  Giving people money (if it even reaches them and isn't stolen by politicians) fixes none of these problems.\n\nWhat's even worse is that handouts foster a culture of getting handouts, which is not the same as a culture of earning money.  We all know of people who choose not to work because it would make them ineligible for welfare, or make them have to start paying off their student loans, or something.  Imagine a whole country of people who get more stuff by waiting in line for rice handouts than by earning money making or selling things of value.  "

So the question's really beyond caloric intake. \n\nI second in_the_city. Nutrient density should have a lot to do with OP's question. While fast food is not nutrient-dense, it takes less space in the stomach, plausibly slowing down grhelin decreases and dampening postprandrial CCK stimulation (thus eating more); Healthy food (depending on how you define healthy) may have a larger ratio of volume/weight:nutrients so signaling goes okay with what can seem to be less food."

"Jurors (generally speaking) are not experts of law.

For example, whether evidence is permissible or not, or whether testimony is valid or not.\n\nIf a trial were a football or basketball game, the judge would be the referee, and the jury would be the scorekeepers.\n\nIf you are the defendant or the defendant's attorney (in the USA), and you KNOW that your case is overwhelming, the best thing that you can do is to threaten the prosecution with a Bench Trial.  In this case, you are waiving the defendant's right to a jury trial, and the judge serves as both judge and jury.  Since the judge is an expert of law (he should be, at least), the prosecution is going to realize that his bluff has been called, and will seek a settlement out of court.

It is way more complicated then what is being said here. I cite those subs because they have a lot of great information that is in stark contrast to /u/Xor_'s claims. \n\nEspecially with fast food. The companies behind fast foods have literally armies of people dedicated to finding the exact things that make food attractive and blowing them out of proportion to make you eat more. These foods have exactly the right amount of salt/sweetness to draw you in. Furthermore, despite what the previous poster said, most of the fast foods that you consume are high in carbohydrates as well as fat. \n\nSo, what I am saying is I disagree with the claim about fat being the issue. For example, I bet if you eat some eggs or an avocado you will feel full. These foods are high in fat and protein and are satiating.\n\nMy argument here is that salt and fat aren't that bad for you, and quite frankly are good for you. Sugar is a problem. However the biggest problem is that with fast food, each item on the menu is designed to be as addicting as possible with the exact right crunchiness, texture, sweetness, saltiness, and whatever else to get your body to want more. \n\nI can only have so many eggs and bacon before I feel full.

"I don't believe anyone completely understands it.  But what I have read is that this a subconscious behavior that encourages social bonding.  We subconsciously attempt to feel in-step with those around us in order to feel we are part of the group, and perhaps to signal that we aren't a threat to the group.  \"It's okay, I'm a good person just like you!\" \n\nRobin Williams' character in The Dead Poet's Society demonstrated the effect by having his students walk in a circle in the courtyard.  Without even realizing it they started marching in step, and then consciously had fun marching in step.\n\nThere are many other subtle behaviors that humans tend to mimic in one another.  Body movements, facial expressions, touching certain parts of our faces while talking, etc.  Yawning may be a more obvious example.  Some people who have studied behavioral psychology very deeply can, with a surprisingly high degree of success, cause other people to do certain things, such as scratching their faces, by making subtle behavioral and/or verbal suggestions of which the subject isn't aware.\n\nI suppose we get along more or less by sending each other such subtle signals.  That being said, humans also have a great love for symmetry, and marching in step is very symmetrical.  Trying walking with a friend sometime while having a conversation and then consciously try to walk out of step with them.  Chances are it will make maintaining the conversation very difficult for you.  You're brain will be fighting so hard to match their footsteps that you can't think straight."

"They are *all* cults, and all have changed their minds about many things over the years.  Religions, over time, always drift towards what is the most easily accepted and/or convenient for them.\n\nFor example, the idea of the immaculate conception of Mary dates back to around the 2nd century.  But it was not always generally accepted, and in fact was debated and rejected by some notable church fathers such as Thomas Aquinas.  It didn't *officially* become part of the church's dogma until the latter half of the 19th century.\n\nI'm not knocking Catholics mind you, except insofar as I see all religion as being silly.  Catholics believe that truth can be deduced from traditions as well as scriptures.  That is the same for Jews, who have an entire body of religious thought outside of the Torah itself.  Some of it is very sound philosophy whether you are religious or not."

Yes we know time is a factor in inertia but it is not an explanation of what time is. It is if anything another tautology one that goes like this: time is a factor in determining inertia which itself is the tendency of objects to keep moving in a straight line over time. You cannot define time by referencing inertia because inertia is defined by movement over time, *it is a circular reference*.  \nTo edify yourself read the wikipedia article on time http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time you'll notice straight away the first line is \"Time is a dimension in which events can be ordered from the past through the present into the future and also the measure of durations of events and the intervals between them.\" Amazeballs! a definition of time we don't need to look any further!  \n**Except read a bit further**  \nTime has long been a major subject of study in religion, philosophy, and science, but defining it in a manner applicable to all fields without circularity has consistently eluded scholars.  \nBummer! The smartest people ever to existed do not actually know how to define time without going into circular references like the one above.

I'm just saying US has some mindbogglingly horrible structural issues.  We should be concerned about these things as American citizens, not blindly sweep them under the rug.\n\n**edit:** and anyway, you're wrong, US doesn't have the highest median income in the world.  Whether you use nominal or purchasing power, in either case, it's high but not the highest.  I wouldn't want to be a part of some of the other countries with high household incomes either.  [Singapore's median household income](http://www.singstat.gov.sg/Publications/publications_and_papers/household_income_and_expenditure/pp-s19.pdf) is around 72,000 USD per year, but they also have really expensive healthcare and long, long work hours.

"I'm sorry, but you are implying that fat is unhealthy. It is not.

Eat two full chicken breasts and you'll be hungry an hour later. Why? Because neither contains sufficient fats.\n\nEvery meal's calories should come from a balanced mix of complete proteins (specifically, essential amino acids), fat, and complex carbohydrates.\n\nFurther, fiber makes a HUGE difference in how full you feel. Ever over-eat baby carrots? High in fiber, and eating what feels like a small quantity can make you feel very full, or painfully stuffed if you eat too many.\n\nYou can eat a ton of fast food without feeling full probably because of additives, pure taste, low quality carbs, and lack of fiber."

"I would think the main reason is what would happen if you did pour water on electronic circuitry, it would create short circuits across the components and increase the chance of detonation. water damages circuits because of high currents across components that weren't designed for high current. if you take the power source off of most electronics and submerge them in water, when dry they will work just as they did before the submersion. you could dip your cell phone in oil and it would still work fine for the most part because it contains no water. oil is used as a coolant in high voltage transformers. water has minerals that act as conductors, the more minerals the better the conductor. you might get away with a quick submersion in distilled water as most of the minerals have been left behind from the boiling process. I make collodial silver from distilled water and it takes quite a long while ( days ) to get enough conductivity to transfer any significant current. tap water will cook my electrodes in less than 1 hour.\nEdit: also , I have a degree in electrical engineering, but that doesn't make me smart, just trained well."

"I think the quirk you referenced really just boils down to politics having two legs: social issues, and economic issues. Social regulation is a VERY, VERY deeply rooted element of human nature. We are born to be selective judging machines that collectively regulate the behaviors of those around us, and prune those that don't fit. Economics, meanwhile, is something new and totally alien to our evolution. We, as a species, are not even good at numbers or math, which is a double blow for our ability to vote sensibly along economic policy.\n\nThus it's no surprise that voters, especially those with lower intelligence levels or those who have poor education, tend to be more easily manipulated by social issues than economic issues.\n\nWhat's more, economic debates are easily spun into social debates. Every time economics comes up during a debate, it's never about raw math. It's always about it's social impact. \"Wealth redistribution punishes the hard-working and rewards the lazy or those without a sense of personal responsibility\". That is a social argument. Even if, mathematically speaking, society as a whole benefits from a low Gini coefficient, the social aspect of a policy like that resonates more strongly with people.\n\nThis is how low-income households will routinely vote against their own financial self-interests.\n\nThat said, as someone who makes a middle class salary, I'm kind of glad that lower income earners tend to vote along lines that help me keep more of my own money for myself..."
"Quite right. Something to consider, though, is that our ancestors rarely came across items high in sugar. It is hypothesized amongst some physical anthropologists that the *Homo* tree evolved depth of field AND color vision to pick out fruit in trees, since our Order has primarily been aboriginal over the past million(?) or so years. More so, when we spot a season fruit (say: apple) our brain says something along the lines of \"oooohhh sugary food! I should eat this now because I may not see it again for months!\" As my anthropology teacher explained it to the class, we get that \"oohh sugar/many months\" urge *whenever* we see junk food. 10,000 years of being farmers, and 50 years of junk food, is just not long enough to evolve out that craving for sugar. We would probably evolve a resistance to diabetes before we lose the \"oohh sugar/many months\" cravings.\n\nMind you, this is just a hypothesis. "

I can't credit education, as I don't have a college degree. Granted, I did have good middle school and high school education.\n\nHowever, I'm not making $95,000/year of other people's money. I wasn't given a job to fill a quota. I earned my job, and I earn my pay. \n\nThe real issue is with social mobility is a definite lack in early education opportunity, and a vicious cycle of bad parenting.\n\nOn the flip side of my story, is my friend's story. He's an intelligent person, grew up in a loving household, but for one reason or another, is one hell of a lazy/unmotivated human being. He lost his job and has been living off unemployment for the last year or so. He was going to school to earn an associates degree, and you'd think with all the free time not having a job and all, that he would excel at his classes. Nope. Played video games all day, failed his classes. Doesn't even drink, smoke, or do drugs, just applies his addiction to video games. Went on 2 job interviews in 12 months (fuck knows how he qualified for continued unemployement, I thought you had to prove you were looking for a job...) Basically he is a text-book example of why Republicans want to get rid of welfare (and I honestly can't blame them). \n\nI know these are just anecdotes to you, but they shape how I view social mobility, and to me, the lion's share of social mobility is what you make of it. You can sit on your ass and not do a damn thing to improve the quality of your life, OR you can simply tell yourself \"I can do better\", map out the steps needed to get from A to B, and then do them. \n\nIt's not rocket science. It just takes self-motivation, and I don't believe that people who lack self-motivation should be given money out of my pocket. Falling on hard times is one thing, and social safety nets are a good thing. But safety nets should not be hammocks."

"You're asking a lot of different and very vague questions. I'll do my best to help.\n\nStocks are small parts of a company that are available for purchase. When you purchase stocks, you're giving the company money for partial ownership and representation of that company.\n\nA dollar lowers or rises in value for a variety of reasons. Supply and demand for the dollar can change its value. If more people demand US dollars, then their value will rise. If more dollar bills are printed and demand doesn't change, the value of those dollar bills will decrease. Essentially, the dollar bill has a value because people will accept it and the US government says you can spend them. The value of a dollar used to be based on a fixed amount of gold, but that is no longer the case. This answer is more complex than I can fully explain, but I hope it helped a bit.\n\nWhy can't we all use the same currency? Because one country's failures would hurt a lot of other countries' economies, but one country's successes would become muted and muffled. Multiple currencies throughout the world allow the world's economies to expand and shrink without totally tanking other economies.\n\nMoney is much more complex than a simple ELI5 can answer.

This means that it will match up for a few flashes, and then drift off again.

Pain is to tell you to stop doing something because it's causing injury.  However, while in fight or flight mode there's no benefit to stopping what you are doing to protect your injury because that's going to get you killed.  Because of this the brain will ignore injuries, up to a point, while engaged in that survival mode."

"Language translation is a very long, very hard task, made difficult by the fact that many languages are written in a script/alphabet fundamentally different to English (assuming that the translator speaks English).\n\nTypically, the translator learns the new language, and matches up words that have meaning in his language, with the corresponding words from the other language.  Sometimes, in the new language, there are phrases that do not translate backwards - hence you end up with things like *Zeitgest*, meaning *spirit of the times* - English uses four words instead of the one German word.\n\nAdditionally, it becomes harder when there are grammatical issues.  Sometimes, the way things work to construct sentences and reference objects, are different between languages.  For instance, French references objects as either male, female, or gender-neutral, whereas English assumes all objects are neutral, unless explicitly referring to something belonging to a male or female (some exceptions from old English still apply).\n\nTranslation is an ongoing work, and places like www.duolingo.com are actively using communities to help translate works (usually Wikipedia pages, but sometimes commissioned works) into different languages."
"Less is more is a pretty general principle so that's easier to explain. With less distractions it becomes easier to focus on what's truly important. A whisper in a silent church is easier to understand than a shouting man in a crowd of shouting men.\n\nThe principle of less is more is true in nearly all things. [This comic book page has so many details that it's hard to focus on what's really going on.](http://dacostilla.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/hard_boiled_1_0607.jpg) By comparison Studio Ghibli tries to focus attention on the most important elements of a scene [by choosing vibrant colors and flat art styles for the most important elements of a scene while less important elements like backgrounds get more muted colors.](http://images8.alphacoders.com/420/420284.jpg) Less distracting elements enforces the primary message.\n\nThese days most people multitask when working. Multiple open windows on a computer. Email, instant messenger, smart phones yelling push notifications, coworkers walking in and out. This does not make people more productive or efficient. Focusing on a single task until it is complete usually yields better results. \n\nYou can't do everything at once, do one thing well. Then do the next thing well... and the next.\n\nWhich brings us to zen. Zen is spiritual and philosophical. I don't really want to get into that because it's too broad a subject. You can read for hours by following wiki trails on zen if you want to.\n\nApplying zen in your daily life however ties in quite nicely with the principle of less is more. We live noisy lives, most of us are doing many things at once and it's preventing us from focusing on (and often even noticing) what's truly important at any given time.\n\nDuring any given breakfast I'm reading the news, reading my e-mail, shoveling breakfast into my mouth, mulling over mistakes, regrets, things that went wrong the past week and the stuff I want to get right today or this week. None of which is making me perform any better at what I'm supposed to be doing or feel any better emotionally.\n\nPractical zen means live in the moment. Focus on the task at hand in order to do it to the best of your ability. If you are eating breakfast, eat breakfast and nothing else. If you are sweeping the floor, think about sweeping the floor, not what your friend gossiped about you yesterday. If you are with your friends, be with your friends and not on your phone.\n\nSince there's so much history, spirituality and philosophy behind zen you quickly end up with concepts about enlightenment and such. Which is great if you're looking to hold a discussion about zen. To me, what it really comes down to is creating a clean and healthy mindset. Which is really hard enough for most of us.\n\nImprove your mental health, your emotional health and your physical health by making a conscious effort to live and act in the now instead of spreading yourself thin across a million things. Finding peace by doing this is zen."

"Stocks are partial ownership in a company. If you owned a company and someone wanted to buy 25% of the company, you could create 4 shares of stock for the company and then sell one of the 4 shares. Likewise, if you buy more than half of all shares of stock in any company, you control that company. \nThe dollar's value is tied to stability of the country that issues it. If the United States government collapsed tomorrow, the United States dollar would be worthless (just like the Confederate dollar became worthless when the Confederate States of America stopped existing.) Even though we're nowhere near collapse, the dollar will still lose value when we simply go from \"great\" to \"good.\"\nThe world doesn't just use the same currency because there are some advantages by controlling your own currency if you are the government of a country.

I got that and a shake (cup of chemical waste is what it was). \n\nHonestly, it's a good thing I didn't eat in my car as it went through me so fast.

"This is far from accurate.  A judge can set aside a jury's *guilty* verdict because he/she understands a point of law better than they do and may feel that they reached their conclusion based on emotion.  A judge's job is to protect the defendants rights, even from an angry jury if need be.\n\nBut America has a long history of something called Jury Nullification.  A judge cannot set aside an *acquittal* regardless of the reason the jury reached that verdict.  It's called nullification because the jury can nullify the law, essentially declaring the law to be unjust or at least not applicable in that case.\n\nIf a jury says \"Not Guilty\" that is the end of the story.  The defendant is then protected by the Double Jeopardy clause of the 5th amendment and cannot be tried again (for the same offense).\n\nOddly enough, the Supreme Court of the U.S. has upheld a court's right to simply not *inform* jurors of their (common law) right to nullify the law, and may even allow a judge to replace a juror (prior to a verdict) who seems bent on nullification, but juries retain the right of nullification nonetheless.  If a jury votes for acquittal, that's the last word.\n\nIt's been done many times.  Notable examples were Northern juries refusing to convict people for violating the fugitive slave law (e.g. for not returning an escaped slave).  There were also many cases of jury nullification during prohibition when people were placed on trial and the jury essentially said \"Screw you, Uncle Sam\".  That was by some estimates up to 50% of alcohol law cases at the time.\n\nIt still happens from time to time today.  Jack Kevorkian (Dr. Death) was arguably acquitted more than once via jury nullification.  Juries sometimes nullify the law in particular cases based on mercy and emotion, such as acquitting an otherwise good kid caught red-handed with a bag of weed.\n\nFrom memory, I seem to remember that some researchers estimate that about 2%-5% of acquittals are acts of nullification."

"Time as in man's invention of the concept, is merely a tool to measure change. Time as in the universal property of *change*, is something different.\n\nThat change can be characterized as the progression from order to disorder (e.g. a sandcastle slowly eroding due to waves or the wind), though I disagree with that. I believe perfect order is perfect equilibrium. Clumps of matter and energy unevenly distributed is what I would consider disorder, even if it has structure.\n\nEither way, time is really the universal property of change from an ordered/disordered state to a disordered/ordered state. It really isn't much more complicated than that. Time as a tool, merely measures that change."
"You're right, I didn't explain that clearly. Let me elaborate. \n\nWe don't know exactly what causes homosexuality, but this theory assumes at least some genetic component. \n\nPresumably some of the same genes that contribute to homosexuality would also be passed along to the siblings of gay individuals, even though they aren't expressed. And their children would be more likely to succeed due to their gay aunt or uncle. \n\nIt's very similar to sickle cell anemia. It's a recessive gene. If you have genes for anemia you get the disease, which is a disadvantage. But having just one gene for anemia then you don't get the disease, and in fact confers resistance to malaria. So even though sickle cell anemia is a huge disadvantage, the genes for it keep getting passed down. \n\nI hope that clarifies a bit. There are other theories as well, of course, including the fact that many homosexual individuals do manage to reproduce, even today. Not to mention that there are plenty of people who aren't completely straight or gay. There's a whole spectrum. \n\nSince we don't know exactly what causes homosexuality we really don't know how it might be passed along. But that's the most common theory that I've heard. "

"A protein is a long string of amino acids, which are a type of carbon compound.\n\nWhat's special about amino acids is that they have an amine group on one end and a carboxylic acid on the other.  Amine groups link up to carboxylic acid groups to form peptide bonds, and as each amino acid has both kinds of groups, you get a long chain-like structure.\n\nThere are many different kinds of amino acid, and a particular protein, like hemoglobin (which carries oxygen and carbon dioxide around your body) is formed by a particular combination of these types.  \n\nA lot of what's important about proteins is their shape, which is determined by the order of the amino acids that make it up, because different types of acid attract and repel with different strengths. If you look at the wikipedia page for hemoglobin, for example, the picture may look a little confusing - you have to remember that proteins are massive molecules, and the ribbon type things you can see represent very long peptide chains.\n\nSo as for coding for proteins, your body takes in proteins and breaks them down into their component amino acids before re-assembling them into most of the materials that make up your body.  It does this by reading off the 'code' from your DNA.\n\nWhen we talk about 'coding' for a protein, we mean that this particular bit of the gene contains the information that tells the body what order to put the amino acids together in to make the right protein to do it's job.  Pretty neat."

"That sounds like a terrible study. If he'd compared apples to celery, he'd have to eat more than three times as much celery (by weight) to equal the calories in a given amount of apples. Nutrient and calorie density doesn't enter into it; your body isn't digesting this stuff and relaying information to your brain about nutrients and calories anywhere near fast enough for you to get the message compared to \"stomach full to bursting, please stop\". Even then, it can take a while for that \"stomach full\" message to be processed, which is why a cornerstone of dieting is to eat meals slowly or pause so that you can recognize when you're satisfied without having eaten far more than was necessary.\n\n\nFast food is quick to eat. It takes less energy for you to chew a bite of burger or fry than a hard apple, so you can put away the burgers faster than you would an equal-sized portion of apples. But you could process those apples (say, by making them apple sauce) to the point that you could eat apples faster than a burger. Do you think you could finish a 48 ounce container of applesauce by chugging it faster than you could that same container with a bunch of burgers smushed into it? Do you think you'd fill up faster on healthy applesauce that's nothing but smushed apples in its own juice vs. store-bought stuff from a can or jar loaded with preservatives and sugar? Meanwhile, you could trump the calories in all those apples *and* burgers with a few spoonfuls of peanut butter or guacamole and still be left hungry. \n\n\nTL;DR -- it's about food volume and its density as a material, nothing to do with nutrients and calories. Fast food tends to be low on substance and quick to eat, letting you fill your stomach with more of it before you realize you're full. Eat slower and you won't eat as much.\n\n"
"This is a process known as language divergence. You defined it spot on. I'd also like to add, the converse can happen. This is known as language convergence. Typically, this occurs when two populations with different languages suddenly need to be able to communicate. The initial, simplistic language is called a pidgin language. It typically does not feature all parts of a language. However, it gets the job of communication done. Ex: Texican. English(Texas), and Mexican. When this language finally evolves, it creates a whole new language, called a Creole language. This is a fully fledged languages. Ex: .....well...the name....Creole.....lol the Creole lang, I forget the 2 parent languages. \r\rSource: I'm a HS student currently in AP Human Geography"

"So I've answered this question before. I'm gonna copy paste my answer. It should apply:\n\n&gt;Op question: can you tell the difference between frame rates:\n\nYes you absolutely can tell the difference between 17, 24, 30, 48 and 160 fps. Your eyes don't really see more than 14-18 fps. But they can register the difference between higher frame rates. The reason we play movies at 24fps is because that's about the fps of a dream. So when you turn down the lights in a theatre and play a movie at 24 fps people are ever so slightly pulled into what they are watching and immersed in it because it is similar to a dream. If you played a movie in a theatre at 30 fps people would get bored. There have been studies into this.\n\n&gt;op question: what is the resolution of the human eye. Can we see the difference between 4k and 1080p:\n\n4k resolution is around ~8.3 megapixels (depending on the size of the screen). The human eye, if it were a digital camera would have a resolution of 576 megapixels. So yes. The human eye can perceive orders of magnitude more definition than 4k and 8k displays. \n"

"Solution:\nFast food is made so it will be digested very fast. It will make you full for about 30 - 60 min. then you get hungry again.\nAlso you can compress it very good (squezze a cheeseburger, it is easy), your stomach will compress it with muscles and acid.\n\nHealthy food however is healthy because it will be digested slowly and also is not very good compressable.

"Complex carbohydrates vs Simple carbohydrates. The Food Doctor books are really good at tackling this; essentially about how the increase in fiber will make your food take slower to digest, and how the milder effect on your blood sugar increases appetite control. So whole wheat, starchy vegetables, legumes etc are counted as complex and are often touted as the healthier alternative. I don't know if it answers your question in it's entirety, but it can explain why you feel fuller after brown pasta than with white. \n\nRegarding the McDonalds: looking at the calorie tables they've provided, you only get 2-3 grams of fiber per burger. It is recommended that women have 25g a day, and that men have 38g. This could explain why you don't get the same full feeling when consuming the same amount of calories from a different source. So if you had 4 Big Macs, you would consume 2200 calories (almost a GDA for a male, and over that for a female) but only 12 grams of fiber which is less than half for a woman, and less than a third for a man. \n\nHope this helps :') "

"&gt;The reason we play movies at 24fps is because that's about the fps of a dream.\n\nNo, the reason is that film was expensive, and shooting at 24 fps was around the minimum framerate that we could perceive as relatively smooth motion.

"The first and most ancient form of verbal communication between homosapiens is believed to be none other than only clicks. Just patterns of clicks, like Morse code, b/c that's all we knew how to do.

I think a documentary by the Discovery channel goes more in detail; search, The Journey of Man. Now for literate communication, I know that the first forms were scratches, cave drawings, and tools. The scratches evolved like spoken word. Cave drawings...well, they were cave drawings. The concept of drawing what you see hasn't changed. The third part; simply, people communicated for peace or working together, by helping each other. The only way to help was performing a skill, such as hunting, or providing/teaching a material, like sharpening a stone.

"I have worked for various NGOs and in fact I established a non-profit not too long ago so perhaps I can provide some insight.\n\nThese points are in no particular order:\n\n*  There are a lot of overhead costs for such organizations, similar to companies and etc.  The payment of employees, storage, shipment, marketing, the list goes on.  \n\n* Corruption and inefficiency - For the case of food, contrary to popular opinion there is easily enough donated food to prevent world hunger however due to corruption and inefficiency in these various countries.  Warlords stealing the food and selling it for profit, fake non-profits exploiting both the donors and the \"recipients\", etc.  (although this is more a problem for micro-financing but that's another story), corrupt politicians, the list goes on.  This is an over-simplification of the issue but this is a big factor.\n\n* This is a controversial view and hot topic but for many countries/companies/entities/etc. it is for their best interests that such countries remain poor and undeveloped.  Cheap labor, low cost, relaxed laws for mining/extraction of resources. If these countries become more developed then costs would rise due to higher standard of living, less corruption, etc.  One example of this is the economic rise of China, before the economic boom of the country many entities flocked to China and established their presence.  However due to the economic rise of China, which includes higher wages, standard of living, costs and etc, many companies and such are now instead moving their presence to even less developed countries such as Vietnam, Indonesia and etc.  Many countries, such as the Persian Gulf states of Qatar, the UAE and etc, rely on \"migrant workers\" (pretty much modern day slavery) from countries such as India, Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines, etc. to build infrastructure, pretty much be low cost labor for next to nothing.  The conditions in these countries are horrifying but the sad truth is that it's slightly better than what exists back in their own countries so they migrate overseas in hopes of a better life.  I'll go into more detail about this potentially dangerous cycle in another point.  \n\n* Believe it or not despite all this aid is temporary and doesn't do anything long term.  For example food is great but eventually it is consumed and more is required to be brought in.  What is necessary for these communities, countries and etc. to truly develop is to establish education for the current and future generations, build infrastructure to support long term growth and so forth.  \n\n* It all comes to this point, in the end it's a dangerous cycle.  These countries/communities are poor and under-developed, these is no education or future for the people, aid comes from various countries/organizations/etc. such as food, capital and such are either consumed or are instead set apart via corruption and bureaucracy.  In this generation due to the need for migrant workers overseas many go overseas in search of better opportunities, however in the end these communities are not fully developed to its full potential.  The new generation is born and the same problems exist, hence the cycle starts over.  \n    \n\n* Ironically due to great development of technology in the developed world, such as in Silicon Valley, the divide between the developed and developing world is becoming greater than ever.  It is called the *Digital Divide* and since such underdeveloped nations don't have access to such resources or technology it is becoming more unequal than ever in history.\n\nAll this is an over-simplification and there are other points but this is the gist of it.\n\nActually one of the reasons I started an NGO is to (attempt) to tackle the problem of education but that's another topic.  If you have any questions and such feel free to ask!\n\nEDIT: Added a little clarification in regards to the cycle in such developing nations, including the Digital Divide."

"The reason is - SPICES, SALT, AND SUGAR. Healthy food contains less spices, less sugar, and less salt. Most foods don't taste like anything. Try to eat unprocessed meat, pasta, or potatos boiled in plain water with no spices and no salt. Even roasted chicken alone (don't season it while you're roasting it) wouldn't taste very good. If you eat food with no seasonings whatsoever, your body will very soon tell you that you don't need more - because you don't need more.\n\nSpices, salt, and sugar make you enjoy food more. The more of them you put on your food, the more you'll enjoy the food, and the more you'll be able to eat. Unhealthy food is made from the same ingredients as healthy food, but it contains much more spices, salt, and sugar. The same is true for liquids.

"Heat can simply be redefined as a measurement of the movement of particles. That's being said, heat is also the biggest byproduct of chemical reactions, which is basically two particles moving together (or apart) extremely quickly. Therefore, one can deduce that when your cells make chemical reactions to produce energy to cause contractions in muscles, that energy is measured and released in the form of heat. \r\rWhen we get sick, our body heats up naturally as an auto-immune effect. Heat kills bacteria-&gt; to prevent overheating, sweating occurs."
"A lot of English swear words are swear words because the French conquered England back in 1066.  A lot of the nobility then started speaking French.

The more polite words we use today for those things are usually based on French words.  And yes, copulation comes from French.  Fucking comes from those Anglo Saxons who brought the Germanic language to England which then became English."
"Your body is specially programmed to not to feel full when eating meat or high fat content food.\nIn evolution terms, we are still hunter/gatherers, when our ancestors managed to kill something, which was a rare event, they had to be able to eat as much as they can because it gets spoiled rather quickly.\n\nThat's also why fat makes things taste better. Evolution made that treat because yummier food make us try harder to kill prey.\n\nFast food imitates \"prey\", and we are highly attracted to it.\n"
"Doctor here. Let's clarify a couple of things: satiety equates to fullness. If we're talking about feeling more satiated, that means you would want to eat *less*.\n\nAlso, fats are one of the weaker satiety signals. Carbohydrates and protein result in release of insulin and ghrelin, which promote satiety. A healthy steak and potatoes should therefore fill you up much more than a greasy Random Meat McGuzzlefuck burger, which is all fat and saturated carbohydrates.\n\nSo, fast food makes you feel *less* satiated, and it's because of the high fat content. And also the high salt and MSG content, which as you rightly point out, probably results in an increased dopaminergic response. Bear in mind though, all food does this. We evolved to want to eat, and that's the trait that's killing us."

But why?\n\nYour body is used to certain foods that generally appear in nature (think tribal hunter gatherer times).  Generally our body releases hormones telling us we are full, but that hormone response is based on what the body recognizes as normal food.  Where in nature can you find a food source that has salt and sugar?  How about fat and salt?  What about fat, salt and sugar?  It would be rare to find these combinations in nature.\n\nWhat you are calling fast (unhealthy) food is food that has unnatural combinations of both macro and micro nutrients and our bodies do not understand the chemical signals they receive when eating this type of \"food\".

"Everyone else pointed out that drinking your own blood (or anyone's blood for that matter) will not put it back into circulation;\n\nHaving said that, there are two other reasons drinking your blood wouldn't work\n\nFirst, the stomach really doesn't like blood; people with esophageal varicosities (varicose veins inside the esophagus) will bleed large amounts of blood into their stomachs, if these rupture, and it almost always results in gouts of vomiting.\n\nSecond, blood is \"salty\", containing various things other than plain water, of course.  If you could keep from vomiting it back up, and it entered the lower digestion, your body would be forced to remove water from other spaces to process the blood. "
"The ultra simple answer: \n\n1. Fiber and protein fills you up better than carbohydrates. \n\n2. Foods that have a crunchy texture and take time to chew will make you ingest the food slower.

Then imagine having to chew through roasted meet and potatoes with a bit of slightly cooked veggies on the side. Takes much more effort."

"Grocer here: Kale is a type of leafy lettuce found in your produce aisle with the band LU#4612 to make sure you pick out the right one. Happy eating :)\n\nWikipedia's take on Kale.\n&gt; Kale is very high in beta carotene, vitamin K, vitamin C, and rich in calcium. Kale is a source of two carotenoids, lutein and zeaxanthin. Kale, as with broccoli and other brassicas, contains sulforaphane (particularly when chopped or minced), a chemical with potent anti-cancer properties. Boiling decreases the level of sulforaphane; however, steaming, microwaving, or stir frying do not result in significant loss. Along with other brassica vegetables, kale is also a source of indole-3-carbinol, a chemical which boosts DNA repair in cells and appears to block the growth of cancer cells. Kale has been found to contain a group of resins known as bile acid sequestrants, which have been shown to lower cholesterol and decrease absorption of dietary fat. Steaming significantly increases these bile acid binding properties."

But aside of those, the Wikipedias are free to adopt their own policies, though those processes are often adopted and adapted from processes in other wikis.\n\nThe problem with the smaller Wikipedias is actually two-fold: First of all, they have a smaller user community, and sometimes smaller communities can be persuaded easily to do controversial things - there may not be enough people to put their foot down. It's also that because the communities are smaller, the folks in other Wikipedias and the folks in the Wikimedia Foundation might not pay as much attention to the projects. Secondly, nationalism often gets out of hand. Wikipedias are supposed to be \"Wikipedias for all people around the world who speak a specific language\", but often end up being \"Wikipedias for the country whose national language is whatever\". In other words, Wikipedias are supposed to cover topics from global perspective, but end up covering local things because that's what the speakers of the languages care most about. There's nothing wrong with covering local things, of course, but local *slant* might be a problem in light that neutrality is a core policy for all Wikipedias. And one-sided political slants end up being extremely problematic, of course.\n\nAnd I think that's what has happened here. A small group of users with nationalistic slant got a major hold of the project.\n\nAs for how will this affect English Wikipedia - it's probably not going to affect other Wikipedia wikis directly (especially ones that already have a large enough community that can stop this sort of banality from happening), but I expect that the Wikimedia Foundation will have to rethink their stuff pretty badly. This sort of issues have been happening for a long time, they should really start developing policies that would stop this sort of stuff. Even if it means that they have to spend more time and energy actively monitoring the smaller wikis."

"Sugar and grease. The sugar increases your appetite, and makes you want to eat more. It can even keep you from feeling full. \n\nThe grease literally lubricates your mouth and throat as you chew, making it easier to chew and swallow. Vegetables are frequently very fibrous and make your jaw tired. Cheeseburgers and relatively easier to chew and slide down easy thanks to the fat. \n\nAlso, feeling full is a delayed reaction. It can take up to 30 minutes to get that stuffed feeling after your stomach fills up. Since fast food is easier to chew and swallow, and turns up your appetite, you most likely eat it faster than other foods, and can therefore eat more before feeling full. \n\n"

"When you're taking a hot bath many people assume the water is about 80-90 degrees celcius. Almost near the boiling point of water because one can observe water vapor leave the surface. Even though its a good observation its far from the truth\n\nThe temperature of your bath water is determined by the average kinetic energy of the water molecules. Meaning the average speed the water molecules are buzzing around in ur bath. If a molecule has sufficient energy(speed); itll turn into water vapor. The key word here is average. Many water molecules in your bath will be 100C (boiling point) and leave the surface, but many will also have significantly less.\n\nThe reason why your flesh doesnt boil is because the average speed of the water molecules isnt high enough. There will be molecules with enough kinetic energy to technically boil you, but there just aren't enough of them in a regular hot bath. Most of them will be about 20-30C. And your flesh can handle 20-30C without any problems."

"I'm glad that someone raised calorie density, it is a really elegant concept which helps to explain what's going on here nicely. But let me explain in context with a few other things, including a brief touch on satiety mechanisms, weight loss and the 'pleasure trap' (a term from an amazing psychologist called Doug Lisle). It gets a bit technical (sorry). \n\nCalorie density: If you eat a less dense food you can eat only so much of it. If, for example, you wanted to get your calories for the day from only eating lettuce, you'd have to eat about 17.8kg of lettuce (calculated from the nutritional information on iceberg lettuce on the USDA website, and an average estimated energy intake for an adult male of about 10,000kJ). To explain why, I'll just give you an intro into nutrition (very quickly). All food is made up of macro ('big') and micro ('small') nutrients. Macronutrients make up all foods, they are carbohydrates, protein, or fat (alcohol is the fourth category on this list... of three...). Micronutrients are vitamins and minerals, found in very small amounts in these food. If you wanted to get your calories purely from one of the macronutrients (using fairly standard numbers of about 16kJ per gram for protein and carbohydrate, and 37kJ per gram), then you'd have to eat 10,000kJ (daily intake) / 37kJ per gram = 280g of pure fat (be it extra virgin olive oil or pure lard). If it were pure protein or carbohydrates (pure form of carbohydrates without water or fibre = pure sugar, and 'pure' protein doesn't exist except when equally and strangely processed into weird powders or whatnots), then the total energy intake for one day is 10,000kJ / 17 kJ per gram = 590g. Iceberg lettuce has an energy density far less than pure sugar though, because it contains lots of fibre (which is not really digestible by humans, but provides a small amount of sugar, about 5kJ per gram), and lots of water. Both of these things act together to bring the energy density down. Barbara Rolls is a researcher who is a pioneer in energy density, she sums it up as being all about water, fibre and fat. A Big Mac has a combination of fat, protein and carbohydrates, a bit of water in the bun, a bit of water and fibre in the vegetables, and these things acting together means that actually the calorie density is less than that of pure sugar. I've attached some screenshots of graphs I made at the end. \n\nCalorie density, once you have that under your belt, helps explain satiety (the process of becoming full). As Barbara Rolls has demonstrated with her research people tend to eat a certain weight of food. By adjusting your total energy density by introducing foods with water or fibre (i.e. vegetables), or foods with more water in them (like soups), then you have more 'bulk'. Bulk stimulates stretch of the stomach and causes stretch receptors to fire off saying 'oi, I've eaten something'. The stomach and intestines also sense the makeup of the food and will cause a 'neuroendocrine' response, which means basically your body figures what you have put in. A few points here before I progress, water alone passes through the stomach too quickly to cause these responses, and doesn't fill people up - but in soups you will find the water is adding bulk. This is why eating soups is great for weight loss. When you look at a food like a potato, it is actually great from a satiety point of view, it is not much fat, adequate protein, and high levels of carbohydrates (which from a purely weight loss point of view are not the devils they are made out to be, given there are few calories per gram). Because potatoes come with water and fibre, they add bulk, causing stretch. But if I were to take a potato and cook it in oil (potato chips) suddenly I've added something with no fibre, cooked out the water, and added the densest possible thing there is (oil), so it becomes a disaster for weight control. I've doubled or tripled the calories, but it may actually weigh less now with the water fried out, has less stretch of the stomach and is not good for satiation at all! Barbara rolls did some great research which adjusts the calories of the food people are eating, and observing changes in weight. If you move the calorie density down enough, you can eat as much as you want and you will not put on weight (within reason, c'mon). I've put this in the graph at the end, colour coded. The Big Mac actually made it just into the green but I was too biased, so I changed it to a borderline orange for the second graph - because we all know Big Macs are bad. \n\nSo to top it all off, we have a poster who is reporting a very subjective experience, but one we have all had - overeating. The psychologist Doug Lisle has a great book on the psychology behind our food choices, called the 'Pleasure Trap'. It's not as evangelical as it sounds - it is in fact a very good read. He talks about how we have evolved in an environment of scarcity of salt, fat, and sugar, and now we seek these things actively. Our environment no longer matches what we have evolved to seek - there is an oversupply of cheap and tasty Calorie Rich And Processed food (C.R.A.P. - as the nutritionist Jeff Novick talks about). The problem lies in that eating the 'wrong foods' feels right, and eating the 'right' stuff feels wrong, as least as far as your taste buds are concerned. \n\nSo, in summary, to answer your question, to get adequate stretch of the stomach you need to put some weight of food in it. Fast food can have a lot more energy in it than iceberg lettuce, say. You may be feeling like you have eaten more of the fast food, but have probably eaten the same weight as the healthy food. The healthy food has more water and seems like less substance, so you might think it is less (but that is not what the research shows). You can overeat more easily of foods which don't fill you up (high density junk food, fats), but in the long run people tend to eat a certain weight of food. Changing the average density of food by adding more vegetables and water, and reducing the fat causes a net loss (= weight loss without hunger, as you as satisfying your satiety mechanisms). But there are factors which are working against you (your taste buds and the environment), and you need to keep in mind that these things are really complex, this is an intro of the 20% with the 80% yield. We are social creatures and take cues from the environment around us also. \n\nHopefully that makes some sense. \n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/OqwoM - screenshots of energy density graphs I made\nCheck out: Barbara Rolls (she is prolific, but here is one of her studies) http://m.ajcn.nutrition.org/content/82/1/236S.full\nDoug Lisle - hilarious TED talk - http://youtu.be/jX2btaDOBK8\nJeff Novick - really interesting nutritionist - http://youtu.be/9gTLpTq1nQk\nDr McDougall - if you're interested in the weight side of things, he has lots of articles on his website www.drmcdougall.com"

"The easiest example is the Earth, and maps of the Earth. If you have a map of your city, it is most likely going to consist of lines going up and down, left and right. But it only considers distance as a spatial relationship. It does not consider extra features such as curvature of the landscape which would be a feature of volume. However, the map of the globe, is the opposite. In the globe, lines must bend around the surface. Also, on the globe, we can observe where all the lines of longitude converge at 2 points; the poles. Due to mathematics, there will always be poles on a globe. Anyways, this concept of 2 everlasting poles proves that 2 parallel lines are not actually parallel, under Euclidean theory. Therefore. the two types of geometry go against each other. However, that's okay, because the two forms can contradict each other; its like comparing apples to oranges."
"Translating something is usually a huge series of asking \"what did the people in country A really meant when they said that, and how would people in country B put this in a situation like this?\"\n\nTraslation is a lot about taking the original piece of text in its context and in its cultural meaning, and figuring out what's the proper expression in the other language that works best *in this particular case*.\n\nFor example, if you'd translate *\"Where's the beef?\"* to Finnish, you'd need to first understand what the hell the phrase really means. It's not a less polite enquiry on the location of meat-based food, so you can't just translate that as *\"Missä pihvi on?\"*. (You could just say that the Finns wouldn't ask where the beef is, because they just assume there *is* a beef in a hamburger. They're actually more concerned if the beef is made of 100% Finnish meat. /obviousjoke) So you'd figure out [where the expression came from](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where%27s_the_beef%3F) and try to come up with an enquiry on what's the general point. So the more accurate translation would be *\"Mikä tämän jutun juoni on?\"* (\"what's the real plot of this story?\") or you could just skip trying to find a 100% accurate idiom because there's no real one - if the point of the original question was to imply there's *no* beef, then maybe it could be translated *\"Onkohan tässäkään ideaa?\"* (\"is there an idea behind this?\")\n\nAnd finally, when you make that kind of translation, you also need to take the media and the situation in account. For example, if you're translating a book, you can use long and thoughtful expressions. But if you're making subtitles for a film, you have to condense, because people don't have time to read and comprehend longer passages in subtitles. You'll just have to accept that some witticisms don't necessarily translate well in those situations."

"1) It's essentially a drive to \"socially re-engineer\" society to be more accepting of Marxist thought. This is primarily accomplished through propaganda delivered through the education system, particularly within the social sciences. \n\n2) It relates to political correctness in so far as it has created a culture of intimidation of non-leftist academic thought. Political correctness has the power to paint anyone who disagrees with far-left values as being a racist or sexist. At its core, it's the left-wing equivalent of McCarthyism. Except instead of being accused of disloyalty without regard for evidence, people are accused of being racists or sexists (usually for opposing far-left views that have little or anything to do with race or gender) without regard for evidence of any actual racist or sexist beliefs. Such accusations, even if completely devoid of merit, can destroy a person's career, and as such, cultural Marxism and political correctness have been extremely successful in suppressing conservative academic thought in Western countries.

"When you eat fast food, take 5 or 6 capsules of Metamucil (psyllium fiber) with your first bite. This does a couple of things: the fiber causes some of the simple carbohydrates to be digested more slowly, and it will definitely help with regularity. It doesn't make a bad meal instantly healthy, but it alleviates some of the symptoms associated with a bad diet. (Trivia: Psyllium fiber is also the fiber used to make the glue Mucilage.)\n\nEDIT: to whoever downvoted me, what I said is true, and added to the discussion. If you MUST eat something high in refined carbs, adding fiber to it will help reduce the rate the carbs are absorbed into your system, causing less of a sudden spike in blood sugar--a good thing. And psyllium fiber is one of the best fibers to consume because of its thick, glue-like quality when moist.\n\nWhen do you NOT consume psyllium? If you're allergic to it, obviously, and if you're taking medications, because it can prevent the medicine from being absorbed into your system. (Hint, that very same quality is what makes it good otherwise when you're eating poorly, it helps prevent some of the bad things from being absorbed into your system.)"
"There are two types of entropy. One is information entropy, the other is entropy from thermodynamics.  They're closely related,  but not exactly the same.

"Also, poverty cannot be solved by hand-outs. Plenty of poor nations are very capable of reducing poverty themselves, but many countries are literally paying to keep them poor through farm subsidies, which keep that developed nation's food prices artificially low. If for example Ethiopian coffee farmers, who have an absolute advantage (i.e. they naturally are better at growing coffee, due to their climate and other reasons), were able to roast their own beans when exporting to Europe, they could make a much higher profit, but they can't due to trade laws and must sell their beans raw. \n\nThe same goes for a lot of other farmed products, which grow a lot more efficiently in poor regions, and are naturally cheaper even when taking the cost of transport into account, but are completely undercut by expensive-turned-cheap-by-subsidy produce in Europe and the US. Examples of subsidies include corn in the US and sugar beet in Europe.  It becomes completely uneconomical for farmers in an underdeveloped region to then produce anything. The ridiculous part is: those subsidies come from taxes, which means you're still paying the full, expensive high price of your expensive-to-farm developed nation produce - you can't cheat the economy. The only rational reason I can think of for pursuing subsidies (if we were to assume politicians were rational and not just pandering to farmers) is to maintain control over food supply from a national defense point of view. If that's not the reason for your subsidies, however, then you're just being an asshole. It would be cheaper to give the European farmers a pension for life, stopping the subsidies, and then buying sugar from Africa than what we have now.\n\n"

"It's harsh to say that it is a 'bad explanation'. Sure it is limited in that it relies upon the assumption that time is not an absolute property but instead a correlation between physical properties (in this case the spatial coordinates of the two events). Another way to say the same thing , \"as the Universe ... gets bigger, so this field [time] changes in value\" (Davies,P).  The definition using entropy has a similar weakness.\n\nIf one wanted to argue for the sake of argument, then one could take the line that there is no reason to accept that time is a fundamental property of the universe, it's just a property of the universe whilst it is in a temporary state (after the Big Bang) and that there are other more fundamental properties (and what are they).\n\nIn the real world there is no problem using a definition that relies upon assumptions, and has limitations, as long as one is cognisant of the fact. And then over time (or whatever property there really is that defines the difference between me now, and not now) we improve the definition using hypothesis and experimentation."

For example when you drink a soda which usually has high fructose corn syrup the brain does not register the feeling of being full (this full feeling is usually brought about when simple glucose is consumed) and hence you tend to over eat these junk foods.\n\nA lot of fast foods have certain products with high fructose although I cannot say for sure whether products like burgers from McDonald's do have this high fructose.\n\nHere are 2 links that may be helpful : [Link 1](http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/health/NATL-Fructose-May-Trick-Your-Brain-Into-Overeating--185627871.html), [Link 2](http://www.rosettaradiology.com/blog/?p=347)"
"In one word? Fiber. Fast food has very little of it. Fiber is how you get full and stay full. eat enough fiber and you don't spend much on groceries AND your poop comes out clean (very little wiping). Fiber is the shit. \n\nFlavor and taste buds also have something to do with it. fast food is sugary and salty which obviously is more pleasing to the taste buds, so your pleasure receptors are going haywire on the stuff. Something healthy like celery has little flavor and doesn't stimulate that pleasurable sensation. Theres no \"reward\" to your taste buds."

"I'd say chew time is the biggest factor here. Fast food is so processed that is it easy to chew and swallow very quickly. By \"healthy\" I will assume you are talking about whole foods like fruits, veggies, and lean meats. It takes much more time to chow down on salad greens and grilled chicken breast than a burger and fries. It takes the brain about twenty minutes to register that food has hit your stomach. So, more chew time= more time for the brain to register it is being filled, and you end up eating less. Source: On a special diet and have noticed this phenomenon."

"Let's say you are really fascinated with beets, you decide at an early age (likely high school) that you want to be a beet farmer. You do some research and you discover that it's actually quite difficult to become a beet farmer. Not one to be discouraged, you opt to press on, knowing your hard work and dedication will result in your dream job of becoming a beet farmer. \n\nIn high school, You start volunteering, job shadowing, researching schools, studying for advanced placement classes, and join extra curriculars to strengthen your college app. After four years, and you finally get accepted to Beet Farming University (BFU)'s prefarm program. \n\nAt BFU, you take some of the hardest coursework available and struggle to 4.0 or 3.5 organic chemistry and biochemistry while many of your peers drop out of prefarm to study sociology or engineering. During these four years, you hold down a part-time job, lead your student club, volunteer at the local farms, and do some more serious job shadowing down at the beet research center. \n\nAround your junior year at BFU, you start studying for the MFAT - a cumulative, superfluous test of all you have learned in your prefarm program. Now you have to study for months in advance and hope you get a good enough score to get into farm school. \n\nYou passed! Now on to the next 4 years of med school, 3 years of interning, and 2 years of fellowships, and at 32 years old, you've become a fully licensed beet farmer! Dream come true!\n\nNow, Cletus, from your hometown, he just became a farmhand after his four years at BFU. He thinks he knows a lot about beets! He doesn't...\n\nCletus comes to you because his beets are malnourished and he doesn't know why. He does some research on BeetMD and finds his beets might be victims of a recent famine that broke out in Japan! Never mind that his other beet farmer told him he wasn't taking care of his beets properly! Oh no! Perish the thought!\n\nYou see Cletus this afternoon, and he spends the first 15 minutes talking about his theories. You're patient with him, and gladly offer counsel. You ask him to show you his beets, and find what Cletus's old beet farmer told him was true. Cletus isn't taking care of his beets properly. \n\nYou discuss what he can do to fix this, and Cletus absently nods his head, clearly perturbed that you have the audacity to question his beet farming ability. \n\nNevermind that you've spent more than half your life dedicated to beet farming while Cletus mocks your intelligence with his own ignorance. \n\nTl;dr it's a lot of fucking hard work to be a doctor. You wouldn't tell a beet farmer how to farm his beets because you know nothing about beets. Likewise, you wouldn't tell a doctor how to diagnose you because you know next to nothing about the finer parts of your body. "
"It is perhaps better to think of the energy of an object in the system you suggest as being the energy expended to get it there. If you are raising a ball off the ground, you are doing some amount of work to get it there. That amount of work takes energy. The energy in your body comes from the food that you eat and process and can be converted into muscular movements.\n\nYou cannot measure how much energy the object has in abstraction from the situation in the which the object is in. A battery or a spring would likewise be measured in terms of what amount of work had to be done to give them any potential energy. Without the work put in, there is no potential. We have to go a long way back in time to try and explain the energy present at the atomic level but we can do it theoretically. \n\nSo gravitational potential energy is the amount of work done to move an object against the force of gravity. Depending on the object and the environment, that amount of energy can be converted into several other types of energy if allowed to fall back towards a center of gravity. \n\nThe object itself is not fundamentally any different really. It doesn't pick up any extra measurable qualities. It is in the same state before and after it is lifted. The energy conversion takes place in the displacement - and is not imparted \"into\" the object in any tangible way. \n\n"

Ideal diet is lots of fats (avocados, etc.), meat proteins, vegetables, and low sugar/high-antioxidant fruits.\n\nEdit: and of course, nuts (walnuts, almonds, Brazil, etc).

"In a sense we could.  John Stossel reported on the poaching laws in Africa being nearly useless.  There is so much money to be made from the illegal trade that paying off a few cops and government officials is easy to do.\n\nThen one country tried a different idea.  It essentially transferred ownership of the elephants or rhinos to particular villages near the animal's normal roaming grounds.  The villages could make money off of the tourism since lots of people go there to see the animals.  That gave those villages a vested interest in protecting them, just like a farmer will protect the cow that gives him milk and the chickens that give him eggs.\n\nThey could, theoretically, even sell hunting licenses for exorbitant fees.  But the people aren't stupid.  There is no point in doing that unless the animals are protected and breed long enough to create a population that can be safely culled in limited numbers.\n\nRepresentatives for those villages have reportedly said that they don't kill poachers, but they do beat the crap out of them and make sure they understand there is more where that came from if they ever come back.  I imagine word gets around.\n\nIt's a pretty straightforward calculus.  Pass a law against something profitable and people will violate the law (never ending war on drugs anyone?).  Make it in the personal financial interest of a person or group of people to protect something and they will bend over backwards to protect it."

"But it isn't. That'd be like saying the brain is just a clump of nerves, and it isn't. The spinal cord does function as a sort of highway for nerves and signals, but the spinal cord also serves its own functions too. It contains neural circuits that aid in reflexes and other functions. It doesn't just send signals to the brain either, it can independently control and send its own signals. For example, someone ever tickle you, and you swat their hand away? That was probably your spinal cord. Ever jump when surprised or momentarily frightened?. Yep, spinal cord. It's almost like a second brain in some ways, though nowhere near as sophisticated as our brains. Not even close."

"Part of the reason is that we were once hunter gatherers. If we could find a rare source of sugar, we would gorge on it to put the reserved fat on the body. In a modern western society, where we don't usually worry about where we're going to find our next meal, sugar really has no place in a diet. Not even in moderation (though some of the more antioxidant rich fruits have nutrients not found in other sources, so they should not be forgone entirely). Refined sugar is literally poison to our bodies."
"I can agree and relate to that. I typically only eat in at home with food that I make, if I get fast food or go out to a restaurant (very infrequently because I'm broke/cheap) then my body just feels weighed down from the food. If its something I've made, well shit I can consume about 2000 calories in one sitting."
"There's a lot of fat in the fast food which causes your brain to release chemicals in the pleasure center of the brain that make you crave more, versus healthy food which allows your brain to release the normal hormones and tell you you're full. That's why fast food is addicting. \n\nDon't have a source, but you can google it. Did a paper on it a few years back. "
"There was a similar question in metaphysics: What's that universal language by which a baby learns to walk, animals intract with each other etc. The people who are blind by birth happens to imagine things as black and white shades of the objects they touch or feel. Their thoughts comprise of logical language using these shades as objects(with reference to programming language), the same way as any machine thinks. For example, if blind people touches any hot object say A, they gets a sensation of pain, but when they touch any lesser hot object say B, the paining sensation is then lower. Thus, the usual inference is object B is much safer than A.\n\nMoreover, a thought is a form of self talking that is done via a language known to a person. A language is a way of interacting your senses with other's. When few senses like vision and hearing are blocked there are other senses that will make a language of their own."

"To understand why fast-foods are less satiating, you must first understand that there is no actual technical distinction that can be made between fast-foods and healthy-foods as they are just arbitrarily assigned terms given to assortments of different foods and types of foods. The difference between all types of food is solely dependent on their *macronutrient* ratios (the ratio and amounts of proteins, fats and carbohydrates) and *micronutrient* ratios (vitamins and minerals). \n\nFoods with high levels of protein, fibre and water-content are much more satiating (filling) than foods with high levels of dietary fat. Additionally, the glycaemic index (G.I.) of the carbohydrates found in food tends to also affect satiety, where foods with low G.I. tend to be more satiating than foods with high G.I. carbohydrates. \n\nWhen considering fast-foods, while there is no technical way to define a fast-food based upon its macronutrient ratios, fast-foods do generally tend to be comprised of a lot of dietary fat due to the nature in which they are prepared (cooked in oils and fats, etc.), while also generally being comprised of high G.I. carbohydrates. This means gram for gram, when compared to a 'healthier' meal comprised of, for example: lean meats (high protein), grains (fibre) and salads (water and generally low G.I. carbs), a typical fast-food meal comprised of high levels of fat, high G.I. carbohydrates and low water-content (as most fast-food  items are dehydrated to sustain shelf-life) will be much less satiating.\n\nIt must also be considered that satiation is merely a sensory input driven by the nutritional needs of our body, and therefore eating nutritionally incomplete foods (such as most generic fast-foods), with little to no micronutrients, may hinder our ability to reach satiation. Additionally, fat is the most calorie dense macronutrient gram-for-gram, where it gives 9 calories per gram, as opposed to both protein and carbohydrates which give 4 calories per gram. This means that these fast-foods are generally more caloric dense, enabling us to eat more of these foods more quickly, decreasing the overall sensory exposure to food and therefore decreasing overall satiation.\n\n**TL;DR** fast-foods are generally made up of much less satiating (filling) nutrients than healthier foods. We can also eat fast-foods very quickly as they are very caloric-dense, allowing us to 'fool' our satiation sensory input, ultimately allowing us to eat more. \n"

"I'm a bit late to the party, but seeing as this thread appears mostly to be one giant guessing game rife with maybes and misinformation, here's what I've learned on my long and arduous journey to health:\n\nJunk food is generally very high in carbohydrates and sodium, which increase your appetite and thirst respectively. It has been specifically designed to be as delicious as possible while keeping you as hungry as possible. The high fat content is to make it taste better, but fat and protein are normally the most filling and healthiest things you can consume, so they pile on a massive amount of carbs and sodium to completely override your ability to feel satiated. With healthy food you eat until you don't need to eat any more and then you stop feeling hungry, but with junk food you eat until your stomach is physically filled up to the max (which is uncomfortable and not all that good for you).\n\nThat's why an unsalted steak with the trimmings intact can completely satiate you, while you can eat a couple double cheeseburgers a large fry and a large soda and still feel like you could eat more if only you had the room."

"A judge CAN just overturn a jury's verdict on legal grounds.  Of course, especially in a criminal trial, this usually results in an automatic appeal.  This would happen in the case of a jury returning a verdict that is blatantly in contradiction of the evidence presented.\n\nFor example, the prosecution makes a relatively weak case, the defense offers a sound alibi, but the jury hates the defendant and returns a verdict of \"Guilty\".  The Judge is within his scope of authority to overturn the verdict, practically guaranteeing that it goes to a higher court.  That's his duty as a Judge -- to make sure that the law is applied appropriately."

"Quick answer: Adrenaline (Epinephrine and Norepinephrine).\n\nWhen in a fight, flight, fright mode (Sympathetic Nervous System); the body (specifically the adrenal glands and the locus ceroleus) release catecholamines (Epinephrine and Norepinephrine). These catecholamines enable a shortened state of hyperglycemia (via promotion of glycogenolysis and glucagon release) to give you energy for whenever you are in trouble; a faster heart rate; cause vasoconstriction and vasodilation. This is where the so-called adrenaline rush happens. \n\nWhen this rush happens, your body wants to focus solely on what's important and shuts off anything that is irrelevant in this situation (I.e. digestion, urination, etc). Now the key element in this is the suppression of the immune system. Inflammation is part of the immune system response. I'm not going to very detailed explanation, but basically pain mediators are released in inflammation. These pain mediators help send signals from the site of tissue damage to the spinal cord and then to the brain. The brain is then alerted. This is how your body lets your brain know that something wrong is going on. \n\nUltimately, the catecholamines Epinephrine and Norepinephrine (in short-term stress), causes immunosuppression which then causes inflammatory response to go down which then inhibits pain signaling system.\n\nI hope I answered your question.\n\nSource: a 2nd-year Nursing student\n\n\nEDIT: spelling"

"I actually have an idea here. I was attending a cookware demonstration at my aunts because my parents dragged me to it and the lady was explaining to us why we never seem to stay full from eating fast food compared to a sit down dinner.\n\nIt is because of what we eat. Our body is designed to need different types of food to be eaten so that we feel full. I'm talking the right amount of veggies, starch, meat basically the food pyramid. Most fast food places don't have this so even though you ate loads of it you probably aren't getting the right type of food. So your body is saying I'm still hungry where the real case is I just want some veggies or something. \n\nThat's just about it. "
"You dont eat healthy food when you are high"
"Fast food is comprised of lots of fat, sugar and salt. Those three things provide \"flavor\" but don't require much digestion. Wholefoods, like an apple, are reasonably high in fiber so they take longer to digest. Lots of fruits are high in sugar so eating lots of vegetables tends to be better for you than eating lots of fruit. The more liquid in the fruit, the more sugars, ie. watermelon\n\nI also read somewhere that if you ate 100 grams of fat the body only needs to burn two or three grams of fat to digest and store the other 97 grams. But if you eat 100 grams of protein the body requires 25 grams of that protein to digest and store the other 75 grams. The premise of the Atkins diet.\n\n I'm not recommending the Atkins diet though.

"Consider doing like treycook said and ask /r/askscience but I think it has something to do with the dopamine system. Unhealthy food is like a drug in that it is overly rewarding. It causes cravings the moment you smell or taste it, and you turn into that savage that just wants to stuff his face. Healthy food, while satisfying, will not cause the cravings because it isn't overly rewarding. It will signal to your body that there is food on board that needs to be processed, but your brain isn't going crazy for more. For whatever reason, the calorie dense foods loaded with fats and carbs just taste better -- probably because our body senses they have a lot of energy in them. Evolutionarily, calorie rich foods were not always abundant, so we had to be motivated to capitalize on them when they came around."
"Cells are replicated via a process called mitosis, or cell division.  One cells breaks into two.  During this process the cell makes copies of its chromosomes, with half of them going to each of the two news cells.\n\nGetting an exact copy of the chromosomes requires special tips on the ends of the chromosomes called telomeres.  They protect the chromosome from losing information at its ends, and prevent chromosomes from latching onto each other at the ends.  \n\nEach time a chromosome divides, it gets a little bit shorter because it loses a little bit of the telomeres at the ends.  After enough divisions, there isn't enough of the telomeres left to successfully divide again, and the last cells in that chain dies without ever dividing.  As that process continues over your lifespan you begin to age because there are fewer cells that can replicate successfully.\n\nPossible hope for the future is an enzyme called telomerase.  It lengthens chromosomes by adding the required information to the telomeres, essentially lengthening the chromosomes.  It just doesn't normally exist in most adult cells.  It does exist in human egg and sperm cells, fetal tissues, and tumors.  That seems to be why tumor cells can grow uncontrollably.  Their cells don't age the way normal cells do.\n\nThat at least implies that maybe they can learn to fight cancer by interfering with the telomerase in tumor cells, and maybe they can fight aging by somehow introducing telomerase in a controlled manner to normal adult cells, giving them a renewed lifespan.

"ALL OF YOU GUYS ARE WRONG WRONG WRONG. /rant\n\nMost fast foods are eaten with high fructose corn syrup soft-drinks. What does corn-syrup do? Think. THINK.\n\nIt blocks leptin, what stops you from feeling full. Most fatty foods you take, most people get a soda on the side. Most healthy food at your dinner table, I highly suspect you do not drink it coke, sprite with it. I've tried drinking water with fast foods, and in my opinion it does reduce my intake of foods. I've done a little experiment with it as well.\n\nIt's not only drinks as well, it's their foods. Their food also has formulas to block brain signals that say you're full, such as again: leptin. \n\nEdit: EATING SLOW MATTERS AS WELL. If you eat fast, supplementing water for soda makes no difference at all. Leptin takes 15-20 minutes to register in your brain."
"Fiber. Very simple. "
"The sugar in the fast food interferes with the biofeedback going on between your brain and your stomach.  The sugar effectively prevents one from realizing that they full.

"Here's the short answer: Fast food is engineered very carefully in order to get you to eat as much as possible of it before you feel full. They do this to get you to buy and eat as much as possible.\n\n\nHere's the medium answer\n\n&gt;“They liked flavorful foods like turkey tetrazzini, but only at first; they quickly grew tired of them. On the other hand, mundane foods like white bread would never get them too excited, but they could eat lots and lots of it without feeling they’d had enough.”\n\n&gt;This contradiction is known as “sensory-specific satiety.” In lay terms, it is the tendency for big, distinct flavors to overwhelm the brain, which responds by depressing your desire to have more. Sensory-specific satiety also became a guiding principle for the processed-food industry. The biggest hits — be they Coca-Cola or Doritos — owe their success to complex formulas that pique the taste buds enough to be alluring but don’t have a distinct, overriding single flavor that tells the brain to stop eating.\n\nHere's the long answer http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/24/magazine/the-extraordinary-science-of-junk-food.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=2&amp;\n\nIt's a very interesting article actually and I would recommend you read it if you are interested in knowing about the food you eat and how it is formulated."
"Your question wasn't answered. Check my post. It's all about leptin, I have no idea what these people are even talking about. Simple carbohydrates such as sugar takes 30 minutes to be digested. \n\nAgain, please read my post for the right answer."
"This has 2 big factors.  the first is that there's really not a ton of mass in fast food.  When your family eats, you get big portions of dense foods like meat.  Fast food gives you foods that compact more (breads and french fries, for example).  \n\nBut the biggest piece is that fast food comanies formulate their food so that you can and will eat more of it by combining fat and sugar in such a way that your body has a hard time telling you that you're full from it.  When you're full your body sends signals (stuff like leptin, though that's a bit above and beyond the eli5 idea) to tell you to stop eating and that's what makes you feel like you can't eat anymore.  Fast food is made to either not send those signals or send them slowly so you can eat the bigger costlier portions. it's basically just them using science to further their business model. "
"Fire needs three things to become fire heat, fuel, and oxygen. Water can act to prevent all three from happening, it obviously bring the temperature down, when sprayed in the fog pattern can help choke the oxygen supply,  and can coat the fuel source depending on the fuel.  which is why water will work for would and other combustible solids, but will not work for combustible liquids, Electrical,  and several different metals."
"Because a domain is just a string of letters that's used as shorthand for its real internet protocol address, which is http://194.71.107.80:80/ , and hasn't changed in years. The actual servers the site is hosted on aren't moving, they just buy domains in different countries to point to them. Even if every domain gets seized, you can still use the IP address.\n\nWhen you buy a domain, you're basically telling the domain registering authority to ask the domain name servers to redirect that domain to your servers' IP address. That's all."

Even if we all shared such a valuation, the only conclusion we could reach, logically, from such a premise, is that it is more consistent, *given the specific valuation of the importance of sequencing the magnitude of the values*. But, such an appraisal is no more warranted or sensible than nesting the values in increasing lengths of chronology, instead of ordering them by unit magnitude. In fact, it's less sensible given how people generally account for time in conversation or in concept. Nobody would say or conceive of the calendar date as \"It's 2013, December, the 31st day.\""

"Hmm, why stop them? It doesn't really impact  upon the country of origin for the currency. It may even be welcomed because it makes trade easier, no need to exchange different currencies, reduced transaction costs and so on. If some country decides to buy a heap of US$ from you, and then they wreck all the money, what do you care? You've still got whatever it was they gave you to pay for the US$.\n\nCurrency substitution does occur. For instance, Panama uses the US Dollar although in theory it has it's own currency (the balboa). Other countries in the Americas do also. There would be advantages and disadvantages (wikipedia currency substitution).\n\nWith respect to Greece, if they left the EZ then it wouldn't benefit to continue to use the euro. One of the potential benefits for them to leave the EZ is so they can revert to their own currency, that currency would devalue, this would lower their labour costs with respect to the EZ, they would become more competitive, and their exports would become cheaper. The strong euro is a problem for Greece . There would be the disadvantage that debt repayments would be higher (with a weak currency).\n\nIrregardless of who uses the US$, the only the folks printing US$ is the US Treasury. They still control the money supply and monetary policy."

"To elaborate on this, astronomers utilize something called \"red shift\" to determine our distance from a star. All objects in the universe are moving away from each other (for the most part) and when light gets farther away it shifts on the visible light spectrum to a redder color, so when observing a star for a period of time, you can calculate the change in color of the light with the time observed to find distance.

"You can read the deliberations that the US scientists and military men had in May 1945 over the first nuclear targets [here](http://www.dannen.com/decision/targets.html). The possibility of bombing the Emperor's palace was discussed but dismissed — they didn't want to kill the Emperor and the high command, they wanted to induce them to surrender. They felt the best way to do this was to demonstrate the bomb's power on unbombed targets — the few cities of any consequence that had escaped the ruinous firebombing of Japan. The initial targets that fit the criteria were Kyoto, Hiroshima, Yokohama, Kokura, and Niigata. Kyoto was removed by Secretary of War Stimson himself because of its cultural/religious value. Yokohama was firebombed soon after the meeting so it dropped off the list. A new city, Nagasaki, was added to the final list. The list of targets, by priority, were then Hiroshima, Kokura, Niigata, and Nagasaki. Hiroshima was bombed on August 6, 1945; Kokura was meant to be the primary target for the second bomb on August 9 but cloud cover meant that the secondary target, Nagasaki, was bombed instead. A third bomb was being readied for the end of August. There were rumors that Tokyo might have been its target but all atomic operations were halted on August 10th when it became clear that Japan might be ready to surrender."
"I think there's two things going on here.\n\nCalories come from carbs, protein, and fat. Within carbs, there are dissacharides (table sugar), fiber, and complex carbs. McDonald's is full of two of the types, but not fiber, which is what fills you up.\n\nAlso, McDonald's and fast food is loaded with sodium, which makes it addicting and makes you want to eat more.

"When you borrow money you are simply selling bonds (essentially IOUs) promising to pay it back with interest.  That doesn't inflate the currency in and of itself.  It just gives you more debt to pay in the future.\n\nWhen you print money you are increasing the total number of dollars, which reduces the relative value of each dollar.  It can inflate the currency, though they try to do it in a controlled manner to reduce that effect.\n\nIt should be noted that banks create money out of thin air all the time and that can also have an inflationary effect.  Most money doesn't exist in the form of currency.  It only exists on bank ledgers.  The total number of dollars in the form of bills and coin is only about 10% of the total dollars that exist on bank ledgers.\n\nBanks run a sort of controlled shell game whereby they loan out more money than they actually have on deposit.  This works because not everyone runs to the bank and takes their money out on the same day.  (If they do, it is literally called a Run on the Bank, and no bank ever has enough cash to pay all of its depositors).  But they work this shell game well enough that it keeps on working, and it does help the economy grow faster by amplifying the amount of money that can be borrowed.  It *could* all come crashing down if enough bad things happen, but it's not very likely.\n\nOther countries do the same thing.  Which means that the money we borrow from another country can theoretically be money that only exists on the other country's bank ledgers.\n\nSupposedly some very bright people keep this all running smoothly, but thinking about it does make it hard to sleep some nights."

"&gt;The first New Year's Eve celebration in Times Square was held on December 31, 1903; The New York Times' owner, Adolph Ochs, decided to celebrate the opening of the newspaper's new headquarters, One Times Square, with a New Year's fireworks show on the roof of the building to welcome 1904. Close to 200,000 people attended the event, displacing traditional celebrations that had normally been held at Trinity Church.[50] However, following several years of fireworks shows, Ochs wanted a bigger spectacle at the building to draw more attention to the area. The newspaper's chief electrician, Walter F. Painer, suggested using a time ball, after seeing one used on the nearby Western Union Building. Ochs hired sign designer Artkraft Strauss to construct an electrically lit ball for the celebration; it was built from iron and wood, lit with one hundred incandescent light bulbs, weighed 700 pounds (320 kg), and measured 5 feet (1.5 m) in diameter. The ball was hoisted on the building's flagpole with rope by a team of six men. Once it hit the roof of the building, the ball was designed to complete an electric circuit to light a 5-foot tall sign indicating the new year, and trigger a fireworks show.[51] The first ever \"ball drop\" was held on December 31, 1907, welcoming the year 1908. In 1913, only eight years after it moved to One Times Square, the Times moved its corporate headquarters to 229 West 43rd Street. The Times still maintained ownership of the tower, however, and Strauss continued to organize future editions of the drop.[52]\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Times_Square_Ball#Beginnings_.281907.E2.80.9319.29"

"It is simply because healthier foods have nutrients that your body actually wants and needs. Whereas fast food are essentially empty calories; fats, salts but zero nutritional value. Although there are some they are few and far between. Therefore, your body is trying to absorb as much as it can from those empty calories, so you eat more of it. "
"I'm guessing that it's because real food has nutritional value and your body says it's full because it's getting the nutrients it needs with less food intake. Junk food however has less nutrients and more salt &amp; sugar. Therefor you eat more of it to get same level of nutrients. The salt and sugar just cause you to keep feeling hungry. "

"Flash storage is extremely complicated in how it works, a d I don't fully understand it myself-at least not enough to explain it to someone else. I'll leave that for another user. However, the basics are that it has no moving parts. Normal storage, ie: a hard drive, has one or more metal platters with a head that reads them sorta like a record. That means the platters have to spin, and the head has to move, and it takes time for the head to move to a different area of your hard drive. That's why defragging hard drives is useful. Flash storage doesn't have those moving parts, so any area can be accessed without slowing down. Thus \"solid state\" drives. Flash _tends_ to be faster than conventional storage, but its no guarantee, so always check the r/w speeds. Also, the lack of moving parts makes them usually last longer (though not forever) and make them smaller, so they are ideal for smartphones."

"Anorexigenic signals are stimulated by the presence of fat and protein, but the pleasurable reward system can stimulate one to continue eating these foods in spite of that. This is especially a problem for overweight people dieting.  If you only try to reduce caloric intake, the hypothalamus reacts by sending orexigenic signals with anxiety signals. High fat and protein diets are excellent anxiolytics, which is why eating disorders and obesity are so common.  So you can eat a ton of fast food because you are being positively stimulated to do so.  "

"The \"pins and needles\" feeling is called \"paresthesia\" and is most commonly caused by awkward positioning of your body which puts pressure on a nerve and/or cuts off the blood supply to a certain area of your body. This leads to a \"falling asleep\" sensation in that body part which is very similar to that of anesthesia - the nerves stop sending messages to the brain. When you change your position and restore blood back to the area, it gradually awakens and you get the \"pins and needles\" sensation which is brought about by those nerves \"awakening\" and resuming sending their messages to the brain.\n\nParesthesia can also be brought about by certain medical conditions and pinched nerves."

"Not likely. It is possible that a method of beheading might cause a pressure spike in blood pressure forced into the brain that would rupture blood vessels and perhaps damage tissue but even several aneurysms would hardly be an issue in such a short period, especially considering the catastrophic drop in blood pressure."
"First, you need to understand that fast food isn't food at all.  It's a food-like product (In fact, all processed foods are really just food like products). I'm taking a stab here and would need a doctor or cellular biologist to validate my assumption. Basically, your cells use fat from your food to replenish their cellular membrane.  the cellular membrane looks like this: http://www.biologymad.com/cells/cells.5.gif.  You notice how there are two layers of what look like balloons with strings or lollipops? Those are lipids with the 'strings' being fatty chains. When you see hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated anything in ingredients, it means vegetable oil has been treated with hydrogen to chemically change the molecular state of the oil (basically for long shelf life, cheaper to use than animal fats, etc). The problem is when your body uses hydrogenated fats for cellular membranes they don't work very well.  Instead of looking like a lollipop or a balloon with a string, the lipid's fatty chain is zig-zaggy like Charlie Brown's T-shirt. This makes all the cell walls of your cells much weaker and your body craves more fat intake to reinforce the cellular walls lipid layer. When you eat healthy, this does not happen. Now, this isn't the only reason why you felt full after eating healthy, just one reason.  "

"The brain is the center of consciousness, it's where you experience all of your feelings and sensations. When you are decapitated, your brain is severed from the rest of your body, meaning it can no longer feel past your neck, but it is still alive immediately afterwards meaning it can probably see/hear/etc. However, the brain is a huge consumer of blood and so because no blood is being supplied to it anymore and in fact is being drained out extremely quickly, it loses consciousness in a matter of seconds.\n\nEDIT: The reason this happens is because the nerves supplying the eyes and facial muscles are called cranial nerves and are located on the brain stem, which is not damaged during decapitation. But because the lungs are removed and the vocal chords are most likely gone, there is no speech."

"Based on a great documentary on food called \"Forks Over Knives\", I think it has to do with the amount of oils in the food and how they take the shape of your stomach instead of filling it up and expanding it, like say rice would. There are receptors in your stomach that tell your brain it's reached capacity if its stretched, and oils do not stretch the stomach, letting you gorge on fatty foods without feeling full. "
"It has to do with your body breaking down complex carbohydrates vs simple carbohydrates. Fast food would be considered more of a simple carb. The mechanism of a simple carb is obviously more simplistic than a complex carb, therefore simple carbs are easier to break down which means you don't stay full as long as you would if you ate complex carbs."
"They explained this in the documentary \"Supersize Me\", I'm not sure of the specifics right now but I'll try to be as clear as possible and elaborate more later...\n\nFast food is high in various artificial ingredients which can actually trick the stomach into thinking that it wants more food even though it's probably full (I believe the culprit to this is high amounts of MSG).  This is a primary contributor to weight gain and obesity.  Healthier foods (such as fruits and vegetables) don't contain the artificial ingredients that fool the stomach, so your stomach truly knows when you've had enough to eat.\n\nI'll try to find the specific section in the documentary and update/improve this explanation."
"The reports may not be accurate.  According to this [article](http://science.howstuffworks.com/life/inside-the-mind/human-brain/10-brain-myths6.htm) what people reported as voluntary movement of the eyes and facial muscles may have been random electrical activity after death.\n\nObviously without the heart pumping, blood is not forced out of the brain.  But that also means that the blood which remains there is no longer under pressure.  Consider what happens if you stand up too fast and your blood pressure fails to increase quickly enough.  You start to go black almost instantly.  That anecdotal observation suggests that the 2-4 seconds of consciousness mentioned in the article is probably the most you could expect."

"Probably not. It would depend on the length of time that it took to behead. With a katana/guillotine, I'm assuming the cuts were clean and fast, meaning there would be no difference.

Then as you gradually sober up your brain activity is less and less depressed, becoming more active, and waking you up.\n\nSo you don't wake up from being *sober*, but you just have less alcohol in the system then the massive amount that caused you to pass out. Your brain isn't as depressed, it becomes more active, you wake up still kind of drunk.\n\nNo idea if correct, but I heard it somewhere and it made a bit of sense at the time"

"Ok so not to be like \"you're wrong\" but the process for falling asleep is actually kinda long. As you lay down and close your eyes your brain slows down its processes and shuts down certain parts of your brain so they can rest and regain energy. And it's at this point i'm starting to forget the mechanics. I'm pretty sure that your vision center begins to send signals to your motor center to make your eyes seem heavy so you close them. Damnit i wish i could explain this a little better.\n\nAs for part b of your question, you can be going through the stages of falling asleep while doing other things. If you're watching a movie and then turn it off and fall asleep it crosses alot of wires. Your visual center is firing but alot of your other sense are like \"Hey go to sleep so we can too!\" So once the stimuli is gone your brain is like \"Ok everyone go to sleep now\" Even though some parts are still taking their time shutting down (like your visual center) so then it feels like you're awake when really you're about to fall asleep. So that feeling really just comes from certain parts of your brain still running while you're trying to sleep. "

"Im going to go out on a limb and say it has to do with two things: nutrient density, and hydration. Fast food, is low in nutrients but high in energy, and often comes packaged in a way that reduces air and moisture content for preservation purposes. Thus, you can east more fast food because of physically less water filling you up. Also, being energy dense, your brain and body will crave more of it, as a survival mechanism to gorge. Its pretty instinctual for homo sapiens.\n\n'Healthy food' as I'm imagining as raw fruits and vegetables, are very nutrient dense, low energy dense, and very high water content. Because it is low energy density, your appetite doesn't crave eating more in the same way you would a Big Mac. Additionally, the increased overall water weight of the food will trigger your satiety faster. It has been proven that overall more water before and during a meal will trigger the feeling of \"fullness\" faster.\n\nHope that explains."

And that's not considering the effects of salts, sugars, fats, added chemical bs, etc. \nThis is a basic rule to follow with weight loss - eat real food. "
"The fact is that in the english language it would be more prudent to remove a few letters. All of the phonetics required in the english language could be produced with fewer letters than we have in our alphabet. An alphabet which covered every phonetic instance in english would be far too expansive for practical purposes, so going in that direction would be a bad move.  \nOn top of this, technology has had the effect of causing us to use less language to convey more information, ie: roflmao. So it seems that the tendency of our culture is going to be to simplify language, not expand upon it. Unless you include technical language. That will likely increase even as much of our language simplifies. "
"After reading some comments, I think there isn't only one answer to this question. It think it is a number of things from nutrient density, types of macronutrients (fat, protein, carbs) and their affect on Ghrelin (hunger hormone), and involvement of fiber with carbs. Possible simple answer: Probably because of the amount of processed carbs that you're eating at once. The same kind of thing that makes your insulin shoot up, feel abnormally hungry, gain fat mass, and cause damage with inflammation build-up=processed carbs. Great book to start: Why We Get Fat by Gary Taubes. And check out Mark Sisson at Marks Daily Apple. Very scientifically literate guys who may drastically change your thinking on nutrition."

Reading over many different books, we have found that, without getting into the nitty gritty stuff, fast foods are designed to have very little nutrients to them. Your body needs a certain amount of nutrients, so you need to eat more fast food, which is great for the companies that make the food because then you buy more, causing them to get more money. Healthy foods have so many nutrients jammed into everything, you need to eat less because you get so much more. "

"Desire for food comes from 3 things. Blood sugar levels and 2 hormones leptin and ghrelin. \n\nWhen we crave, ghrelin is released and tells us we are hungry.

"It's complicated.  In College physics with simplifying assumptions, even the smallest difference in frequency can be resolved.  In the real world, it depends on the medium (copper in this case), how sensitive your transmission and reception technologies are, how good your filters are, how strong a signal you can send out, etc.  \n\nThe limiting factor right now is probably in filter design, to select a frequency, you have to have a [Band Pass Filter](http://iub.edu/~emusic/etext/synthesis/chapter4_filters.shtml) for the appropriate frequency where the distance between cutoff frequencies is the minimum resolution between channels.\n\nImagine your car radio, which operates under the same principles.  The broadcast is usually very tightly controlled with a narrow bandwidth so you only send out exactly what you want.  The receiver is a tunable antenna and filter which is somewhat less effective.  If you pack the frequency spectrum up to the limit, people with less effective (cheaper, older, etc) receivers are going to pick up stations bleeding over into each other.  The practical interaction of these is what determines the acceptable resolution.\n\nOf course, a lot of that has gone away with the switch over to digital.  Digital transmissions use various [modulation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulation) schemes to use the same frequency to transmit much more information.  Most of the modulation is focused on transmitting more information over the open airways, but it would apply to a copper cable as well.\n\n"

"Hi there, the answer is actually much more simple than you would think it is! The tongue has three major nerves in it, but the two that are of greatest significance to your question are the *Glossopharyngeal* and the *Chorda tympani*. When you eat food with a high salt/fat content your taste buds can sense the content and release tastants (chemicals that stimulate taste receptor cells). The receptor cells in turn stimulate the *Chorda tympani* which gets the body ready for the meal that is coming in by inhibiting other nerves, inhibiting pain in the tongue, sinuses, nasal cavities, esophagus, and so on.  The *Glossopharyngeal* is what gets the body actually ready for the meal through constricion of blood vessels and contraction of muscles through the head and neck. Since you are eating something that is not that big of a meal but has an insane amount of calories, salt and oil, your body is being tricked into thinking that it is about to gorge on a massive feast. When the meal hits the stomach though, receptors in the stomach tell the *hypothalamus* that the stomach still has room. So now since you are already in binge/feast mode from the receptors in the tongue all you can think about is what's next down the pie-hole.\n\nHope this helped!\n\n**Source:** UNC"

"Section 5 of the VRA creates a \"preclearance\" requirement on states and local governments that have had a history of racial discrimination in voting laws. This means that states with a preclearance requirement must seek approval from the US Attorney General or 3-panel body made up of judges from the District Court in DC before they are allowed to change voting laws in order to ensure they are no longer discriminating against minorities.\n\nSection 4(b) lays out the formula used to determine which states and local governments are subject to preclearance. *Shelby County v. Holder* (2012) laid out that the formula used in section 4(b) is unconstitutional as it exceeded congresses authority under the 14th &amp; 15th Amendments. \n\nIn laymen terms section 4(b) is unconstitutional because Congress can not base the formula on data that is close to 40 years old at this point. States can only be subject to preclearance based on a standard that is relevant now, not a standard that may have been true in the 60's. \n\nBecause section 4(b) was found unconstitutional and Congress has failed to update the formula, section 5 was essentially struck down in practice.

"Ah! My degree will pay off now! Ghrelin is an fascinating hormone the originates from the stomach. The reason why it is so fascinating is it treats your body as if it is fasting. So what? Well... if you are in fasting mode, you are hungry, you want all the high caloric food and as much of it. That cheese burger would be much more satisfying than a low calorie salad. This has become a problem in the US because the more fast food we eat, the more tolerant our ghrelin levels become and we actually need to eat MORE to lower this fasting hormone. Once we eat enough,  our levels drop and it tells our brain \"hey its cool, we are going to live so no more food.\" Yet it takes longer for ghrelin levels to drop so it can send this message, therefore we indulge more in high calorie foods. \n\nNinja edit: I am on my phone, would be  happy to site sources later."

"That antisemitism was partly a product of Jewish leadership of the German Communist movement. Communists organized a bunch of uprisings and strikes during the interwar period that were seen by many as economically destabilizing. Since much of the Communist leadership was Jewish, and they revered Karl Marx (another Jew), many Germans came to see the Jews as responsible for ideologically driven attacks on an already struggling economy. The National Socialists took advantage of that perception to attack the Communist Party, which was one of their chief political threats, and which held an ideology that was fundamentally incompatible with National Socialism. That culminated in Hitler taking advantage of the Reichstag fire and purging the government of Communist influence."

"Actually, that is not true. Water has a much higher specific heat than air, meaning the heat transfers much easier between you and the water.

"Because healthier food tastes like ass"
"I asked a very similar question in my nutrition class about a year ago. This was the answer I received from my teacher:\n\nHigh fat food, and high fat ingredients, are ALWAYS more desirable to is. We have taste preferences developed from evolutionary need for fat stores. We developed from species that were highly skilled predators, and very resourceful gatherers. We have never been large or powerful animals. This means we need fat (slow burning fuel with a high Calorie concentration) to sustain us in between meals. There is still a primal aspect in your palette that tells you to load up on fat and sugar (I'm simplifying, but this ELI5) for fuel storage. Ask the sciences for the role the ATP cycle plays to further expand on this. The body converts most everything, after extracting necessary nutrients, to fat. Obviously, taking in fats means less work for us on a cellular level. "

"I've been \"committing suicide\" for over 2 decades! "
"I think there are two things at work here. One is generally true, and one is related to you in particular.\n\nThe first thing that is generally true is related to caloric density and satiety. Satiety from food is usually achieved by volumetrically filling your belly. Vegetables and other whole foods have a pretty low caloric density and will make you generally make you feel full without a lot of calorie intake. Foods (especially salty foods) with high caloric density are at least mildly addictive. That's why you tend to crave more burgers, fries, and soda. Your body craves the calories and salt, but your stomach is sending you a mixed signal that you aren't actually full yet. That's why if you normally hit somewhat healthy meals but then switch to fast food, you'll need a lot of fast food to feel full.\n\nThe second issue is that you may have a disorder. Three burgers + extra is a tremendous amount of food for someone of your stature. I am not a doctor but I strongly suspect you have hyperthyroidism if you are able to eat that much food regularly without much activity and retain that weight. I am not sure that hyperthyroidism is intrinsically dangerous, but at very least it may cause you to crave bad food that will greatly hurt your health and longevity."
"The Chinese prefer hot water. So, there you go."
"Because fast food is less filling, whereas healthier food tends to be healthier albeit far more filling.\n\nTake for example broccoli, beans, lentils or cauliflower. These are foods that fill you up pretty good.\n\nA bit of bread, a bit of meat, some cheese slapped on it isn't filling at all, and it's desired, so you'll buy even more fast food."
"&gt; If you will still be responsible for 100 percent of your medical bills, why should you have to pay the extra fee?\n\nThis is really the issue. A great many people do not have health insurance, but because we are unwilling to refuse medical treatment to those in need based on inability to pay, a portion of the uninsured are not responsible for their medical bills and the costs get passed to others. Furthermore, the uninsured tend to not have affordable access to health services, so they are much more likely to wait until medical conditions worsen before seeking emergency care, which is much more expensive and produces worse medical outcomes. Waiting until you are ill to get medical insurance is like waiting until your house is on fire to get fire insurance, if everybody could do it, then the system would fail because there wouldn't be enough people overpaying into the system to pay for those who are drawing from it."

The baby was totally different before we left the building. A few more treatments helped even more. Finally the baby could sleep alone.\n\nDon't tell me this is placebo, that doesn't work on infants.

That makes the whole thing more curious since cable companies transmit the local channel's signal (at the cable company's expense) which pushes the local company's ads to a potentially wider audience.\n\nEven stranger is that in many areas the cable company is *required* *by* *law* to carry the local channels, even though they may be forced to pay for them.\n\nI'm not an expert, but I'd be pissed at the company that owns the local channels.  It is essentially highway robbery.  They should ban laws forcing cable or satellite providers to carry local channels."

"There are many things going on. Firstly, on a subconscious level, you need immune system compatibility. We are constantly emitting pheromones which are odorless chemicals that influence our behavior unconsciously, and gives off information about ourselves. This is the defense mechanism that keeps us from mating with our own relatives, for example. When someone is compatible with us, we feel a greater amount of attraction to them.\n\nThis attraction is consciously perceived through a whole host of chemicals and hormones that are released. Among these are Phenylethylamine, or PEA, which is a stimulant that causes that \"butterflies\" nervous feeling when you are attracted to someone. Oxytocin is released and this causes emotional bonding to the individual, especially during sex and orgasm. Then, there is dopamine, which is a neurotransmitter that is released and creates a feeling of reward. Dopamine is at the root of all addiction, and so when you are in love with someone, you are literally addicted to them like a drug.\n\nThere are more, but these are the basics. Of course, when people say two people have \"good chemistry,\" they are referring to other things as well such as a compatible sense of humor and personality, etc. But those are just some of the biological processes that occur during \"love.\""

"Your brain picks up different signals to orient your body and to balance yourself. Your eyes and your inner ear pick these signals up. In the car, your inner ears tell your brain that the world is moving around you in a certain way, depending on the car's movement. If you look at something stationary in relation to your body, your eye, on the other hand, would send the signals to your brain that the world around you is standing still. The mixture between these two types of signals cause the motion sickness.\n\nYou can experience the reverse by sitting still in a chair and watching something that looks life-like moving (e.g. the first-person view of a video game), where the eyes would tell the mind that the world is moving, but your inner ear tells your mind it's standing still."

But then they would get in their cars, go to work and school. They would see the roads are still there, the sun still rises, their workplace is still there, they are still getting paid, they can still use their bank account, etc. Then most of them would figure nothing had fundamentally changed and accept the new, abstract notion that they have a new government. Does this mean things are better than before? Of course not.\n\nThere is a parable taught about increasing degrees of evil. How do you cook a live frog? You don't boil the water and throw it in.

"The estimate you get from google is based on someone driving the speed limit over the suggested route.  It can also take into account things like current traffic and weather conditions.  \n  \nThe fact of the matter is that unless you are driving a relatively large distance, speeding doesn't actually get you there all that much faster. So the estimate is still fairly accurate.  \n  \nLet's say for example that you are driving 20 miles to work.  Let's also say that 16 of those miles are on the freeway. We will also say that you drive 25% faster than someone who is following the speed limit. \n  \nThe equation we use is Rate * Time = Distance.  \nBut we want time so we will be using time= distance/rate. This will get us fractions of an hour. Then we multiply the result by 3600 to get the time in seconds. \n\n**Driver A drives the speed limit:**  \n(2/35) * 3600 = 205 seconds to get to the freeway  \n(16/65) * 3600 = 886 Seconds on the freeway  \n(2/35) * 3600 = 205 seconds to get to work after exiting the freeway  \nSo we have a grand total of 1,296 seconds.  Or 21.6 minutes.  \n\n**Now for driver B driving 25% faster**  \n(2/44) * 3600= 163 seconds to get to the freeway  \n(16/81) * 3600 = 711 Seconds on the freeway  \n(2/44) * 3600 = 163 seconds to get to work after exiting the freeway  \nSo we have a grand total of 1,037 seconds.  Or 17.2 minutes.    \n  \nSo if everything went perfectly (you hit every green, no slow drivers, etc) you got there about 4.5 minutes faster than estimated. Still well within an acceptable error margin.  Also, it is pretty unlikely you would hit the best case scenario.  You would also need to be driving 25% faster the WHOLE route.  No slowing for lights, offramps, slow traffic, traffic jams, police, etc.\n  \nThese estimates also get updated by google as they receive data about how long a specific route ACTUALLY took.  Then they use mathematical algorithms to adjust the estimates based on historically how long it actually takes people to travel on those routes.\n\nEdit: Updated to the correct equation.

"It really has close to nothing to do with protein. You are correct, however, that fiber and carbs are the main suspects. It's important to note that fats bind and trigger a signaling pathway from the small intestine to the stomach and brain letting you know that you are full and regulating the release of food from the stomach.\n\nFiber acts in a similar manner by slowing food release from the stomach (by increasing digestion time) and also by helping move material through the intestines so that it isn't maximally absorbed. \n\nSugars, on the other hand, activate pathways that often result in increased consumption of food. This is because your body wants to store the sugar as a source of energy (and can do so much quicker than fat), so your body essentially says \"keep eating, I'm gonna store this energy, so you need to eat more to make up for your energy requirements today.\""

"NOT an ELI5 response but here you go:\n\nI would hypothesise it is because of the satiety response associated with carbohydrates and also the activation of the mesolimbic reward pathway in response to high calorie and fatty foods which encourages you to binge.\n\nBasically, McDonalds uses fructose in it's products as its main carbohydrate (I think). Fructose doesn't fit into the receptor which causes an insulin response and therefore hormones such as ghrelin are delayed in their release thus delaying the \"I feel full\" response. Also, your body almost archives and stores the information of certain foods and its energy content. Notice how when you're hungry, you don't fantasize about eating foods like salads? You want to stuff your face with burgers and fries and pizza etc. This is because there is more energy in these foods thus you feed more efficiently and because more dopamine is released.\n\n"

"My 2 cents, just based on experience.  \n1st theory\nThe speed you are eating.  At a family gathering you are sitting down at a table and talking, probably you spend 30-45 minutes eating your food.  Probably also you've been eating finger food for a little while before you eat.  My guess would be that when you eat your fast food, you scarf it all down in &lt; 5 minutes.  If you cut up your cheeseburger, and burrito, ate it with a fork, while talking with your family, you would most likely get full with a similar amount of food.  \n2nd Theory\nFast food is extremely calorie dense.  A super size fries has around 600 calories, and weighs 198 grams (~6 ounces).  A similar serving size of mashed potatoes with butter and milk has about 237 calories.  Your body is programmed to take advantage of this calorie rich food.  It wasn't that long ago evolutionary time speaking, that we weren't easily able to find as much food as we wanted any time we wanted.  So when we find it, our biological programming says stock up and take advantage of our current situation.\n\nSo probably some combination of the above."

"The reason can eat large quantities of fast food is because most of it is empty calories while healthy food has more vitamins, micro nutrients, and good things for you body.

Such a period can have a duration of several decades. Take the Eisenhower area, for instance, when time was so slow that most people just died from sheer boredom. It was not until the late 60ties when it began to speed up again.\nToday we are in a HIPAP high pace period, therefore your impression of time running faster and faster is actually quite right."

"There are two major mechanisms two feeling full. The first is related to macronutrients (protein, fat, carbs) and the second is related to volume.\n\nMacronutrients cause you to feel full differently, known as satiety. The most satiating macronutrient is protein, followed by fat, followed by carbs. Carbs that are natural (rice, potatoes) are more satiating than processed carbs (sweets, chips, etc). When you eat fast food you are consuming a lot of processed carbs. Having some burgers and fries you getting a lot of those calories from bread and fries and less from the protein and fat whereas with a healthier meal you will get a higher ratio from protein and fat. This is why a lot of diets recommend cutting out processed foods, you eat more nutritious foods with more vitamins and minerals and you unconsciously lower calories consumed because you feel full faster. \n\nThe volume response simply has to do with the amount of food consumed. If you consume a large volume of food, your stomach will stretch a bit and signal that you are full. This is why a lot of competitive eaters train by binge eating to stretch their stomachs so they can eat more. "
"Millions of connections from all over the world all at once. \n\nImagine if u were McDonalds.  You have 4 cashiers taking orders.   Normally there's a small line of 10-15 customers.

When one of them gets to the cashier, they don't order, they just stand there holding up the line.  So you ask the person holding up the line to leave.  They leave, only to be replaced by another protestor.   You can't tell who's a protestor and who's a real customer.  Real customers are getting angry and leaving the line.  The protestors don't care.\n\nThat's essentially a DOS attack"
"I think the reason this doesn't have more upvotes is because he put all fats into one category.

Certain fats are incredibly satiating, coconut oil and (grass fed) butter being two. They are both also very healthy. I'm not going to look it up because I'm on my phone, but the health benefits are way enough to research. Olive oil is also healthy, but in my experience not as satiating. They're high in calories, yes, but there's a challenge on Youtube showing how hard it is to eat a stick of commercial butter (which is not nearly as healthy or satiating as grass fed). There are other fats that are healthy, and more that are unhealthy in varying degrees. \n\nTL;DR not all fats are created equal. "

"A DDoS attack is simply caused by flooding a companies servers with so many requests that they can't do anything other than try to deal with the influx of requests.  \n  \nFirst off you have to know that requests made over a network to a computer have a \"Time To Live\" that is essentially how long the request is valid until it expires.  This is put in place so that a computer won't sit waiting for a response for the server forever.  You can assume that if the request hasn't been answered in X amount of time it probably isn't going to be. When a server is saturated by a DDoS attack, most legitimate requests will timeout and never be served.  \n  \nThe way a DDoS works is you take a whole fleet of computers and you have each computer hit a web address (let's say www.google.com in this case) as fast as they possibly can.  However you write the software making the request so that it doesn't actually wait for a response.  These requests are called [Half open requests](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_half-open).  The idea here is that you bury the servers in so much traffic they cannot sort the junk from the real requests.  \n  \nImagine that your business is mostly handled via mail orders.  Someone fills out a form, mails it in with a check, and you send back the product. But you have to do this within 24 hours of receiving the order. In this situation a DDoS would be achieved by going out and hiring say 25 people.  These people are paid to do nothing but stuff an envelope with a blank order form, fill out the envelope, and put them in a cart to be mailed out.  These people work 8 hours a day doing this.  Every day you are getting literally *THOUSANDS* of pieces of mail, but you have no way to know if a piece is a legitimate order or a piece of junk. So now you are wasting all your resources sifting through all the junk mail, and your legitimate orders are expiring."

"The wild cow (AKA Aurochs) is extinct--the last specimen was killed by hunting in the seventeenth century in Eastern Poland.  Feral cows are not unknown (they've become a nuisance in Chino Hills State Park in California), but are relatively rare due to the cost of beef--generally, ranchers are unwilling to let their herds get away and form wild populations.  In the old days, cattle would be allowed to roam generally free, with a brand, but would be rounded up for slaughter or sale.  \n\nWild (and feral) horses are present in North America and the steppes of Asia--the Przewalski's Horse is an endangered subspecies native to Mongolia, for example.  \n\nHorses and cattle both prefer open grasslands, but cattle will live in forests if their preferred habitat is occupied by humans and domesticated herds.  \n\nGenerally, domesticated cattle are quite terrible at surviving in wintertime--which is another reason you don't hear about them.  They won't try to break through ice on a river or pond to get at fresh water, or to scrape snow to get at grass--horses will use their legs for that, but cattle won't bother.  "

"First off, you're constantly exposed to bacteria.  Things you touch, rub against, or wear can have bacteria on them, and transfer them to the skin.  Hormonal activity in teens produce what those bacteria like for food, mostly oils.  Faces in general are more oily to begin with, and it's worse during those developing years.\n\nFor the face, it's a constant struggle.  Showering and extra face washing (after eating or exercising for example) can help a lot.  Regular and frequent cleaning of pillow cases can reduce breakouts over night.  If you face transfers some bacteria to the pillowcase, and you treat and scrub your face that day, when you go to bed, you can transfer bacteria back to your clean face from your contaminated pillowcase.  Same with clothing or bed sheets for body acne."

It's not slow to go down but tastes fowl if rancid and burns if fresh.\n\nI also ate a stick of butter once. I had been on low carb for several months and wondered if i could, in fact, just eat butter. Thanks to my adaptation away from sugar, it tasted extremely sweet. Would reccomend.\n\nOne thing I have not seen yet is [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yo3TRbkIrow)\n\nBasically, refined carbs bork up your natural mechanisms for keeping full. Insulin \"steals\" calories, causing you to think you've eaten less than you have. Further, it blocks leptin - the hormone that tells you that you are full. \n\nAlso, yes I know that we say it's calories in vs calories out. That's only in a closed system, which humans are not. I am trying to hunt down a man who hate 5000 calories low carb and lost weight. He is a brit that did a series of videos. \n\nI am not discounting other aspects of chemistry. Fat does taste good. Somewhere there's a study that says that carbs AND fats taste better. So don't forget that people smarter than us are paid more than us to make junk food irresistible!\n\nLastly. On low carb, I found that flavors really began to \"pop\". Everything tasted better after about 2 weeks. \n\nEdit: ketones also replenish executive function. Your body just has to switch to using them as a fuel source. 3-12 days at less than 100 carbs a day should allow them to do so. "

"&gt; It must also be considered that satiation is merely a sensory input driven by the nutritional needs of our body, and therefore eating nutritionally incomplete foods (such as most generic fast-foods), with little to no micronutrients, may hinder our ability to reach satiation.\n\nNot at all. The satiation of a food has nothing to do with its micronutrient content, although this isn't the first time I've heard this trope. It only happens that foods which are low in micronutrients also have that which makes food filling stripped out. \n\nNatural foods are indeed more filling than fake foods, but this has more to do with the fact that we evolved to survive on these foods, not highly processed fake foods. Natural foods that are \"high\" in carbs have fiber that mediates the insulin response, which is the only semi-decent thing about fiber. Foods that are highly processed (almost invariably adding grain to the mix somehow) don't have anything to slow down that insulin response, which makes that processed food particularly unsatisfying.\n\n&gt;This means that these fast-foods are generally more caloric dense, enabling us to eat more of these foods more quickly, decreasing the overall sensory exposure to food and therefore decreasing overall satiation.\n\nThis doesn't really mean anything. Yes, foods high in fat are more calorie dense, so this necessarily means you will get more calories per gram of something that's high fat compared to something that's not high fat. That doesn't mean that overall satiation is less, it just means you might happen to eat more in one sitting. I've been eating all meat for the last year, and yes, I would be lying if I said I've never eaten 3,000 to 4,000 calories in one sitting more than once. \n\nIf you subscribe to the oversimplified energy balance model of weight control, you would assume I was on a fast track to becoming even more obese than I was when I started trying to lose weight. This totally ignores what happens a few days later -- I don't even WANT to eat. I go 24 hours without eating. Not because I made a conscious effort to not eat, but because I just wasn't hungry. My appetite is all over the place, even outside of those instances where I eat a huge amount at once. Sometimes I eat a lot, sometimes I don't. \n\nYou have to separate the effect of dietary fat on our metabolic system with the effect of carbohydrates. I would agree that foods high in carbohydrates and fat are especially insidious, but it doesn't mean dietary fat is bad, should be limited or isn't the best way satisfy an appetite. It's only when you have high levels of circulating insulin (from carbs), insulin resistance and leptin resistance that you create a nice cocktail for weight gain if you eat a lot of fatty meat without limiting your carbohydrate intake.\n\nThat being said, I don't know how you can get that much more healthy than a burger without the bun (cheese &amp; bacon is fine), a salad (Ranch dressing is fine) and a water for the price. I'd agree fries drenched in vegetable oil and a coke is about as unhealthy as you can get, but it's not the fat that's the problem. "

"One thing people fail to realize, is that the USA does use both systems.  Packaged food weights are listed in both oz or g, lb or kg.  Liquids are often listed with both  oz/gal or mL/L.  Nearly all nutritional data is in metric, Calories, grams, milligrams.  Speedometers (and digital odometers) for automobiles list both mph and kph (and miles and km).  Parts on vehicles made be either American Standard or metric.  Engine displacements are often listed as both cubic inch and liters or only as liters.  Many thermometers and scales list both AS or Metric.  Scientists and engineers primarily work in SI.  \n\nAs a final point, the USA got 12 people on the moon using American Standard and some metric.  No Metric-only country has gotten a single person there, yet."

"Dogs tend to lick other dogs and their owners as a sign of love and respect. When they were puppies, they were cleaned by their mothers by licking and they were stimulated to breathe by licking. They grow up knowing licking is a way of communicating with others and expressing love and if they have puppies when they're older, they'd be doing the same to their own. \n\nThere's also a connection between licking and food. When a puppy licks their mother, the mother would feed them. There's also other reasons such as licking releases endorphins which make them comfortable and happy.\n\nDogs can also be licking themselves if they're in pain, bored, anxious or if they have skin sores."

"Imagine bending a single wire into a shape. It can be bent into many different shapes. Some shapes have many small bends and some shapes have only a few large bends. The important thing is that I can make an unlimited number of shapes even if some only vary slightly from another. Suppose I wanted to say your name with this wire. I could bend it into a handwritten representation of your name. That would require many small bends and a long wire. Alternatively, I could replace each letter in the alphabet with very slight and small bends that are nearly indistinguishable, but still different. Then I could use a shorter wire and it would take less work to write your name but it would be harder to read. So if I make your name very easy to write with a short amount of wire it will be very hard to read. If I make your name easy to read it will either take a lot of work making small bends or a very long wire. It is desirable to use as little wire and as few kinds of bends as possible. That makes more room for all our friends' names on the big wire. Yay!"

Plus there might be appetizers or what not.\n\nNot to mention, you're with other people who may not eat a lot or don't want to eat with, so there may be some social cues as well. Could also be temperature. Restaurants tend to be cooler because they know people eat more when it feels cool. There are other stimuli that makes you want to eat or not.

"Each channel that is used is 6 MHz wide, starting at channel 2 (54 MHz) and goes up to currently 850 MHz which is the upper band limit that most distribution amplifiers can handle to extend transmission distance.  Each channel at 256 QAM can handle approximately 36 Mbit/s and each standard definition channel fluctuates between 1 and 4 Mbit/s and each high definition between 10 Mbit and 14 Mbit/s.  As compression algorithms become more advanced we can cram more information into the digital bands.  This was also one of the major reasons to get rid of the analog channels.  The spectrum was already packed with as much information as they could and once the analog broadcast requirement was removed CATV companies could replace a single channel with one program with 10 programs.  This also made more room for internet traffic where DOCSIS 3.0 is able to bond multiple 6 MHz channels together.  Example, 4 256-QAM channels could break the 36 MBit/s barrier with 144 MBit/s"

"Five year old version: my attempt...\n\nCoaxial cable carries many radio frequency channels at once, with very high quality and consistency. The same thing could be done over-the-air but the quality due to interference and losses would be very low. Also over-the-air has other users and purposes so it must be shared. Coaxial cable signals are completely controlled so it is very stable, and only needs to be shared by customers of the same service.\n Just when you think \" how many users can possibly use the same signals on a coaxial cable?\", another clever design has divided neighbourhoods into smaller areas so that Internet traffic doesn't get overloaded. This makes certain that capacity can always be expanded to meet any needs of the customers. Each neighbourhood gets a similar set of signals, but each are specially designed for each area. \n\n\nThanks to clever international standards, the digital signals carried over coaxial cable have tremendous capacity, and can do many things simultaneously. Some signals are for TV channels, while others are for Internet download and yet others for upload information.   The equipment in the home only needs to tune to the correct channels and everything works. "

"Insulin does not promote satiety. [Insulin spikes increase appetite and feelings of hunger as well as amplifying the perception of sweetness](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3894001). \n\nSatiety is affected by fiber, protein, and volume. Protein provides [much more satiety than carbohydrates](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18469287). As does [fiber](https://conservancy.umn.edu/handle/52609). Satiety Index creator Susanna Holt explains the relationship better than I can:\n\n&gt;\"Roughly speaking, the more fiber, protein and water a food contains, the longer it will satisfy. But you have to look at each foodstuff individually—and that is why we think our index will be so useful.\"\n\nPotatoes have significant impacts on satiety because they're large and full of fiber AND have slow-moving complex starch carbs. Steak and potatoes together provide protein, fat, complex carbs, fiber, and a large volume of food, which delivers a bicycle kick to one's satiety. Complex carbs don't spike insulin levels as much as simple carbs, so potatoes don't have that counteractive force on satiety that, say, a hamburger bun (simple carbs) does. \n\nIt is because of this relationship that OP feels full when eating wholesome meals but hungry when eating fast food. Fast food has poor macronutrients, simple carbs, almost no fiber. The protein is there in some fast food, but protein cannot compensate the hunger-inducing effect of simple carbohydrates and MSG, both of which spike insulin. Meanwhile, a hearty meal served at a family dinner generally has enough variety to include fiber, protein, and complex carbs. \n\nTo add to that, [humans seek salt like addicts](http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/News/2011/July/18071102.asp). It is scarce in much of the natural world, yet we need it to function. MSG and high sodium content in fast food (and junk food for that matter) increases appetite. "

"I'm going to minor in nutrition, so from my understanding of the matter, fast food is easier to consume in large quantities because of how much fat is in it. Since most of it is deep fried, more fat gets added in and fat has a low satiating effect. So if you eat a supersized order of fries, it won't feel like you ate that much. However foods high in fiber (Carrots, celery, salads) are more filling because our bodies don't fully break down the fibrous foods, thus the regular BM after eating a healthy meal. \n\nAlso, a word from the wise, don't try to start eating twice the fiber you used to after this thread for a better poop schedule, it will constipate you if you eat too much fiber foods.

"[mm is measuring focal length.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_length) I can't answer this question to it's full potential, but I can at least tell you what you probably want to buy and some pointers.\n\nThe lower the mm, the wider angle the lens is. 18mm (standard minimum on most included lenses) will capture more of the area. 250mm is zooming in very close. The cheapest zoom lens for most DSLRs is a 55-250mm lens, and that covers a very wide gamut of zoom power and will most likely satisfy your needs. (The only issue is these lenses tend to have very high chromatic aberration toward the edges, but photo editors can remove this.)\n\nSo, the general rule is: higher mm = more zoom power, lower mm = less zoom power.\n\nEDIT: If you want to avoid having to swap lenses every time you want zoom, you could plunk down on something like an 18-250 lens (which would cover everything from having a very wide field of view to being able to get up close with something), but those tend to run a *lot* of money."

"The unit of measurement for radiation is rads. A rad measures the energy from a radioactive source. Just like how a lightbulb emanates heat, radioactive sources emanate  radioactive energy.\n\nThe accumulation of rads in an organism is considered \"radioactive contamination.\" The best example I can think of about the effects of radioactive contamination is alcohol. If you drink one beer, a small amount of alcohol, you probably won't experience any effects. The same goes for rads; a small amount of contamination won't produce effects. But if you take 10 shots of vodka, you should start to have lessened motor control, slurred words, and you risk blacking out and causing brain damage (this all depends on your size and alcohol tolerance though). The same process applies to radiation; a small dose might cause some mutations in a gene or two. A bigger dose might change the entire phenotype (physical characteristics) of a cell. An even bigger dose could mutate enough genes so that the cell can't reproduce, or it performs apoptosis (a safety precaution cells undergo when they detect too many mutations which basically is cell suicide). If a few cells die, you're probably not gonna have any problems, but if a big enough dose of rads kills a significant amount of cells, you die.\n\n"

If the food you eat isn't giving your cells the nutrients they need, you will still be hungry.

"There are 2 basic things that cause appetite suppression.  One is your stomach being full, the other is the blood going into your liver having calories in it.  Both are important for suppressing hunger, and I believe either one can override the other (though it's been awhile since I studied this stuff)\n\nI think for your scenario, the answer probably lies more in how full you are going into that scenario.  For family gatherings of my own, I'm often munching on chips, beer, and other things before the main course is served.  While there may be some light activity going on, mostly I'm just sitting around talking.  So I've been feeding myself small amounts of calories for the liver, and my stomach is already moderately full.\n\nHowever if I'm going for fast food, it's usually because I've spent the day running around constantly, and don't have time to go cook something.  I'm usually haven't eaten in quite a while.  So my stomach is very empty, and my blood is probably very calorie deficient as well.\n\nIt could still have something to do with the food itself, but I think that's a breakdown that would have a much smaller impact on suppression of hunger than the environmental &amp; time based scenario I laid out above, and would probably happen a good time after anyways."

"I think I can help a little. It all amounts up to the types of food you consume on these occasions. For instance I can eat 10 cheeseburgers at McDonald's in one sitting but cannot eat more then a plate of Christmas dinner.\n\nFor my family we have huge meals with tons of varieties of foods. Always at these dinners there is mashed potatoes or some other form of potato. Eating high starch foods expand quickly in your stomach and cramming other food on top of it quickly causes you to fill your stomach way before your stomach realizes your full. We are actually supposed to eat a lot slower then what we actually do. Our stomachs naturally expand slowly on there own. We all eat faster then this reaction can occur and end up gorging ourselves. \n\nI can't give you a 100% accurate (I know what the hell I'm talking about) but I remember this back in my biology class from high school.

"healthier foods tend to have higher fiber and protein contents. foods high in fiber, such as oatmeal, take longer to digest and move through GI tract. Oatmeal is often recommended as a good breakfast because it stays in your system for a longer amount of time, therefore keeping you full and providing you with more energy as you start your day. \n\ninterestingly enough, foods high in fat also immensely slow down the digestive system. Fat stays in the gut for a longer amount of time, and is not water soluble, which means it has to be emulsified (broken down) into smaller pieces in the intestine, and transported across the intestine membrane via lipoproteins (cholesterol). \n\nWhat's curious is that theoretically, foods high in fat should be filling, and would probably be harder to digest than something healthier like oatmeal for instance. However, research has shown that [junk food is addictive](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2402746/Food-addiction-DOES-exist-Junk-food-activates-region-brain-hard-drugs.html), and activates the same brain structures that cocaine or heroine do.\n\nIn short, to my knowledge junk food should be just as filling, perhaps even more, than healthy foods. Maybe the reason we can gorge ourselves on junk food is because fat is just so darn delicious, and apparently addictive."

"&gt;Because of the shape and dimensions of the anamorphic lens, more light is gathered from around the sides of the foreground subject. This is why the background looks vertically squashed but the subject appears to be normal.\n\nI don't think you understand what an anamorphic lens is. It does not gather light from around the sides of a foreground subject in any different way than a spherical lens does. An anamorphic lens is literally nothing but a spherical lens with a cylindrical lens attachment on the front or sometimes integrated inside the lens to squash the image horizontally. _That is literally all it is_. There is nothing special or magical about it that causes it to render perspective in a remarkable way like you're suggesting.\n\nThe reason the background bokeh is oval-shaped in your sample image is not because the background is stretched differently from the foreground. _It isn't stretched differently_. You would see the exact same effect on your subject, except that your subject is in focus and the \"ovals\" are thus too small to notice. It's because the front of an anamorphic lens is shaped like a cylinder and not the side of a sphere like a... spherical lens. It's a very simple effect and you can actually get bokeh in whatever odd shape you'd like (hearts, ovals, squares, triangles, etc.) with a very simple process: http://www.diyphotography.net/diy_create_your_own_bokeh\n\nAnamorphic elements are always set to infinite focus, meaning they do not blur the image at all that they are passing through to the spherical elements, at any depth, at all, no blur, no depth of field, meaning none. They have _no effect_ on foreground vs. background or anything. They result in different bokeh because the front of the lens is physically shaped differently, and it has nothing to do with the wider perspective. You can get the _exact same effect_ with spherical lenses if you want. Depth of field in anamorphic lenses is a result of the spherical elements, not the anamorphic. By design.\n\n&gt;you actually get much more horizontal information than vertical\n\nThat's in fact precisely backwards. Because the image is squashed horizontally to fit onto the image plane (film negative or digital sensor), you must stretch it out horizontally to regain the proper proportions. This results in _less_ horizontal information per pixel, by definition.\n\nLook none of this is very complicated but you seem to have a first-year film student's understanding of optics."

"Rape is defined as sex that's initiated without someone's consent, so there could be forced object penetration or not.\n\nWithout going into the details, if the man doesn't or can't consent (age, intoxication, etc) then the woman is committing rape.\n\nIn application, however, it appears far less likely that a man male would report this type of sexual assault, for whatever social or personal reasons.

"It does work to some extent, just not in the ol' US of A.\n\nThe problems are strategic voting and that the two leading parties are too firmly entrenched. \n\nIn many cases people will have a choice between a party they like (maybe the greens) a party they feel neutral towards (democrats), and a party they really don't like (republicans). While one might want to vote for the party they like (Green), they know this party has almost no chance of winning. If they vote for the party they like, they'll be throwing their vote away, and it becomes more likely that the party they hate (republicans) will win. So they vote for the party that is more likely to win (democrats), even though it isn't that closely aligned with what they want, to keep the party they hate out. This is called strategic voting. Strategic voting prevents small parties from ever collecting enough votes to be a serious contender.\n\nThe other problem I mentioned was that the two mega-parties in the states are too firmly entrenched. Their campaign budgets are orders of magnitude bigger than the other guys', and they receive such an overwhelming share of the popular vote (due mainly to strategic voting) that the other guys never seem like serious contenders, and probably never will unless something changes.\n\nAt this point, it seems that the US would need a major overhaul of their electoral system to oust the two-party system, but it's wildly unlikely that this will happen\n"

"I strongly disagree.  The idea of market capitalism which is the bedrock of Republican policies is built on a winners &amp; losers philosophy.

It provides opportunities for people to better match their skills and abilities to work and unleash creativity. \n\nIt is implicit in that theory that there are losers as well as winners.  The Republicans believe that the long term effects of market capitalism bend the arc of society upwards; there's a general societal benefit that accrues to everyone as the system functions.  Losers recover, and try again (as many times as necessary).  Winners are buffeted by the gale winds of creative destruction and either adapt or fail (to rise again when they find new solutions to current problems.) Since this matches observable reality, it's a philosophy with strong adherents.\n\nThe Republicans want a \"free market\" for healthcare.  They have no answer for how someone who can't afford it gets it.  They want the benefits of the free market, but they don't want to address the downside: sick people without access to care.

"Except the police don't get \"free stuff.\" The confiscated material goes to the state or federal government which then auctions or sells it off for the highest prices possible, the money of which go into the state or federal coffers.\n\nCops see little individual benefit from these seizures, unless they themselves are partaking in **illegal** activity. \n\nBeyond this, police can't legally seize and keep material that has not been used in the commission of a crime or in some way been purchased by the spoils of a crime (such as a drug kingpin's house).\n\nAnd FURTHER, the people who continue to make the laws regarding the war on drugs are not police officers, but, rather legislators. And as we have seen, the war on drugs is being dismantled primarily by **local and state legislatures** who do not see it as a benefit to keep throwing resources at something that is not particularly a problem and doesn't present significant gains.\n\nThe war on drugs is a continuation of a conservative, quasi-religious, puritanical approach to government in America. It is a detriment in every way and a burden on the police, the prison system, and the court system. It is based solely in an idea of what is morally acceptable, not what can generate the most profit. (The legalization of drugs would benefit the state more through taxation and the consumer through the quality and variety of product.)\n\nExcept for the DEA, whose task is solely to fight the war on drugs, no one really benefits from drug prohibition except for the criminals."

"It starts from the general observation that any signal is compromised as a sum of sinusoids at different frequencies. In a wire containing multiple frequencies, you have to detect a certain frequency using a bandpass filter, which only allows certain frequency signals to pass through. So if you has a 100kHz and 110kHz signal superimposed with each other, and you run that through a bandpass filter which allows 95khz - 105khz frequencies to pass through, then only the 100kHz component will pass through and the 110kHz will be rejected."
"I honestly have no idea how how government managed to fund things before the income tax model was implemented. But since income tax has been the model for this many decades now I don't see much point in debating it too strongly. How you were parted from your cash a hundred years ago doesn't seem to matter too much to me. The point IS that they still got your dollars. Maybe they didn't take quite as many of them back in the day. We got along just fine without dozens and dozens of government funded programs, right? Who needs things like interstate highway systems, airports, federal and state parks, USDA inspectors, CIA, FBI, EPA, NSA, PBS, TSA, FDA, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, I could go on and on and on and on and on. My point is that these programs, while not equally important to everyone, have still manged to improve our way of life in countless ways. Some could argue that all government programs are simply socialism and evil and if that's your position well then by all means keep on supporting the politicians who've managed to frighten you for this long.\n\nFines ARE motivation, same as are prisons and jails. Not sure why you're dragging the whole gay marriage issue, or immigrants, or cultural things like \"ebonics\" into the discussion.

I somehow picture you back in the 1860's upset with the government for forcing you to give up your right to own other humans.

"This is a function of [wave physics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave)\n\nTake sound, for example. Sound is just a wave pattern of air pressure. High sounds are high frequency patterns, and low sounds are low frequency patterns. The loudness of a sound corresponds to the amplitude of the wave - how strong the air pressure waves are. \n\nThe reason that you can hear a high and low tone at the same time is that the waves can add on to each other without interfering with each other. This is called [superposition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superposition_principle). Your ear drum vibrates along with both the high frequency wave and the low frequency wave at the same time, and you perceive it as hearing both a high and low tone.\n\nThe same concept applies to electromagnetic radiation - analog radio waves, cable signal, or light. A band pass filter is what allows a listener to only receive information on a particular frequency. It eliminates frequencies other than the ones you want. \n\nWith sound waves, a band pass filter would be like having noise cancelling headphones that only allow certain tones through.\n\nedit: added more information"

"As far as I'm concerned it's about the \"sugar\" or mono vs polysaccharides. The (preprocessed) food industry likes to use a type of sugar that pretty much bypasses the insulin response similar to how alcohol works. Meaning you can have a lot of it without feeling full, because your organs won't detect that you're actually full until your starting to expand your belly. Meaning a physical response rather than a chemical one, albeit you can't tell the difference because it's your human brain doing the interpretation on both and it doesn't seem to have developed different sensory functions for this. If you use normal sugar, as in what healthy foods has, it'll trigger an insulin response which will tell your body that you are content.\n\nThe reason they use this is because it's cheaper. They neglect the health risks because it pays more. The bad sugar that creates this problem is called corn syrup. And I've seen one documentary where a guy tried to link it to the fat epidemic in the United States.\n\nTake my information with a pinch of salt though. I'm just saying what he was saying.

It saved us 2 bytes that we could use for something else.\n\nAs we approached 2000, some computers would represent that date as 00, not 2000, which could be interpreted by the computer as 1000, 1100, 1200, and so forth, and since many systems depend on time/date to determine what should be done, this would/could cause conflicts in and of systems.\n\nFuture proofing systems is always hard, because it's hard to project where things will be going. Standards change and performance improves, so something that's top of the line and everywhere now, may be obsolete and unused 10 years from now.\n\nIn the case of this question, at the time the systems were developed, the space savings was more important to the engineers than was the idea that 30 years from now, this may not work anymore."

Also, Stalin wasn't entirely competent--he was enamored with the old Russian Imperial myth that you could make virgin territory profitable for the state by seeding it with random citizens until they make a city, which led to some of the more pointless wastes of trained citizens in the Gulags, where trained engineers would die of exposure and starvation while attempting to build a collective farm in the swamps of Siberia.\n\nBasically, it's not a flaw of socialism that makes it fail as a government system--it's confirmation bias on our part in that Communist governments tend to occur only in the most war-torn parts of the world, because comfortable workers don't feel like rising up and shooting the bankers."

Nutrients is what gives you the feeling of being full because it gives your body more of what it needs. Try getting a bunch of different fruits/vegetables and juice them, you will feel much more full after a large cup than a McDouble. \n\nTL;DR : you feel hungry from fast foods because they do not have as much nutrients as some \"healthy\" foods and the nutrients are what makes you feel full."

"Ok, the engineers out there might hate me, but this is an ELI5, so try not to be too analytical.\n\nIt's a bit different for digital and analogue, but digital is a bit easier to explain I suppose.\n\nSo, we know that with a digital signal all of the information is encoded in a series of ones and zeros, or \"on off\". It's like flicking a light switch really quick to send morse code.\n\nSo, let's say that you want to send a message, and each light flick represents one bit of the code. So you start to flick the light on and off once a second. It takes you 1 minute to send your message.\n\nWell, if you want to send a *second* message at the same time, then you can pay attention to the 1 second gap between bit-signals in the first message. What's happening in that gap? Nothing. So let's use it!\n\nSo now we have two signals going. Each one with a 1 second gap between bits of the corresponding signal. Now you can send *two* messages in one minute. But this poses a problem - to someone just looking, it looks like the lights are flickering *twice a second*. The message makes no sense! \n\nWhoever is trying to read the messages needs to know that there are two signals, and that they are alternating. So every other flicker needs to be ignored.\n\nSo, when you want to send more than one signal on the same line, you pick a particular frequency for your message, using the gaps left between other signals. You tell whoever is listening which signals are on which frequency, and ignore the rest. Without knowing which time signature you need to listen for, it just looks like a crazy amount of noise, but if you know what the frequency is, then you can isolate your message. By overlapping the signals this way, you can transmit more than one signal over the same wire at the same time."

"This question comes from the book A Fault in Our Stars, by John Green. It's based on an assumption by the heroine, Hazel, who is a 16 year old girl. The author's statement on the situation is here: http://johngreenbooks.com/questions-about-the-fault-in-our-stars-spoilers/#hazel\n\nCopy-pasted below:\n\n&gt;Q. You once mentioned that Hazel’s views on infinity was incorrect. Can you elaborate?\n\n&gt;A. Well, Hazel is just flat wrong about infinity.\n\n&gt;The infinite set between 0 and 1 is actually the same size as the infinite set between 0 and 2, so Hazel is technically incorrect.\n\n&gt;(It is not easy to succinctly explain why this is, although this site does a reasonably good job—there, the example used is the set of positive integers being the same size as the set of all integers, but it’s the same principle.)\n\n&gt;However, Van Houten is right[1] when he says that some infinities are bigger than other infinities. For instance, as proven by Cantor’s diagonal argument, the infinite set of real numbers is bigger than the infinite set of natural numbers.\n\n&gt;So Hazel takes Van Houten’s correct observation and makes an intuitive but incorrect conclusion from it, albeit one that provides her with real and lasting comfort.\n\n&gt;The idea there was that I liked that 16-year-olds could make—as they do—incorrect abstract conclusions about complex mathematics. But even if these conclusions are incorrect, they can provide real and lasting consolation. I felt like it would be too neat/tidy to have everything be correct; I wanted her to make incorrect inferences from Van Houten’s monologue that still guide her thinking in a correct/helpful direction.\n\n&gt;[1]I am not a mathematician, but I tried my best to get this stuff right. I don’t mean ‘think’ in the sense that this is the kind of thing you’re allowed to have opinions about. You don’t get to have an opinion on whether .999… is equal to 1, for instance. It is equal to 1. People smarter than us have worked hard to figure this stuff out, and we owe it to them and to the universe to respect what they’ve figured out.\n\nThis is just speculation on my (/u/medyomabait) part, but my guess is that the author would want the readers to puzzle it out for themselves and reach their own, technically incorrect but still meaningful, conclusions.\n\nEdit: formatting"

"Again, you're simply upset with HOW that dollar manages to escape your wallet. You're just not understanding that it doesn't matter HOW. The point is that you still ended up funding the system. You may as well fund a potential good program (ACA/Obamacare) as opposed to a bad one (the current healthcare mess). The ACA is hardly perfection and may not even be \"good\", but at least it's a nudge in the right direction (universal healthcare). I think we'll get there someday. Much sooner if people didn't support the idiots screaming about the evils of socialism.\n\nExcise taxes and tariffs are still paid for by all of us. If you purchase a product produced in your country you paid extra in order to pay the excise tax. Maybe not directly, but believe me, you still paid for it. Same with tariffs. The cost was passed on to you somehow. Property taxes are the same. Makes no difference whether you actually own property. If you rent your house/apartment or business, you still pay/paid the property taxes. Again, maybe not directly, but your landlord still managed to remove it from your wallet so that he was able to pay. It makes no difference how things were done a hundred years ago. Today we fund our government and the programs we as a society have decided are important mostly through \"income taxes\". I don't see much point in getting upset with that fact."
"This is the scientific, research-supported answer:\n\n- Unhealthy foods have a lot of calories, and weigh very little. You can eat more of them, and still have room for more. On the other hand, healthy foods have less calories, and weigh a lot. You can eat less of them and be full quicker. When you become full your stomach will send a chemical (called cholecystokinin; COLE-ee-sis-tuh-KIE-nin) to your brain telling it to stop craving food; that chemical will be sent to the brain upon the stomach expanding based on a large volume of food. Healthy foods have greater volume, hence you \"get full quicker\" (read: your stomach sends the chemical to your brain sooner).\n\n- What gives the healthy foods their greater weight (which is what satiates)? Water primarily, as well as fiber and/or protein. Coincidentally, water is zero calories, hence healthy foods satiate you and also counteract a high-calorie diet.\n\n- You can test this by taking any food and dividing the calories by the grams, per serving. Unhealthy foods will give you a higher number; healthy foods will produce a lower number. The lower the number, the healthier *and* the more satiating that food is. You can use that simple equation for anything and the lower numbers will always point you to the foods that satiate better.\n\nIf I can clarify anything, just let me know; happy to dialogue on the science behind this. This response is but a very concise summary.\n\nSOURCE: Numerous academic studies.

"Yes, most viruses are just a string of genetic code. Nothing programs it, but they exist because their code just so happens to make their hosts produce more of themselves. If they didn't do that, they wouldn't exist. They don't really have a specific purpose, although we can use the properties of a virus to accomplish certain tasks. I know it's hard to conceptualize how something can do that without being alive, but they exist because they can self replicate, and you don't need to be alive to do that.\n\nEDIT: Let me try to use an analogy. A woman sitting at a computer is following a set of instructions which tell her to copy and paste those instructions and send them to everyone she knows, who will then do the same thing, kind of like a chain letter. The people are the cells in your body, and the instructions are the virus. The instructions are just words on a screen and aren't alive, but it is essentially replicating itself through the computer users. If people stopped paying attention to it, it will \"die.\" If someone changes the instructions to say something else, then it will also \"die.\" Does that make sense?"
"That's because we are predispositioned to this by our heritage as a hunter/gatherer species. We gorge on fruit because the sugar will give us fat stores to prevent death in the event that we can't find any nutritious food for our next meal (which might take some time). So we love the taste of the sugar and our body just wants more and more. So to keep ourselves alive, our body tells us to eat as much as is available.\n\nIf you're going to be eating loads of fruit instead of vegetables, meats, and nuts, then you're going to have some trouble maintaining a healthy body. All that fruit is just basically candy. Maybe you should stop thinking of food as a treat, or something in which to take pleasure in, and rather a fuel to maintain your body--I know it's a harsh way of thinking, but it made me happier once I was over the hump. If you think you have a high constitution, this may test it. I had no trouble, but I psyched myself into realizing food is just a fuel. By the time you've been off of refined sugar and reduced your fruit intake for a month, eating a pastry or something sugary will actually disgust you. It's kind of amazing.\n\nAnd as far as pesticides go, it's cancer that should be worried about. The longterm effects.

You need a highly experienced person (called a mahout) to take care of elephants and they are incredibly sensitive creatures that will bolt and trample everything around if mishandled. In India, where I live, being a mahout is a privilege not open to everyone. It's an occupation passed down from generation to generation that very few people can actually grasp.\n\n\n(4) The fact that these are endangered species makes them highly protected and vulnerable. Their poor numbers make it too much of a risk to expose them to environments outside the heavily guarded boundaries of a sanctuary.\n\nSource: From what I have seen and understood.

"No you are absolutely correct that the signals are summed, *however* the filter will only let the parts of the wave that fall in the filter's passband through. \n\nIf you have a 90 kHz wave, a 100 KHz wave and a 110 kHz wave all superimposed, you will indeed have a mess of a signal. However, passing this through a filter with a passband say in the 100 KHz range, will result in ONLY the 100KHz frequency component being extracted. So despite there being interference from the 90/110 kHz waves, you will only get the 100 KHz component that you want. You wouldn't see anything from the 90/110 KHz components because they are outside the filter's pass band, and thus attenuated away. \n\nThe concept is similar to how a Fourier Transform is able to pick out the various component sinusoids in a signal,[ this website explains in detail](http://betterexplained.com/articles/an-interactive-guide-to-the-fourier-transform/)."

"It was a printing convention in the 15th-16th centuries (Gutenberg built his press in 1450); making new typepieces was a laborious and time-consuming process involving filing down a piece of lead *by hand* until it looked like the letter (though casting copies of one once it was done wasn't, thanks to a method he invented); early printers tried to find ways around having to invest time/money into making new typepieces by figuring out shorthand methods. One of these was to use a rarely-used letter, y, in place of an actual thorn or eth character. This freed up a \"t\" and an \"h\" to be used in other words when setting the type. As printing technology improved, this convention began to lapse.\n\nThe other aspect is a holdover from the Middle English period where the germanic verb prefix \"ge-\", once common to Old English, began to fade away. By the time you get to Chaucer (a couple generations before the printing press) the \"ge-\" had evolved into a \"y-\" which could be used or not used depending on how much a writer wanted to play around with the sentence structure. Chaucer mostly uses it as a way to change the stress on a verb to make it fit the meter.\n\nedit: [Would you like to know more, with the help of Stephen Fry?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6KmzuULPmQ)"

I asked this question to a nutrition teacher in a class I was taking, and she explained it like this:\n\nYour body craves nutritious food that it can use to replace, repair, and rebuild all the gazillions of functions throughout it. It needs lots of vitamins and minerals to do the job. If you fill it with 'void' food, it will automatically start to crave more food, hoping that you'll give it something it can work with. This is why you can put away a ton of junk food, and then be just as hungry an hour later. Your body is actually just trying to get you to give it the nutrients it needs to get shit done. Hence the vicious cycle of craving food, eating junk food, and then craving even more food minutes later. \n\nMade sense to me, but I don't have any other evidence besides that explanation from my teacher.

Also, consider this. When you're thirsty and you drink water, your body is able to recognize that you're fulfilling its request for hydration. With food, it's much more difficult. Your body has to break down the food you're eating. Once your body is satisfied with the amount of food in your stomach and the amount of nutrients it's able to extract from the food, it tells you that you're full. Because of the lack of nutrients in fast food, this process takes a lot more food. Your body may even say you're full because of the amount of food in your stomach despite not getting enough nutrients. This is why you may get hungry again in a relatively short amount of time; it wants some more nutrients."

"So, I work for a health and nutrition company, and I wanted to answer your question about why you get fuller faster when eating healthy as opposed to junk food.\nLet me give you a scenario: \nIf you sit down and eat a small bowl of fruit salad, you get full (which we already know) But you can sit down and eat a whole bag of family sized potato chips and still not feel satisfied. \nYour body doesn't really get full off of calories. Granted, it does need calories to survive, but the reason the human body needs so many calories is because of all of the nutrients and vitamins that food provides for you; that's why we eat is so that our bodies get the nutrients. Makes sense, right?\nSo back to the table. If you eat a bowl of fruit salad, you're getting WAY more vitamins and nutrients that your body is going to say \"ALRIGHT! WE'VE GOT ENOUGH NUTRIENTS! EVERYTHING ELSE WILL BECOME WASTE!\"\nAs opposed to the potato chips where your body will say \"This is NOT enough nutrients! Keep eating more so we can get all of the nutrients we need!\"\nThis is why If you want to lose weight, you can eat healthier food and inadvertently not need as many calories in your diet, but still be fully satisfied and healthy.\n"

However, in English, the sound became a \"y\" sound so that the Germanic *eage* became eye, *dæg* became day and so on.  At one time, though, through, night, knight did **not** contain silent letter (think of Monty Python's Holy Grail where the French soldier calls Arthur's men Kuh-nig-uts--he's just saying \"knights\" phonetically.

"The molecules in hot water are moving faster than molecules in colder water, so they bump into the dirt and other such particles much more often, leading to greater interaction with them and thus making hot water easier to clean with. The use of soap is a bit more complicated. Basically, each water molecule has one side that is slightly more negatively charged than the other side (likewise, the other side is more positively charged). We call this property polarity. Water therefore likes to interact more with other particles that are also polar. Most oil-like substances are *not* polar molecules, and so water doesn't like to play with them, making them hard to clean off. They *do* like to interact with other non-polar molecules, though. So what do we do? We use soap. Soap is a weird molecule. It consists of a \"head\" that is polar and a \"tail\" that is non-polar. When we apply soap to a oily substance, the tails of the soap molecules bond with the molecules of the oily substance, leaving the polar heads exposed. We can then apply water to the oil/soap mixture and the heads of the soap molecules bond with the water molecules, thus creating a bridge of sorts between each water and oil molecule, allowing the oily substance to be washed away much more easily.\n\nSorry for the long explanation, but I think that covers all the basics.

"Could be a number of contributing factors: \n\n1. Taste preferences - you just like fattier and sugary foods more, which is the norm for most people since we evolved to prefer those foods because they are more energy dense. We also tend to have a natural dislike of veggies because of their bitter taste which our bodies usually equate with poison. There are some people out there who naturally prefer eating things like broccoli and brussel sprouts and that could be due to a combination of genetic predisposition and environment (ie they were raised on a largely plant based diet from birth so that's what they're used to).\n2. Habit- This informs taste preferences, but the diet you mainly eat and the diet you were raised on will in part influence the diet you prefer and will eat in the future. \n3. Nutritional profiles- In a lot of fast food and other processed junk foods there are certain chemicals added that give it an addictive quality. MSG for example enhances the taste of other foods you eat with it, which tends to make you feel less satiated and eat more. Carbohydrates/sugar is the most culpable macronutrient and the one we most tend to crave because it is metabolized (broken down to smaller chemical components) more quickly compared to fat and protein. \n4. Brain chemistry - There is a lot to be said about the interplay between the gastrointestinal tract and the brain. Basically, your brain will produce a greater pleasure response when you eat high sugar and fat foods probably to reinforce its importance since such food was scarce to our primitive ancestors. Those who ate more fat and sugar developed better fat stores and could survive famines better enhancing their fitness prospects overall. \n\nThere's a lot more to it, but at least that covers something.

"There are a lot of factors to this, but here are the two I know about, and they're related:\n\nStrong flavors turn off your appetite faster. Processed foods such as fast food tend to have pleasant but mild flavors that do not satiate an appetite quickly.\n\nThe other part is sugar, salt, fat, and MSG; the quadrumvirate of fast food. Each can be used to meld flavors and give a generally positive taste, while not actually tasting of anything specific. Used in conjunction, they make processed foods fairly irresistible."

"I have never tried answering one of these before but considering it seems there is still much debate here on it I'll give it a shot. Healthy foods are very high in nutrition. The human body really only needs around 2000 calories a day but if you do not get the nutrition needed from those 2000 calories the body will gladly take in 4000-6000 calories. Some nutritionists believe the declining nutritional quality of our foods to be a very strong factor in why we are eating so much and getting so large. So when you eat fast food that is low in nutritional value it is much easier to \"pig out\" as your body isn't getting the nutrition it needs from a smaller portion. Pair in the fact that most junk/fast food is loaded with salt to help preserve the food and mask flavors and the human body being highly addicted to salt, which stimulates the brain in a similar way as cigarettes, and it makes sense why you can eat much larger quantities."

In turn, we end have to drop them off ourselves (more cost).\n* Poor tracking system leading to more customer inquiries.\n* Near non-existent business (or customer) support.\n* Service refunds are difficult to track.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's the laborious and costly process of getting that package to the PO Box that makes it prohibitive."

"Most backstops do two things: they absorb the energy of the bullet by being much more dense than the bullet itself, and redirecting the bullet into something else, which will slow the bullet to a stop.\n\nMost backstops, especially in indoor ranges, are thick pieces of steel which are placed at an angle. The thick steel can absorb much of the energy of the bullet without the bullet penetrating the steel, and the angle will push the fragments into a trough, or a pool, or something else which absorbs any remaining energy.\n\nMany indoor ranges have caliber restrictions for the very reason you asked this question. The same piece of steel that stops a .45ACP round reliably may be damaged or useless against a larger or faster round. Ranges without caliber restrictions have backstops designed to absorb the highest calibers available."

"While many of the top-level replies are mentioning that speeding doesn't result in changing the total travel time by much, there is also the fact that Google knows how fast many of the other drivers are driving in that section of road at the moment and applies that data as a weight. If there's enough traffic along a given route, Google may even try to route you around it.\n\nThe cool thing, however, is where this data comes from. Most freeways have sensors and cameras in them which can provide local agencies with traffic data. Google subscribes to this. Another source, though, is android devices with internet and gps.\n\nIf a user has the appropriate check boxes clicked (and they are checked by default), the phone or tablet will send anonymous gps data which includes location, direction of travel, and speed. Google aggregates this data and notices a large number of phone hurtling down a particular road at an average speed of 63mph, it's safe to assume that this particular thoroughfare has a speed limit of 63mph. When, on a particular day, the majority of phone are only traveling 5mph, the route gets marked red on the Google maps app on the phone, the road's weight is adjusted, and people using Google maps (or Google navigate on devices) may be routed around the area.\n\nSo really, it's a little of column a and of column b; Google knows that how fast you go won't affect the travel time by much, if know how fast you'll likely go through each segment of road, it knows about traffic and alternates. Google knows."

"Answer to this is, it depends on what you are removing, the image around what is being removed, and the scale vs the size of the image. \n\nRemoving smaller things is often done by copying/extending some of background. Removing large portion of a photo may require finding a similar photo, and coping off parts. Though this can be tricky, due to lighting changes, pixel density, etc. \n\nRemoving large objects from a photo or extending a photo can be done, if there is a fairly regular background. Simply copy the background in, adding just enough changes to it to prevent the brain from seeing it as duplicate. \n\nIn a professional/planned setting. Often two or three photos are taken. Each representing some portion of the photo, and the final is created by compositing them together. Say for instance, you are a wedding photographer, you get the perfect photo of the bride in front of a fountain, but there is a pigeon playing in the water. Using the first technique would be challenging, but a smart photographer will simply wait until the pigeon leaves, and with the bride out of frame, take the same photo. Now replacing that section becomes simple.\n"
"I don't know if this has been mentioned but the reason why so many frequencies can be packed onto the wire is because the frequencies travel in layers.

That's one reason higher frequencies tend to be much more sensitive and have transmission problems. "

"When a car approaches, it sounds of a higher pitch. When it goes away, it sounds lower. That's because waves pile up, since the car goes at a decent fraction of the speed of sound. This is the Doppler effect.\n\nIf a green object approaches at a decent fraction of the speed of light, it will look bluer (blue shift). However, if it goes away at a fraction of the speed of light, it will look redder (red shift).\n\nMost of the galaxies we can see are shifted to red, which means they are going far from us. Not only that, but further galaxies are getting away from us *faster*.\n\nSince according to relativity all frames of reference are as valid, then from those remote galaxies we would observe their nearest going away slower, and the milky way going away faster.\n\nThat means space itself is *expanding*. More precise measurements point out that it's not only expanding, but also *accelerating its expansion*.\n\nImagine our 3D space as the 2D surface of a balloon. As we inflate the balloon, objects that are further away will separate even faster.\n\nI'm sure I was right until now.

Getting low income children in to see doctors early is a massive benefit that leads to less emergency room visits, which are the single greatest drain on a health care system.  when uninsured people walk out on their bill because they cannot pay, the hospital passes the bill onto the insured customers that can pay.

"&gt; Right. If you go 5 over the speed limit, you only save 5 miles per hour - meaning you would have to drive 6 hours at 65mph to make up about a half hour. For only an hour drive at 65mph, you maybe saved about four minutes, if that.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Since most of your trips are probably 30 minutes or less, even if you speed at 10 over, and don't ever have to stop for red lights (which end up negating any gains you made), you only gain about 0-1 minutes. The risk is almost never worth the benefit - even for ambulances or fire trucks, which no longer streak down the roadways anymore.\n\n"

"&gt; Except when the high and low tone are very close to each other that isn't quite true\n\nYou are right. The beats you hear are interference, but they are still the result of superposition. The two tones can still be separated with a sufficiently exact band pass filter, but each tone would continue to suffer from the interference.\n\nI assume this is why radio frequencies have to be sufficiently far from each other, so that their signals can be superimposed with minimal interference. \n\nIn fact, [two sources emitting the exact same tone can interfere with each other] (http://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/sound/u11l3a.cfm). This is the same concept that causes the acoustic beats."

That's how we learn the meaning of words behind things that aren't tangible, i.e. ideas, feelings etc."

"First, each channel have a different frequency, those frequency being different don't interfere with each others. Same as with a radio. Each channels are 6MHz wide for NTSC. Plain analog cable use the channel dumbly... Enter the cable box, modem cable, phone and whatever else go on the cable. All of them get in the same category: a modem... Want TV? it really is data... same with the phone and of course the internet. Since it's data, they can actually do better frequency managements.\nFirst, the TV stream is compressed, so it take less data. Taking less data mean less information to transmit. Which open the door to frequency sharing. Let's say that the signal take 1/4 of the space, the equipment can now sync with your neighbours, and 4 different stream can use the same frequency, since it will send 1 packet to you. You are then \"done\" for a little while, meanwhile the frequency is free to be used by your neighbour, so the provider send another packet to the neighbour... and so on, until you now need the frequency for the next packet.\nThe user don't know about it, as it's fully transparent.\nSo let's say that there is 200 channels, instantly this make it like 800.\nNow they can even use the frequency more efficiently, by compressing more the TV data... This allow for more \"slot\" per frequency.\nNow, if you want to transmit data (internet, phone), then it simply split those frequency even more, into tiny time slots, which allow lots of devices to cooperate and share the frequency. Need more speed? more slots are allocated to you. Need even more speed? Multiple frequency is assigned. The magic of this is: as soon as you're done transfering the data, those frequency/slots are freed to be used by the neighbours.\n\ntl;dr: with cable box, you really have video on demand, which is kinda like internet tv so is data..."
"Think of the cable like a long strip of paper, that constantly feeds from your cable provider to your TV.\n\nYou can write words on this paper in black ink, but you can also write words in red ink, orange ink, blue ink, etc.\n\nIf you wanted, you could write different sentences all on top of one another using different color inks for each, and then pick one sentence to read at the other end by picking out a specific color.\n\nThis is basically what happens with coaxial cable, except there are thousands of different colors in use at the same time, and the TV or modem is very good at zeroing in on exactly the right color that matches the channel you want to watch. \n\nInstead of sentences made up of words, these sentences are made of code that your TV can translate into a picture, or your modem can translate into Internet data."

Now you can focus on that person and avoid paying attention to anyone else.\nPicture in a picture works when you realize the people next to you are having a better conversation than the one you are having :P\n\nAnother analogy is a speaker system. How is it that a speaker with a tweeter and a bass can reproduce all the sounds of an orchestra?

"At the most basic level, every piece of hardware that sits between your finger and the internet is designed to transmit a certain amount of information at a certain speed.\n\nIf your internet connection is slower than your neighbor, it's because one of these pieces of hardware is either 1) not designed to transmit information as quickly or 2) damaged, an unable to transmit information quickly.\n\nThis problem can happen on your computer, on your home router or modem, on the side of the house where the cable/phone/fiber comes in, out at the street where many houses tie together, at the ISP, or at the server you're trying to get information from."

"Well, I have no idea if you're right, but that makes absolutely no sense to me. Since a person without any other contributing illness or injury does not experience a lingering pain, and endorphins don't last *that* long, the pain would have to be incredibly short in duration, which therefore makes it extremely unlikely for it to be \"incredible\" pain that leaves no lingering trace.\n\nUnless I'm missing or misunderanding some fundamental biological process, here, I don't see how it's possible for there to be a pain strong enough to cause an effectively sexual reaction to compensate for it (which still leaves off the issue of selective pressure, since sneezing really is involuntary unless you're so sentient and intelligent you can head one off by complex manual means), but short enough that the single release is enough, and *also* minor enough that it doesn't actually do any damage."
"**You're not accounting for traffic lights.**\n\nIn city driving, getting stuck at a single light can add several minutes to your trip.

"i know how wave superposition works in general, and that if you phase a wave by 180° and superimpose it on itself it cancels out. and so that some active noise canceling headphones use that.\n\nbut now i'm thinking what happens if you do the same with a room?  \nlike if you put in a room a microphone able to pick up every sound, and play that signal phased by 180° out of speakers in the same room (?)"
"Overly simplified visual:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/9fxLirP.jpg\n\nAdd the waves in A and B, and you get C (which I didn't match phase on - that wasn't intentional)\n\nNow, if you take the wave at C and subtract every value in B, you get wave A. The same thing works if the two waves have the same amplitude but different frequency. It quickly gets more complicated when you start to talk about frequency modulation, binary encoding, etc, but the general concept stands. \n\nThere's a whole area of mathematics called [Fourier Analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_analysis) that is about mixing and unmixing these types of signals.

"There are four primary factors in how a person will enjoy a roller-coaster:\n\n1. Fear - fear of heights, fear of falling, fear of getting stuck, the fear of not being in control, etc.\n2. Thrill - the thrill of speed and motion.\n3. Sickness - does the person get physically sick from the ride.\n4. Comfort - can the person fit in the ride.\n\nThe last item of comfort is the most straight forward in that a really tall person or a really fat person may not physically enjoy being squeezed into the ride.\n\nIf a person has so much fear they will develop anxiety which is simple not fun. The reasons for the fears vary, but it mostly revolves around their safety. It may not be rational, but many fears just aren't. Case in point, many of us know people who shriek and run out of the room at spiders or a mouse despite them being fairly harmless.\n\nThe thrill is from over-coming the natural fear in your body of falling or moving fast at objects that look they are going to hit you. Your body releases adrenaline which gives you a type of high.\n\nThe last one is simply that they make you sick. You may love the thrill, but you don't want to feel awful the rest of the day.\n\nI personally I love the thrill, but as I get older, I'm finding myself get sick from riding them after a few hours.

I never cared much about bees or wasps until I was stung by one.  My parents taught me to swat at flies so they don't land on food.  Prior to then, I didn't really care where the flies were.\n\nThere may be some instinctual aversion to some types of insects or spiders due to their shapes and coloration.

"Did a Ctrl-F for \"Shannon\" but thought it could use a little more explanation.  There are basically two factors that contribute to the number of bits per second you can get through the channel under this theorem.  First is bandwidth, which is covered well in this thread, second is Signal to Noise Ratio which I want to go into more.\n\nBasically, you can come up with a communication system where instead of just sending one bit at any instant, you're actually sending a \"symbol\" composed of a series of bits.  Maybe if you receive 1 volt, that's 0 0 1, if you receive 2 volts, that's 0 1 0, if you receive 3 volts, that's 0 1 1.  So if you had a receiver-transmitter system that could reliably distinguish between these 8 different levels, it would have 4 times the bits per second of a system with just two symbols (0/1).  The more noise you have, the harder it is to distinguish and you can't cram as many different symbol levels into your system.\n\nAnyways, that should explain the remaining part of this formula from the Shannon Hartley theorem:\n\n    C = B *log2(1+S/N)"

"I'm glad that someone raised calorie density, it is a really elegant concept which helps to explain what's going on here nicely. But let me explain in context with a few other things, including a brief touch on satiety mechanisms, weight loss and the 'pleasure trap' (a term from an amazing psychologist called Doug Lisle). It gets a bit technical (sorry). \n\nCalorie density: If you eat a less dense food you can eat only so much of it. If, for example, you wanted to get your calories for the day from only eating lettuce, you'd have to eat about 17.8kg of lettuce (calculated from the nutritional information on iceberg lettuce on the USDA website, and an average estimated energy intake for an adult male of about 10,000kJ). To explain why, I'll just give you an intro into nutrition (very quickly). All food is made up of macro ('big') and micro ('small') nutrients. Macronutrients make up all foods, they are carbohydrates, protein, or fat (alcohol is the fourth category on this list... of three...). Micronutrients are vitamins and minerals, found in very small amounts in these food. If you wanted to get your calories purely from one of the macronutrients (using fairly standard numbers of about 16kJ per gram for protein and carbohydrate, and 37kJ per gram), then you'd have to eat 10,000kJ (daily intake) / 37kJ per gram = 280g of pure fat (be it extra virgin olive oil or pure lard). If it were pure protein or carbohydrates (pure form of carbohydrates without water or fibre = pure sugar, and 'pure' protein doesn't exist except when equally and strangely processed into weird powders or whatnots), then the total energy intake for one day is 10,000kJ / 17 kJ per gram = 590g. Iceberg lettuce has an energy density far less than pure sugar though, because it contains lots of fibre (which is not really digestible by humans, but provides a small amount of sugar, about 5kJ per gram), and lots of water. Both of these things act together to bring the energy density down. Barbara Rolls is a researcher who is a pioneer in energy density, she sums it up as being all about water, fibre and fat. A Big Mac has a combination of fat, protein and carbohydrates, a bit of water in the bun, a bit of water and fibre in the vegetables, and these things acting together means that actually the calorie density is less than that of pure sugar. I've attached some screenshots of graphs I made at the end. \n\nCalorie density, once you have that under your belt, helps explain satiety (the process of becoming full). As Barbara Rolls has demonstrated with her research people tend to eat a certain weight of food. By adjusting your total energy density by introducing foods with water or fibre (i.e. vegetables), or foods with more water in them (like soups), then you have more 'bulk'. Bulk stimulates stretch of the stomach and causes stretch receptors to fire off saying 'oi, I've eaten something'. The stomach and intestines also sense the makeup of the food and will cause a 'neuroendocrine' response, which means basically your body figures what you have put in. A few points here before I progress, water alone passes through the stomach too quickly to cause these responses, and doesn't fill people up - but in soups you will find the water is adding bulk. This is why eating soups is great for weight loss. When you look at a food like a potato, it is actually great from a satiety point of view, it is not much fat, adequate protein, and high levels of carbohydrates (which from a purely weight loss point of view are not the devils they are made out to be, given there are few calories per gram). Because potatoes come with water and fibre, they add bulk, causing stretch. But if I were to take a potato and cook it in oil (potato chips) suddenly I've added something with no fibre, cooked out the water, and added the densest possible thing there is (oil), so it becomes a disaster for weight control. I've doubled or tripled the calories, but it may actually weigh less now with the water fried out, has less stretch of the stomach and is not good for satiation at all! Barbara rolls did some great research which adjusts the calories of the food people are eating, and observing changes in weight. If you move the calorie density down enough, you can eat as much as you want and you will not put on weight (within reason, c'mon). I've put this in the graph at the end, colour coded. The Big Mac actually made it just into the green but I was too biased, so I changed it to a borderline orange for the second graph - because we all know Big Macs are bad. \n\nSo to top it all off, we have a poster who is reporting a very subjective experience, but one we have all had - overeating. The psychologist Doug Lisle has a great book on the psychology behind our food choices, called the 'Pleasure Trap'. It's not as evangelical as it sounds - it is in fact a very good read. He talks about how we have evolved in an environment of scarcity of salt, fat, and sugar, and now we seek these things actively. Our environment no longer matches what we have evolved to seek - there is an oversupply of cheap and tasty Calorie Rich And Processed food (C.R.A.P. - as the nutritionist Jeff Novick talks about). The problem lies in that eating the 'wrong foods' feels right, and eating the 'right' stuff feels wrong, as least as far as your taste buds are concerned. \n\nSo, in summary, to answer your question, to get adequate stretch of the stomach you need to put some weight of food in it. Fast food can have a lot more energy in it than iceberg lettuce, say. You may be feeling like you have eaten more of the fast food, but have probably eaten the same weight as the healthy food. The healthy food has more water and seems like less substance, so you might think it is less (but that is not what the research shows). You can overeat more easily of foods which don't fill you up (high density junk food, fats), but in the long run people tend to eat a certain weight of food. Changing the average density of food by adding more vegetables and water, and reducing the fat causes a net loss (= weight loss without hunger, as you as satisfying your satiety mechanisms). But there are factors which are working against you (your taste buds and the environment), and you need to keep in mind that these things are really complex, this is an intro of the 20% with the 80% yield. We are social creatures and take cues from the environment around us also. \n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/OqwoM - screenshots of energy density graphs I made\nCheck out: Barbara Rolls (she is prolific, but here is one of her studies) http://m.ajcn.nutrition.org/content/82/1/236S.full\nDoug Lisle - hilarious TED talk - http://youtu.be/jX2btaDOBK8\nJeff Novick - really interesting nutritionist - http://youtu.be/9gTLpTq1nQk\nDr McDougall - if you're interested in the weight side of things, he has lots of articles on his website www.drmcdougall.com"

"Just a guess, since I don't know enough about it really, but it probably has something to do with precision and the amount of time it takes.\n\nImagine making, say, a sixshooter revolver. you have the hammer, the barrel, the stock, and the magazine (roughly). While each piece can be machined by a person, they have to start from a block of material and whittle down to the shape they want. This can lead to small errors in the shape and other issues with alignment size and other problems that take more time to either remake or fix the problem.\n\nA 3D printer however follows a pattern, made in something like blender, modeled , which are usually made to fit the pieces perfectly together. Also because a computer is making the measurements, the possibility of parts not fitting is very small, along with that, many 3D printers work \"top down\" which means instead of making the shape out of a block of medium, it \"prints\" each layer moving from the top of the model to the bottom (like ink being printed into the bottom of the paper.) The time it takes to print each piece would also be reduced because it doesn't rely on a human to constantly work it.\n\nNow, I use a gun because of the parts being rather simple to imagine. But this applies to most other products like them.\n\nEDIT: thank you /u/PerturbedPlatypus for the info on printed guns."

"If you're implying that humans are born afraid of insects, then your premise is false from the start. In short, that doesn't exist. \n\nThere's a common misconception that animals, including humans, are born with innate fear of dangerous animals and insects. In general that misconception stems partly from widespread misunderstanding(s) of evolution and, especially, from a gross general neglect of learning processes across the lifespan. Examples of some common misunderstandings (and the total neglect of ontogenic factors) can be seen in some of the early answers in this very ELI5. \n\nLet's take rhesus monkeys as an example. In the wild, rhesus monkeys show a strong fear response (and escape/avoidance behavior) in the presence of snakes (even non-poisonous snakes). The question is whether they are born with that fear (phylogenetically conditioned as your question implies) or acquire that fear sometime after birth (ontogenetically conditioned). \n\nEmpirical studies have demonstrated reliably and fairly convincingly that rhesus monkeys have no innate fear of poisonous snakes (or snake-like objects). Young, lab-reared rhesus monkeys will unhesitatingly reach across a target snake (or snake-like stimulus) to reach food. The exceptions to that are revealing. If a young monkey has been raised by a parent with snake-fear AND the parent has shown a fear response in the presence of a snake-like stimulus, then the young monkey will show a similar fear response and will NOT reach across snake-like stimuli for food. That fear response is long lasting and resistant to extinction. Check out Mineka, Davidson, Cook, &amp; Keir (1984) for an early example.\n\nThe part that *is* phylogenetically conditioned is the organism's ability to generalize across stimuli. This generalization is a fundamental learning process that acts within an organism's lifespan, but that has been selected for by evolution. Generalization is what lets you recognize various shades of red as all belonging to \"red\" without needing to be taught every single shade separately. Generalization is what lets you recognize a tree species or dog breed that you've never seen before as a type of tree or dog, respectively. Generally, the more alike two stimuli are then the greater the generalization from the previously experienced stimulus to a novel stimulus. "

"How much do you know about wired networking? It's very much the same, except that instead of data being transmitted over a wire using electrical pulses (or light if it's fiber), data is transmitted over radio waves.\n\nIt is the same radio wave that makes your AM/FM radio work, but at different frequencies. Unlike your AM/FM radio, however, there's two-way communication happening. Your radio doesn't talk to the radio station, it only listens. Your Wifi hardware both listens and talks.\n\nAt it's most basic level (this is greatly simplified), your home wifi network is made up of two devices. The \"box\" you speak of is a wireless access point/router, which does two things: it says (in radio waves) \"hey, I'm here and I can provide you with a network connection\" and it also organizes the data it receives and passes it to the right place, like a switchboard.\n\nThe wireless hardware in your computer hears this message and responds with \"I'm here and I'd like to connect\". They exchange some information, including passwords and some other needed info, and then they're connected to each other.\n\nFrom there, it's just those two devices sending radio waves to each other."

"Besides recklessness and using economic theory dogmatically (really, most if not all theories will eventually result in complete disaster if you assume they are absolute truths and ignore the facts), hyperinflation. It's worth noting it was after a civil war.\n\nA typical ~~childish~~ *intuitive* solution to the problem of poverty is \"let's print more money\". And printing more money can actually be very useful!\n\nBut again, being reckless at that is a recipe for disaster. You print more notes, and split them between people. The prices will go up. If a Zimbabwean dollar was, say, 1/10 of a USD to begin with (actually a Z$ was worth more than a USD at the start),  printing as many notes as there were would make it worth 1/20 of a USD outside.\n\nThey got so used to printing that a Zimbabwean dollar was worth more as toilet paper than as money, so they ended up banning their own currency, and the State now uses USD, which is controlled by a saner entity (which isn't necessarily saying much)."

I realize you were exaggerating but the same holds true for all timed lights.

"This all depends on the vehicle's design. The main factor is friction; friction of the moving parts of the engine and drive train, friction of the tires against the road, and air friction against the shape of the vehicle. As you go faster and faster in a large box shaped vehicle, it becomes very inefficient to go too fast since you are spending all of your power just overcoming air resistance.  In a sleek sports car, much less power is needed to overcome air resistance and it is easier to maintain speed.\n\nIn my truck, I have a ladder rack and two ladders strapped on it. I get the best mileage doing 55 mph.  \n\nTest this while driving next time. Make sure you don't have any other cars nearby to be safe. Go 55 and let off the accelerator and see how long it takes to slow down by 10 mph without gas or brakes. Try again while going 80 and you will see that it goes down much faster."
"The two word answer is \"time dilation\".\n\nLight always travels at the same speed. That means if you're moving at half the speed of light, and I'm stationary, and your headlights are on, we'd both see the light from your headlights travelling at the speed of light.\n\nHow is this possible?\n\nThe answer is that, because of your speed, your time is slower than mine. If we both had identical clocks with us, your clock would go slower than mine, because your time is slower than mine. This is the basis of Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity.\n\nIn fact, when you do the maths, you find that this effect is barely noticeable unless you're travelling very, very close to the speed of light. But even so, it's significant enough that the GPS system needs to take it into account, as described [here](http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~pogge/Ast162/Unit5/gps.html)."
"It worth mentioning that not only did the fire bombing of Tokyo kill more people that both atomic bombs combined, but a whole list of other major cities including Toyama were also over 90% destroyed by fire bombing.  Admiral Lemay even joked that if U.S. lost the war, they would all be hanged as war criminals by the Japanese.\n\nWhen the decision was made to drop the A bombs, most of the significant targets in Japan had already been totally destroyed by fire and conventional bombing attacks.  The loss rate for U.S. aircraft was around %4 per sortie, so the Japanese continued to use downed American aircraft and captured pilots as propaganda that the war was still an even battle for both sides and the Japanese were making progress.  It wasn't until 1 airplane with just 1 bomb could wipe out an entire city, that the Japanese leadership finally decided to surrender.  \n\nConsidering that the Japanese army was training women and children to make bamboo spears and attack invading American soldiers on beaches, the use of A-bombs to force Japan to surrender probably spared more Japanese lives than an invasion would have.

"There is a lot of hype surrounding 3D printing.  Almost everything from before is possible to make using other methods.  It does allow us to do some geometries that other methods cannot do (like [pre-assembled gear assemblies](https://www.google.com/search?q=3d+printed+gears&amp;safe=active&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=4MV&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=oo7EUuL2OIezyAGKooDICw&amp;ved=0CAkQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=638)), but no one really knows how to exploit this yet, at least for anything beyond art.\n\nIt is truly a really cool technology, but there are a lot of things that are not practical to make with 3D printing.  3D printing is only good for very low-volume products (less than 100,000 units), and other methods like plastic injection molding is much better for high volume products (more than 500,000 units).  The real value of 3D printing is that it is cheap (at least more than other manufacturing processes), easy to use, and can make geometries impossible by other methods.  These three properties make it possible for it to become ubiquitous."

"Slugs are lead yes, but birds will not eat a quarter sized jagged piece of lead.  Just about every state requires that waterfowl hunters use steel shot, because ducks and geese will feed on them.  \n\nI use steel shot for every occasion because I don't want to get accustomed to the extra range that lead shot produces.   Also because of the obvious, no wanton waste.  It's infuriating to see people use lead shot near open bodies of water for trap shooting (Salt Lake) dead puddle ducks pock the shore line.  \n\nAlso in response to the OP.  The EPA doesn't give a shit about this issue, these types of things are handled at the state level.  They can enact any regulation they want, it's the state that does the dirty work of enforcing.  \n\nCalifornia has recently banned lead shot entirely for all uses.  They say it's to protect the Condor, which is bullshit, (flagship species). A lot of hunters in California see through the Condor defense and are all pissed off.   As an avid hunter I think it is an important issue, and lead shot should be banned....slugs are fine IMO because no one uses them extensively for target practice, and they produce a very large, jagged bullet that I seriously doubt would look appetizing to any animal.  \n\nThe problem with this stance is that lots of trap and upland shotguns have been designed to fire lead shot, and those companies would be out a butt load of money if all the sudden their product was useless.  This happened in the 80's when states started to ban lead shot for waterfowl.  Gun manufacturer's had to go back to the drawing board to produce an effective shotgun, and almost all of those manufacturer's failed for several years before they came up with a decent product.  Lot's of lost revenue, lots of wounded animals, lots of population spikes.\n\n The bigger danger to birds has always been pollution runoff.

"It is not that the economy got so bad that trillions of dollars were necessary. **It is that the amount of money injected into an economy \ntotaled trillions of dollars that it became so bad**\n\nEssentially an economy is a complex system of basic transactions. If people are able to conduct those transactions then economy goes on better or worse depending on other factors like corruption, high taxation, regulation, lack of skilled workforce etc. In Zimbabwe all those factors were very high and economy was in deep crisis but instead of trying to fix it the government (which caused the problem as usual) tried to \"paper over\" the problem that is print more money than would otherwise be natural for the economy and give the impression that everything is ok since everyone can complete transactions.  You see the fastest way to tell if an economy is ok or not is to look for monetary transactions, interest rates etc - if money dries out it means people **do not want to trade**. And people do not want to trade when they expect hardship ahead.\n\nSo the Mugabe government just kept papering over and over and over every time economy came to a halt and because of that nothing was changed - the economy is still in the same bad shape as it was only now it has hyperinflation too.\n\nThe very same thing is currently occuring in the US and in the global economy in general. Last year FED pumped some 80 to 100 billion dollars  per month into the economy. To that means that a **trillion** of new dollars has been created every year since the crisis began. This pushes the economy forward somewhat but does not force any structural changes since you need insolvency for that - people demanding their money and causing forcible change to the structure of economy. As long as people can get money they will wait... An economic pundit Marc Faber often jokes about *Zimbabwe school of economics* that is the preferred choice among top US economic figures."

"The speed of light remains the same as other have already pointed out - what's missing is that something *does* change though: The frequency!

"Your ears operate in a very narrow range of frequencies, yet you are still able to hear a trumpet, a violin, a bass, and two people singing all at the same time and be able to tell that you are hearing five different sounds.  You may even be able to tell if the singing voices are two women, two men, or a man and a woman, or that one of them is Ethel Merman.\n\nThis is possible because those sounds are all occurring at different frequencies. Your brain is able to isolate the different frequencies and perform pattern recognition on each sound independently.\n\nElectrical signals carried by a coax cable work similarly, except that the range of possible frequences is much greater.  Hundreds of distinct frequences can be used and isolated with relatively inexpensive equipment.  That equipment isolates everything that it's receiving in the \"trumpet\" range from everything in the \"violin\" range from everything in the \"bass\" range and splits them out to seperate channels.\n\nFinally, since the violinist is isolated from all the other instruments, all she needs to do is furiously play three different notes at different volumes each to match how brightly she wants the red, green, and blue scanning electron beams to make the phosphor on the cathode ray tube's color masks glow, annnnnd I've dated myself.\n\nEdit: Added Ethel Merman."

"First off you should have a decent understand of how far light travels in a year (light-year). I'd recommend looking at a scale model of the solar system. It take light from the sun 8 minutes to reach the earth. Now while still looking at the solar system go twice as far, that's how far it will travel it 16 minutes. Once you consider how far light can travel in a hour, week, month, you'll start to develop an understanding of a light year and just how big the cosmos is. What you need to take away from this is when light from the sun reaches your eyes, your seeing the sun as it was 8 minutes ago.\n\nNow actual astronomers use really powerful telescopes that can see a lot deeper into space than the human eye, and can even see in spectrums the naked eye can't. But you have to remember the farther away you look, the farther back in time you are seeing. Scientist have already released an image of of the early universe where the light was only 380,000 years old. \n\nAnother method is by measuring the rate at which the universe is expanding. Then people who are really good at math and also using computers we are able to kind of trace everything back time when everything was a lot closer together, until eventually in existence was smushed together, like a dense sea of everything.\n\n"

"Indeed, most cable providers now use for the television a digital scheme called QAM. This is also now used over the air, which is why a couple years ago everyone with older televisions had to buy a converter box (it interprets digital QAM signals and converts them to analogue signals for televisions not capable of interpreting QAM). As a somewhat confusing note, QAM is also a type of radio signalling, which stands for Quadrature Amplitude Modulation. QAM television uses QAM, but also implies standards for the video encoding.\n\nA QAM channel uses significantly less bandwidth (in terms of radio spectrum) than an analogue television channel. This opens a lot of extra space in the spectrum, which the FCC hopes to allocate to other technologies (specifically high-speed wireless internet). On the cable network, though, you get a lot more bandwidth to use since you don't have to restrict yourself to space available in the public spectrum. Cable providers can thus take advantage of QAM to pack more channels (particularly more HD channels) and faster internet service in to their network. I believe a QAM channel can carry about 30Mbps of data.\n\nYou mention that you also have internet and VoIP. VoIP is routed over the internet (thus the \"over Internet Protocol\"), so really we're just looking at one more protocol for both of these. This protocol is called DOCSIS, or the Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification. DOCSIS runs your data through television channels using QAM modulation, and because of encoding differences can actually do up to 40Mbps per channel, with many carriers bonding multiple channels to offer the 50 and 100 Mbps options you might see. \n\nA long-term trend in the data utility space is the \"IPification\" of everything. VoIP is now becoming a fairly ubiquitous offering, even though some companies still feel that customers mistrust VoIP (see, for example, Comcast Digital Phone which according to the advertising \"is not VoIP\" even though it uses VoIP technologies, just with an FXS adapter built in to your cable modem and all the management handled by Comcast). While dedicated cable TV services are alive and well, the number of subscribers who are dropping cable television in favor of Netflix, Hulu, etc can be seen as a trend towards IPTV that will eventually replace cable television. It is almost certain that in the future you will have only an IP connection to the home over which all other data services will be delivered, which will simplify infrastructure."

Again, still gonna lose my dollar, whether or not I own a piece of that corporation or it's stocks. I can't exist in society without supporting many corporations. They will get my dollar and pass it on to the government.

Humans in general have something called 'infantile amnesia.' That's a whole other thread for a whole other day (or never), but my point is that we learn many things early in life that we have no \"conscious memory\" of having learned. You almost certainly do not *really* **remember** learning to crawl or walk or speak your first words--but I doubt you would suggest that you were born with an innate knowledge of crawling, walking, or speaking.

"A Turing machine can have any number of possible 'states', and can be in one state at any given time. It has a tape which is a string of 'symbols', and a 'head' or 'pointer' which can move back and forth along the tape.\n \nThe machine looks at the symbol currently under the pointer, and the current state. Based on this it can move the pointer one step left or right, change to a different state, or overwrite with a different symbol at the pointers current position.\n \nThe initial string of symbols on the tape represents the input to the machine.  Output can be read from the same tape after the machine is finished working. \n \nThe machine is programmed by specifying all of the possible states, and the rules for what the machine should do when it sees particular combinations of state and symbols under the pointer.\n \nThe best way to get a real impression of how this works to create a real program is to find some simulations or videos online with simple examples."

"Rather it would be aspects of our intellect. Many other species have cognitive abilities that match, exceed or approximate our own. Thus it is not enough to say that our complete intellect is unique to us alone. Very briefly - but I can expand if you wish - the three main aspects of human that set us apart are:\n\n1. Aspects of language\n\n2. Aspects of culture: [Animals posses culture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_culture) in much the same way we do.  Human culture is only different one major way - we easily build upon previous experience. Known as the ratchet effect or cumulative culture we can take someone else's idea and change it slightly to build on it, the previous idea is never lost. Our knowledge is continuously building upon its self. Animals have a harder time accomplishing this, if a novel idea is presented it takes a long time for it to take hold and transmit through a population. Moreover, adult humans have an easier time learning new skills, whereas adults in other animals have a much harder time - key cultural transmission occurs when an individual is in the infant or juvenile stage.\n\n3. Aspects of cognition: Combined,  [Cooperative breeding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_breeding) and the motivation to share mental states with others leads to [shared intentionality](http://www.eva.mpg.de/psycho/pdf/Publications_2007_PDF/Shared_intentionality_07.pdf), which is the ability and desire to work collaboratively with others towards a shared goal, as well as understanding that others are aware of your intentions. Cooperative breeding in primates to date is observed only in callatrichids and humans, both of which exhibit shared intentionality. What sets apart humans from other cooperative breeders with shared intentionality is our ancestral ape-level cognitive system (e.g. ability to problem solve, use tools etc). The unique combination of social cognitive skills, ape-level cognitive skills and shared intentionality led to the development of our species-specific traits, including specific aspects of language and enhanced cultural transmission. Our ape-level cognitive skills stem from freed grasping hands and opposable thumbs, our tool use and ability to solve complex problems. In theory, extant apes have all the necessary cognitive preconditions (i.e. simple understanding of others mental states) approximating humans but they lack the motivational components of cooperative breeding, and thus lack shared intentionality. However, groups of chimpanzees hunting involve the delegation of tasks (i.e herders, ambushers) where all participants must assess the others hunting position and effectiveness in order to successfully carry out a shared goal. What is contested is whether they understand that together they are dedicated to the shared goal, a key component of shared intentionality.\n"

"Okay, so here is what I got from my brother, he's a personal trainer and Dietitian. He said that the reason we can eat more fast food than healthy food is essentially because healthy food is what is known as \"Whole Food\". Whole food has more nutrients, fibre, protein and a higher energy count than Fast Food. Thus it takes the body longer to break down and send whatever nutrients need to be sent through your body. \n\nFast food, is very low energy and highly degradable not to mention the additives that are put into some food that are appetite stimulants. Thus the body can break down the food a lot quicker and you get hungry faster afterwards. This is also the explanation behind the half hour Chinese food munchies."

It's just Greece wouldn't have access to a good supply of Euros, and they may be better off going back to the Drachma.\n\n&gt; Is the use of ones currency abroad even of interest?\n\nSome countries may not have a strong economy, and it may pay off to use a foreign currency of recognized value. To the country that makes the money, it may be useful to have more people depending on it.\n\n&gt; For instance, does use of Dollars all over the world benefit or damage U.S economy?\n\nMore like the opposite. The fact that oil is bought in USD gives much more stability to the dollar, since you can change dollars for oil. In fact, Iran and Venezuela made an agreement to stop using dollars, since they didn't want to help the US in any way."
"Consider the fact that your old school TV can pick up many channels off the air. Also your radio can pick up many radio stations (also off the air). Now imagine that you had many TV's and radios, all in the same room, all tuned to different channels. One would expect them all to tune in to their channel and receive their desired frequency! This happens as a result of \"tuning\" your receiver to select the channel from every available broadcast in the area. They are all on the air at once - you have to tell the receiver what to listen to.\n\nAll of these broadcasters coordinate their transmissions to keep from interfering. If they don't play nice the system breaks, and then nobody can get their message out. \n\nWhen you plug your cable box into a cable system, you're actually plugging it into whats known as a \"distributed antenna system\" or DAS. For the purposes of this conversation, you can say that the DAS is like a private copy of the over-the-air environment. It is a closed network, so the cable company can develop their own coordination and use it how they like.\n\nModern technologies allow them to use advanced data compression techniques to pack LOADS of data into this broadcasting environment. They are FAR more efficient then their common over-the-air signals (the old channels 5, 7, 13, etc...). \n\nTo answer the internet traffic part, well it turns out that there is a limit. Your entire neighborhood shares that data connection. Fortunately, in a well designed system, the pipe is just so large that each user can get what they want without affecting the others. Because the cable company has total control of their communications environment, they can add capacity with relative ease to respond to complaints. (Though they often don't want to pay for the equipment, and so don't)\n\nTL;DR: The single wire that you see is an antenna that represents a private duplicate of the entire radio spectrum. Cable companies control the spectrum and are able to use heavy compression technologies to get more bang for the buck than over-the-air broadcast. "

"A perfect mirror is white coloured, because it reflects all colours equally. (Actual mirrors may be light grey or slightly tinted.) White objects reflect all visible light, black objects absorb all visible light, and red objects, for example, absorb all colours except red. \n\nThe difference between a mirror and a normal \"white\" object is specular vs diffuse reflection. Specular (shiny) surfaces reflect all light rays at the exact angle they arrive, mirrored around the surface normal. So in a perfect mirror, you see all the reflected light rays in the same pattern as they arrive, so it looks like the original scene, from a different angle. \n\nDiffuse (matte) surfaces scatter light rays on reflection, generally in all directions equally. So the scene pattern is destroyed, and what you see instead is just a very blurred colour average of the incoming light. Again, this this reflection could be white (all colours reflected) or any shade (selective colours reflected).\n\nIn general, materials have a \"specularity\" value, that varies between perfect diffuse (0) to perfect specular (1). A specularity of 0.8, for example, corresponding to a \"rough shiny\" surface, would look kind of mirror-like, but blurred. \n\nMany materials consist of multiple layers: for example, an apple has a diffuse red underlayer, and a shiny specular coating, which is why you can see part of the incoming scene reflected weakly and blurred, on top of the apple's underlying red colour."

"We had to have a PO Box a few years ago.  I think, especially in smaller towns, that it depends on where the box is and whether it's a manned post office.

"Well, a 9mm slug (non hollow-point) is around 115 grain, or 16.429 pounds per 1,000 rounds.

Now start multiplying that by day, week, month and year. Add in other kinds of ammunition. Also include all the brass ($1.25-ish/lb).\n\nOver an entire year, it would be a not insignificant amount of money that is essentially free for the business, and when you're running a small business, every dollar counts.

We can extend that by adding in any other pattern that doesn't conflict with the existing ones, and we'll still be able to tell each piece apart over time. We have x^0 (constant) and x^1 (linear), so we can add x^2 (squared): 0, 1, 4, 9. Summing everything together, that gives us 0.5, 2.5, 6.5, 12.5. If we look hard enough, we can still tell apart the three individual parts we added together.\n\nWhen we do this with waves, we either use hardware or software filters to pick out the different frequencies we want.

"You have a center in your brain that is constantly inhibited by lots of neurotransmitters. When your brain starts to synchronize activity and at different parts of the day, there's different levels of neurotransmitters. \n*for those interested: GABA, Serotonin, Histamine, Noradrenaline, Acetyl Choline, Glutamate.*\nSome of other neurotransmitters are sleep inducing (eg adenosine, which caffeine counteracts you responding to, but you still build it up, hence a crash). \n\n**There's a brain area that is literally a switch. Once you reach the right levels of neurotransmitters (thus brain waves), this brain region is activated (rather no longer inhibited), knocking out consciousness.**\n\nEDIT: here's a good scientific explanation from my sister uni http://thebrain.mcgill.ca/flash/a/a_11/a_11_cl/a_11_cl_cyc/a_11_cl_cyc.html"

"Oh, you're talking about applying the concept of noise cancelling headphones to an entire room?\n\nIt's possible, but more technically difficult because you have to account for the origin of any sounds you want to cancel. You would have to create a source for the cancellation wave, such that it would produce the cancellation wave along the same geometry as the original sound. This would generally be done with an array of speakers.\n\nSuppose you have a room, and there is a source of noise against from one wall. A window maybe, allowing noise from the outside of the room to enter. Once the sound waves enter the window, they expand semi-spherically to fill the room. \n\nIf you put a microphone in the center of the window, you would be able to capture sound waves as they enter the room. If you configured an array of speakers that would emit sounds along the same geometry as any sounds entering through the window, you could replay an out-of-phase version of sounds captured in the microphone to create a noise cancellation effect.\n\nThe solution varies depending on the location and number of sound sources that you want to cancel out.\n\nI believe that this concept is applied in some amphitheaters, to cancel reflected sounds from walls and ceilings. In these cases, the location of the sound sources is well known and the proper geometries can be calculated."

"Not really.  However, we can look at this in two ways. \n \n* Is it possible to use state power to suppress certain words from the public discourse and would this prevent the underlying ideas from being debated? \n* Assuming we had a mechanism to universally enforce such limits, would this actually limit certain thoughts.\n\nFor the first, we have a good experiment in China where the state routinely bans words or phrases to limit the public discourse.  You can see this on the Chinese version of twitter Weibo.  Wikipedia actually has a pretty thorough page both on Government [censorship](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship_in_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China) and the various ways the Chinese people get around [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship_in_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China).  However, this is mostly the technically ways, but it shows how even on a system that is technically (in theory at least) censorable, people find a way to circumvent the controls.  Imagine how difficult it would be to do this on the scale of an entire linguistic community!\n\nMore interesting is how the Chinese internet users substitute words that sound like or rhyme with the words they want to say developing a sort of [theives cant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thieves_cant) that sounds like people are discussing one thing to outsiders when they are in reality talking about banned ideas.  See [this](http://cosn.acm.org/2013/files/Session4/Session4Paper2.pdf) presentations for more.  This shows how difficult it is to suppress discussion of banned ideas.  People find a way.\n\nMoreover, our mind is capable of thinking up things for which we have no words.  At a deep level, our thinking is non-linguistic only rising to level of words in a our conscious mind.  Think of all the times you were wrestling with a problem and couldn't find a solution only to ignore it for a while and suddenly have the solution pop up in your mind. (see [this article](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/ulterior-motives/201210/can-you-be-unconsciously-creative) for more insight).  Your unconscious isn't bound to the concepts you have words for and can generate novel solutions to which you later need to find the words for.  This can lead to new words being coined or old words re-interpreted.\n\nEDIT: fixed formatting"

"All indoor firing ranges have some sort of 'collector' for lead, which simply consist of a steel wall that stops the projectiles. It varies alot when it comes to outdoor ranges. On my local outdoor shooting range (50 m), we are only allowed to shoot .22 lr. as it is the discipline in which we compete. Because of the low calibre, we can set up lead collectors without them being shot to pieces. We have simply dug large plastic pipes down behind every target on the range and filled them with sand. Once a year we dig out the sand, put the sand through sieves, collect the lead, fill the pipes with sand again and sell the lead. This system has saved us alot of time and effort, as we used to dig out all the dirt behind the range and look for lead by hand.\n\nIn my country, Denmark, we have very strict envirromental laws that prohibits lead in the nature as it contaminates the ground water. On our 'fixed' firing ranges, we always collect the lead, as the lead is a great income as scrap metal, but also because the authorities would terminate our license to use the range otherwise. These rules have been here for longer than I can remember and I respect them, but I am always amazed when I visit the large firing ranges. There are a few large areas in Denmark which have formerly been used as military training ground, but which have been giving/sold to locals to use for shooting competetions and for the hunters to train on. There are usually a few fixed ranges in these terrains, but the majority of the ranges used are random, temporary ranges set up for the occasion. These terrains are NEVER cleared of lead and I find it strange that our government are setting strict rules for fixed ranges, but lack enforcement when it comes to former state-owned firing ranges."

"Think of your sound system. Let's say you have a 2.1 system, with 2 speakers and one subwoofer. However, you have two channels of stereo audio coming in that carry the full range audio signal (highs and lows). The amplifier has a device called a crossover, and it splits the signal into two signals - one with just the low frequency content (for the subwoofer) and one with the high frequency content (for the speakers). The end result is that none of the bass goes to the speakers, and none of the midrange and treble goes to the subwoofer.\n\nIn this example, the two resulting signals are related to each other. But now let's pretend that the low frequencies contain the information for channel 1, and the middle and high frequencies contain the information for channel 2. Together, the signal would not be useful. But if you applied a device like the crossover described above to that signal, you would wind up with two separate, usable signals for the two channels. It would then be up to you to choose which channel to listen to, and to ignore the other channel."

"Back to the original question of the article of how do so many different types of media go through the wires, wouldn't the amount of different waves appear as a logarithmic function? If I remember correctly from what physics I have had, if you have waves that are equal in wavelength, they will contstructively interfere with each other disturbing the transmission of media. Similarly, if the waves are half a wavelength off they will destructively interfere with each other. So, the amount of wavelengths available decreases in a logarithmic pattern. If this is correct, how can these wires sustain so many different types of media?"
"I look at it this way, there's  a man driving 80 MPH and a man driving 60 MPH. Both heading for a destination 80 miles away. The man driving 80 MPH will arrive exactly in an hour while the man driving 60 will be at the destination 20 minutes after the man who was driving 80. Really you're not saving that much time given the distance traveled. "
"Check out the [Shannon-Harley Theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon%E2%80%93Hartley_theorem)\n\nIt basically says the effective bitrate is proportional to the bandwidth of the medium and the signal to noise ratio.  The higher the bandwidth, the more data can be sent.  The more noise, the lower the data.\n\nC = B log2 ( 1 + S/N )\n\nC=bit rate\n\nB=bandwidth\n\nS/N = signal to noise ratio\n\n"
"Yeah because when talking about temperature 30 degrees Fahrenheit sounds so much better than 0 degrees Celsius.\n\nNo it is just more like \"We don't want to conform to the rest of the world because we are better.\"\n\nAnd a new word I learn in this thread that seems to sum it up nicely: Ethnocentric.\n"
"Interesting."
"One more concept - people have been talking about bleed over between frequencies. Ever turn your car radio up or down one notch from the frequency of a powerful station, and notice that you still can hear a bit of the other station?\n\nWhat happens here is no filter is perfect. Let's say you want to listen to channel 1 (the bass in my example). So, you would use a filter to remove the high frequencies (channel 2). However, it is not possible for that filter to be perfect, and some data from channel 2 will be present in the output of the filter selecting channel 1. It will just be extremely attenuated, to the point where it would be very difficult to hear. \n\nUsing the stereo example, this ones easy to replicate too. Just unplug your speakers, and listen to just the subwoofer. If you listen closely, you'll hear some of the voices of the singer, even those you're listening to \"channel 1\" and those voices are in \"channel 2\". They will just be very quiet with respect to what's in channel 1 because the filter is doing its job and severely attenuating the data from channel 2."

"Each bill has a unique serial number on it and if someone was making their own it would be pretty obvious when the bills reached a bank or other place that checks the numbers.

"You are incorrect on most counts.  Most asset forfeitures are civil and do not require guilt or even a crime to have occurred.  Additionally, through \"equitable sharing\", about 80% of the assets go to the local and state police departments and are used to increase or maintain salaries, purchase more equipment, etc., as well as some more direct ways of enriching officers individually.  There are even units within departments that are completely dedicated to and 100% funded by civil asset forfeitures.

"The theoretical limit depends on the rate at which your Internet connection technology (cable, DSL, wireless...) can receive signals. \nEach is an encoded \"word\" of data in the \"language\" of your particular connection. \n\nImagine listening to a very fast talking auctioneer, too fast and you can't hear the words with accuracy. Having to get things repeated slows things down, and people can only talk so fast.\n\nHowever, this fast talking auctioneer is outside. Far away. With a lousy speaker amplifying him. In a noisy place. And he talks slower the lower his fee is...  To hear more words, you can get closer, get headphones or a hearing aid, or reduce the noise around you. Or pay him more to talk faster.\n\nThere is also concepts where the analogy breaks down, like multiple channels such as for cable TV Internet (not TV channels, multiple frequencies for data). I suppose you could watch other online auctions while listening..."

"The serial numbers would be the same as one other bill out there. How would banks ever come across two of the same. And even if the found a duplicate, there would be no way to tell which was the counterfeit (if the genius actually duplicated the exact process) so there would be no way for him to be caught, unless they got a warrant and found his equipment?"

"Essentially you are asking why is no one making an exact 100% perfect reproduction of cash. The answer to this is fairly simple - it is almost impossible to do. \n\nBank notes have level 1, 2 and 3 security features on board. Level 1 is the obvious stuff - is it made of the right material, does it have a hologram, does it have the right markings, etc. Level 2 is more detailed - does it fold correctly, are the micro-lines accurate, are the serial numbers accurate, does it show under UV, is the seal present, etc. Level 3 is the most detailed - these can only be seen in a forensic environment under a microscope and with very specialist knowladge.\n\nFor a bank note to pass day to day circulation, it has to pass level 1 and 2. You can ignore level 3 if you are a small time counterfeiter as you just want the guy in the store to accept it, but if you are big time then it needs to pass all three levels as you will be making millions of the things so can expect them to turn up in random forensic tests every now and then. \n\nYou cant just print a note with level 1 and 2 security features on it, let alone level 3. You can try, but it will not even be close to 100% accurate. If you want that level of accuracy, you need access to commercial grade printers (which are tens of millions of dollars and are highly controlled) and you need access to the materials to make it feel and fold right, which are also highly controlled. The government don't just let anyone buy these materials, and the companies that make them will only sell to highly vetted organisations. For example, you cannot phone the company that makes the silver seal and ask to buy a few thousand of them. Therefore its impossible to buy the real deal, so you would have to use sub-standard printers and sub-standard materials, thus making it impossible to make a 100% accurate reproduction.\n\nIt is an ongoing battle of security feature vs counterfitter which will no doubt go on forever. The counter fitters start to be able to accurately reproduce the security features (eg, make their owl silver film) so the government bring out new notes with harder features. Thus the cycle continues forever. The basic logic is that by the time someone has figured out how to accurately reproduce a given security feature, the note will no longer be in circulation anyway. "

"[They do](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superdollar). It's not some guy in his basement, though. It takes a lot of equipment, labor, and financing to set up an operation capable of producing high-quality counterfeits. In other words, it takes something like the nation of North Korea.\n\nAnd it is still counterfeit. Counterfeit money is money printed by someone other than the designated legal authority, in this case the Federal Reserve."

"Not sure why you're getting downvoted. I suspect some readers have little to no experience with a multitude of traffic lights on a single trip. I find that a 20 minute trip can be lengthened by as much as 50% due mainly to being locked into the pattern of getting every single red light. Not only waiting for the light to change, but slowing down to stop, and then starting up again (especially when there is so much traffic, you get a double-red even though you are going straight). I've tried this experiment many times on a trip with over 20 traffic lights, and I find that just a slight increase over the speed limit can result in substantial time savings, repeatedly."
