That means saving diligently and living within your means."
"I have had 5 cars in the last 6 years. Some I sold, some were in accidents and written off. I usually buy ~15 year old Japanese cars (Honda, Toyota).\n\nI track all my costs and mileage. My records show I've put 97,000km (61k miles) on all these cars since 2008.\n\n**Gas and oil**: $9600. It's expensive where I live (~$5/gal).\n\n**Capital cost**: $3700. Purchase price minus insurance payouts and sales. This is the net cost of the cars.\n\n**Repairs**: $3400. A couple radiators, a couple mufflers, brakes, tires, some clutch parts, a few new batteries.\n\n**Insurance**: $7800 for the last 6 years. Includes registration fees.\n\n**Total**: $24,500.\n\nThat's about $0.25/km or $0.40/mile, and I'm driving old cheap beaters. Add in a $300/mo car payment and you can double that cost."

"I think about things like this all the time these days. I live in Austin and I make enough to pay expenses and save a bit more than most, but definitely not enough to get me owning property or investing anytime soon, or really for a proper retirement in 35 years.\n\nI went to Bentonville, AR (Wal-Mart Land) for about a month for work and saw some of the house/apartment prices out there. Ridiculously low. I thought to myself \"Could I do this?\" (that is, get a decent job in a podunk town just for the purpose of saving a ton of money) Still something I think about a lot.\n\nThe entertainment stuff (live music, festivals, cool bars) is stuff that is easy to say I'll live without. The one thing I have noticed about living in small-town/suburban America is that there are NO single women, which is pretty critical. But beyond that, I spend a lot of time thinking about how much I actually pay to live in a \"cool city\" or feel like I am (or can be) entertained all the time."
"I came up with an analogy that I told to a friend who was asking me to join Amway/Quixtar:  \n  \nThese \"personal business\" ventures seem much like a piece of exercise equipment that you see on a TV infomercial. It's true that there are probably a small percentage of people who purchase the equipment and from there decide to fully and completely dedicate themselves to getting results. They may find it to be way more work than advertised, but they manage to make it happen through a lot of dedication and desire to go above-and-beyond. Of course, these are the stories that are going to be sold to you.\n  \nFor the larger majority of people, they will do one of two things: They may try it for a while, see some results, but find that it is very challenging and not as quick and easy as they were led to believe. They'll shrug their shoulders and figure it was worth a shot.\n  \nThe last group will get caught up in the excitement, pull the trigger, try it for a couple of days, and never touch it again.  "
"A sample asset allocation for a 21-year old could look like the following:\n\n* 10% Western Asset Core Bond A (ER 0.85%)\n\n* 60% Legg Mason S&amp;P 500 Fund (ER 0.66%)\n\n* 30% Alliance Bern Intl Value Fund (ER 1.45%)\n\nSince you have a fairly poor selection of funds to choose from, I'd highly recommend opening an IRA and getting your international exposure there.  An international stock fund such as Vanguard's Total International Index has an expense ratio approximately 1/7th that of your only international stock fund. \n\nContrary to what certain uninformed users might think, making a conscious effort to reduce expenses is the second most important thing when investing for the long term (second only to selecting your asset allocation).  Here's [a nice interactive page](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/insights/investingtruths/investing-truth-about-cost) showing the effect of expenses on your investments over time.  The single best indicator of superior long-term performance is a low expense ratio.  It's unfortunate that there's so much misinformation floating around out there to the contrary."

"Something to bear in mind: at $55k, your AGI is [perilously close](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/retirement/03/011603.asp) to the deduction phase-out for traditional IRAs ($56k), beyond which not all of your contributions are fully deductible, [because you also have a 401(k)](http://goo.gl/SGBGt).  After $66k AGI, you may not take any deduction.  \n\nRoth IRA has no such phase-out, obviously, since contributions are fully taxed; just the (much higher) *contribution* phase-out and income limit (for 2013, $112k and $127k, respectively)."

"No, I'm saying that there are very few cars I wouldn't recommend to a young and enthusiastic driver, but a WRX is one of them. Not only for financial reasons, but from a car enthusiasts point of view they spoil you. If you want to get GOOD at driving, have refined driving skills, appreciate a cars handling limits and be able to play around with them, then the WRX is NOT the car to start with. It's handling limits are too high, and the handling behaviour to \"snappy\" at the limit, because by the time you approach that limit you are going very, very fast. You also can't fully exploit them on the road, because you're doing illegal speeds to do so, but paradoxically their surefootedness makes them dull on track until you've tuned and modified them, which guess what? is more money you DON'T HAVE.\n\nI'm not saying you should never have a WRX. I'm saying that you should wait. You should build both your financial position and your driving experience so that you are able to enjoy the car you've \"always wanted\" without fear of life, licence or financial ruin.\n\nI appreciate that you don't know me, but I have taken the time to offer my honest advice from a point of expereince: That point of experience is a mid 30's guy who's owned a lot of very fun cars, driven many more fun cars, has had significant advanced driving tuition including trackdays, skid pan training and time at the Nurburgring, and currently competes in tarmac rallies.\n\nBy all means ignore me and buy the car of your dreams. But my advice is, I feel sound. There is always time to buy a WRX down the line. It's the car you want right now, but it's not the car you need. If you wait, you will get more enjoyment from it and it will cause you less anquish. Because cars cause anguish."

"You are always under water if you wrap up an under water vehicle trade in. First trade in value lower than what you could get, the new car purchase will be under water inherantly because depreciation and taxes and fees vs immediate resale value, and no down payment to offset this difference assumed because would pay off difference on old car if could. \n\nThat being said, it could still be a better sutuation potentially that what are in now but still vastly unfavorable than alternatives."
"You can operate it.  I think a better question to ask is: will I make decent money for the kind of time and effort this will entail?\n\nI recommend searching for Amway distributors near you.  The one time I wanted some \"Dish Drops\" I must have had a dozen leads.  If you have, say, 100 boxes' worth of laundry detergent business in your area, and you have 200 boxes' worth of distributors happy to sell the detergent already, who are YOU going to sell to?\n\nAnd do you want to burn through your relationships for this?  How much value do you place on your friends and neighbors?  Others have posted about this: when you get more pressure to make sales, and you start bugging friends, family, and your neighbors, eventually things are going to change, and not in a good way.\n\nBut looking on the bright side, let's assume that you could sell these products in your local area.  People want to buy soap, laundry soap, dish soap, whatever.  Would you rather do research into making your own, and keep 100% of the profit, or would you rather sell theirs, which you admit has a bad rep, and keep a percentage?  How big is that percentage, anyway?\n\nThere are a lot of people who do well making things and selling them online.  Some have personal websites, and some do the easy thing of listing with Etsy or Amazon or eBay.  Then, your customers come to you.  If your friends like your stuff and want to buy it, they can do that, but you're not pestering them when they may not be in a buying mood.\n\nTip: there are people who need truly unscented soap and laundry detergent.  Not \"unscented\" scent, but actually no scent at all.  I supply my friends, but that might be a decent niche market."

Better maybe, but the dealership will likely eat this situation alive given the likelihood of being car buying savvy and credit worthy is pretty low.

"Vanguard accounts come in two types.  The unsuffixed type, which just says \"Roth IRA\", is used for holding Vanguard-branded mutual funds, and *only* Vanguard-branded mutual funds.  You can call it the Vanguard account.  \n\n[The other type is the \"brokerage account\"](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/whatweoffer/stocksbondscds/brokerage-services-account), and is used to hold any other types of securities (ETFs, individual stocks, outside funds, Treasuries, etc).\n\n[Here's a Bogleheads thread which explains them.](http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=91499)  I'm quoting the most useful reply from that thread below.\n\n&gt; Welcome to the Vanguard Halo. Unlike other brokerages, Vanguard started out as a mutual-fund-only company. Ages ago, you could only buy/sell/exchange/transact Vanguard mutual funds and no other investments from any other fund company and not stocks. It was Vanguard mutual funds and only Vanguard mutual funds.\n&gt; \n&gt; So Vanguard made a deal with a brokerage service company and then eventually started their own Vanguard Brokerage Service company called VBS. This was better than what was going on before, but they have not integrated the two different companies seamlessly yet. You cannot buy Vanguard mutual funds at VBS and you cannot buy stocks, ETFs, and non-Vanguard mutual funds at the Vanguard Mutual Fund company. That's just the way it is right now.\n&gt; \n&gt; So if you have Vanguard Mutual Funds and anything else, you will end up with at least two accounts: One at each of the two sibling companies at Vanguard. To their credit, they share a web site and do not make you login to two different web sites.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyways, this snafu seems to be unusual as other brokerages and mutual fund places figured out how to do this right. For example, Fidelity, Schwab, USAA, and WellsFargo have no problems doing this right. I expect that Vanguard will get it's act together before the end of the century, but I won't be around to see that happen.\n"

You can even get 'fun' cars like miatas (mx-5), mr2's or Saab turbos for pennies. \n\nThere's room to have fun and not break the bank, but for a first car, when you're in your very first job, with $400/mo leeway in your made up finances?

"Alright man, I'm just going to give you the same advice I gave to all my other juniors, and hopefully you won't make the same mistakes a lot of junior enlisted make.\n\n1. Don't get married for the money. Yes barracks life sucks, but it doesn't suck nearly as bad as giving away half your stuff and the whole heaping mountain of misery that comes with marrying someone for the wrong reasons. If you think you've found the one, then by all means go for it. BUT you're still young, and I've seen too many of my guys get married too young, and then divorced a few years or even months later.\n2. Keep your expenses to a minimum. Get a cell phone, buy a car at a rate you can afford (go to your bank and get a preapproved used auto loan, don't tell the dealer how much you're approved out to), get car insurance, that's it. That's all you need for life in the barracks.\n3. Save your money. Save your money. Save your money. A friend of mine got out after 6 years with almost $110,000 to go to school on plus the GI bill. Guy had a flip phone, rode a bike everywhere, ate exclusively from the chow hall, and sat in his room and played video games with his downtime. The guy led a very humble life while he was in, but he doesn't have to worry about money for the  rest of the time he's in school.\n4. Retirement. TSP isn't the greatest, but it sure beats not having any sort of retirement plan. I contribute 15% of my base pay, and don't let it all just sit in G fund. The Lifetime 2050 fund is doing wonders for me, with some divvying up into C and F funds as well. Contribute what you can.\n4. If you don't need it, then you don't need it. Remind yourself of that whenever you're thinking about buying something. That also doesn't mean living a Spartan lifestyle of motivation, motivation, and more motivation to get you through life in the Military. If you don't have shit to do in your room on your free time (and believe me, you'll eventually have a lot of it), then buy yourself an xbox and a TV ersumshit.\n5. Don't start smoking, just don't. I did, and I'm still fucking paying for it. Nicotine gum is fucking expensive.\n\nI don't mean to talk down to you, but these are the big things that I'd tell my guys when I was in. I'm sure you get it from your Drill Sergeants, instructors, and NCOs as well, but that's because this shit is important.\n\nAgain, really not trying to talk down to you man."

"I'm in Vanguard Target Retirement. My personal feeling is that it's a touch aggressive. I'm 32 so I'm in the 2045 fund, which is currently 90% stocks. It gets gradually more conservative until retirement when it's 47% stocks, and continues until retirement+5 years where when it's 30% stocks.   I'm fine with how aggressive it is now, but I will probably switch to a different target retirement fund eventually, so as to match my more conservative appetite for risk."

Since I almost always had a surplus of money, I would just pay some of my bills ahead of time while putting money into savings. Also saving for the following semester is important.  \n\nI always had $2,000 in savings as my emergency fund (in case I lost my job, etc.) this was enough to cover my bills for probably 6 months where I went to school.

I wish I had put all my money in the bank instead of paying for a lot of things in cash. I kept HORRIBLE track of my spending because it was so much easier to just hand over cash. Put your money in the back ASAP and use something like Mint.com to track your spending. You'll thank yourself later when you're trying to account for where your money was going!  \n"

"The rental property is not some thing we can feasibly move back into. Getting rid of it has been an unmentionable between us, I think that's more out of ignorance. What does a short sale mean for this? The market has ticked up a bit over the past but not quite. The rent could match in 5-6 years. I will look at the interest rates and we have looked at budget and behaviors associated. This usually ends in unfulfilled promises and plans.

"It is true that owning is a very strong wealth building tool and that renting your whole life will cost you more in the end. Owning comes with its owns obstacles too though, but in the end you should come out well ahead of renting. \n\nMortgages are the least bad form of debt. They are the 'best' but I hate to use that word for any type of debt. A modest mortgage (15 year fixed rate that is no more than 1/4 of your take home pay) is very healthy. Even with that you can pay it off early. \n\nThe other option is to simply save up the cash while you rent modestly and then pay cash. This will save you a small fortune in interest (almost a whole house's worth with a 15 year, more than a whole house's worth on a 30 year), allow you to avoid debt, and still allow you to enjoy the benefits of home ownership."
"Just to update you, my Blue came today with a chip and a letter enclosed telling me that it has a chip and it will help me use it over seas and outside of the United States.\n\nUnless for some strange reason BCE is different in their system for chips than the standard Blue, but as others in here have reported they called a few times, people said no go away, then called back and folks said sure and shipped the cards out right away.\n\n"

"The asset allocation method of shifting your investments to more conservative things like bonds is a bit old fashioned and overlooks the fact that even in retirement you will need an income. You may build up wealth and then move everything to conservative investments only to then use up in your retirement what you built. Since people are living longer and those years are costing them more this is setting yourself up to undo what you worked so hard for your entire life. By staying in the same investments that you built over the course of your life your nest egg will continue to grow, not shrink. This means that whether you live to be 65 or 105 you will be fine. To top if all off you would actually leave something behind for your family when you finally do pass. "

"Since houses generally appreciate in value (YMMV), I would say there is nothing wrong with having a mortgage.  Even if a house were to gradually depreciate, a mortgage is still not bad debt.

(Provided: you have job stability, you think you'll want to live in that house for 5-10 years, you have a hefty down payment and you have enough cash reserves to afford maintenance and emergencies.)\n\nI've been renting my current house for 10+ years.  I have given my landlord over $200,000 during that time!  Every time I think about that it makes me feel a little queasy.  "

"Short selling it would be selling it for less than you owe on it.  But you have to get the bank to agree to this, and usually they won't agree unless you have stopped paying the mortgage already.

"Okay, that helps some.  The question is whether you'd be better off in the long-term just selling the condo (even at a loss) or continuing to pay off the mortgage and build equity in the property.  I think I'd need to know a bit more (how many years into how long of a mortgage, the mortgage rate, and how much is the property worth) to be 100% certain, but it seems ~~likely~~ possible that you should try to sell the property if you can because of the sheer amount of your debt.  An extra $300 a month will go a long way towards paying off your credit card debt.\n\nThat being said, the #1 thing that will help you is a second income, one that you could dump 100% into debt.  I'm assuming you won't burn most of a nurse's salary just paying for daycare or that you can find a way to only need daycare a few days a week.\n\nThe other thing you need to do is cut your expenses as much as possible. Some thoughts:\n\n- I would consider selling the $12k car and buying a $5k car so you can save on insurance and get rid of that loan.  Do you need two cars at all, actually?\n- The usual stuff: cancel cable, figure out how to go cheaper on phone and internet, stop eating out.\n- Create and stick to a budget.

I think most people would be surprised that it was a much larger difference so I pointed it out.\n\nThat extra money isn't just disappearing.  My projections including other investments (stocks and lending club so far) are much much higher.  I am going to be investing the extra amount and some in taxed accounts, and most likely maxing out my 401k in the next 5 years.  So the actual difference would be probably a couple 100k but I wanted to see worst vs. best with my current salary and contributions.\n\nIn the near future, I want to get a good amount of taxed money saved up for expanding my brokerage account and other investments and see what I can do with it.

"I retired early years ago, so I'm actually doing this. As a retiree you probably wouldn't stop investing in stocks. You simply reduce your exposure while simultaneously increasing your exposure to things like bond index funds, TIPS, I-Bonds, etc. That's the easy answer.\n\nBut there's really more to it than that. When you are retired it's important, IMO, to look forward and project (as best you can) where your living expenses will come from for the next five to ten years. IOW, it helps to have a plan in place that will help you to avoid selling assets at a loss and to help you visualize where the money to pay the bills will actually come from.\n\nSo I try to make a ten year projection, which is made much easier by having decades of actual living expenses categorized. So if you aren't doing that, I would highly recommend it. It becomes especially useful later to have a very solid grasp of your expenses, how they tend to fluctuate, what your off-chart expenses tend to be, etc. \n\nAs a retiree, I use a spreadsheet to 1) project expenses, estimate inflation, and so on, and 2) to determine how those expenses will be paid. IOW, from which account will the money come to cover expenses in 2014, 2015, 2016...? This helps me to visualize what will need to be sold when, and it might cause me to shift assets around a little so that I have enough cash for the short-term needs, enough short-term bonds or I-Bonds for intermediate term needs, and so on.\n\nI tend to err on the side of being too conservative, because when it comes right down to it, this is it for me. When I decided to pull the trigger and retire, I knew that, realistically, there would be no do-overs. So I choose to have nothing in stocks that I will need in the next 15 years. And that would be a minimum. But that's just me. Everyone has their own tolerance for risk. The point is, if you have accumulated enough and are conservative enough, stock market declines really aren't a big concern. But you're right. It's important to plan for this.\n\nAnd BTW, I think Buffet was responding to a question about investing in Berkshire. He replied by saying that most people are going to be better off in a broad based stock index fund. He wasn't speaking about asset allocation. He was speaking about investing in Berkshire vs. diversifying one's stock holdings in an index fund.\n\nI hope this helps."

"Great job with the investing, I think 10% is a reasonable amount. If you can do more, do more, and invest in blue chip stocks. I think that you should have at least one card though. Don't get me wrong, I am staunchly against debt, and resisted credit cards all throughout university, but I was offered one with 0% interest for over a year with fantastic benefits. Try to see if you can get a card like that, at least to build your credit. Buy a few items here and there and pay your balance in full every month.

"If they do a true-up, there's zero issue with maxing out early.  It's statistically better historically to put money into the market sooner rather than later. So, unless you have high interest debts or some other need for the money, I would go for maxing out earlier (and do it every year).\n\nWithout a true-up, you want to set your percentages so you max out right at or just before the end of the year.  It is a pain, especially if your income is bumpy with overtime, bonuses, etc.\n"

"A mortgage is widely regarded as \"acceptable\" debt. A house is not a luxury, a home is a basic need and you can either pay someone else to rent it temporarily, or you can borrow the capital, pay it back with interest, and in 25 or 30 years actually own bricks and mortar and a square of land.\n\nAs an example, I bought our house at 24, it was £232,000 and we borrowed £200,000 from the bank. 8 years later, We currently still owe £170,000 but the house is solidly valued at £290,000 (house next door with one less bedroom but otherwise identical sold for that last year).  And... .We don't even live in that house any more. It rents out and covers it's own mortgage, whilst we've emigrated and live overseas.\n\nYou can't \"win\" the other way around, because you have to live somewhere whilst you work and save. It would be ludicrous to pay a lifetimes rent to scrape together cash to buy a house outright - all the time chasing the housing markets, and trying to beat inflation as it erodes your savings.\n\n\n(Note I'm UK based, so the market here is a little simpler with far fewer ongoing taxes for homeowners and a much more long-term stable housing market)."

"&gt; Folks who invest in a house effectively tether themselves to a single spot. If you've got a family or if you're 100% certain your ass ins't moving for 10 years, then sure go ahead and get a house, otherwise rent.\n\nI don't think this is true, at all. We've rented out our home and moved overseas, with a 1 year old child in tow. No way are we \"tethered\" to our house, in fact it covers it's own mortgage fine in rental plus a bit for repairs etc. It enabled us to move overseas in safety, knowing we have a home to come back to if it all goes wrong.\n\nHad we NOT bought a house 10 years ago, I wouldn't have ridden the market that has seen our home increase from £230k to £290k in 8 years, or had that £120k equity in it by now. We would instead have paid rent, £10k+ a year to end up with nothing concrete.\n\nA house is an asset, and you can use it to open up opportunities. We have a house in the UK earning rent and paying off it's own mortgage, and we could now buy a home in Australia as well and live between the two, renting one whilst living in the other."

Sure, the stock market is at an all time high, and therefore feels like it needs a corrections, but also consider that from 1980 to 2000 the S&amp;P hit an all time record high during something like 18 out of those 20 years.

You don't need to rent your own place when you first land.  Be a roommate in someone else's place or rent a room.  Use Craigslist.  See if your new job can put you up temporarily when you first arrive.  You have options other than renting a house!  Holy cow, a house?\n\n3. If you must spent a ton of money on your own place, even if your score is low, get a copy of your credit report via [annualcreditreport.com](http://annualcreditreport.com) and print that thing out on some nice paper, maybe even in color and hand it over in person.

"I've been there with the car parts/upgrades thing. I had some very poweful/nice carts, and fell into the trap of \"must replace just in case\" and \"I need this/that upgrade\". Spent (wasted?) thousands.\n\nMore recently, I've tried \"Bangernomics\", that is buying old cheap but still fun (to me) cars and fixing them myself at rock bottom prices, rather than trying to keep them perfect. IT's been a great laugh, and I've leart a lot because there's no real risk involved in \"having a go\" at fixing a £750 car. How badly wrong can I get it? Plus, if something really catastrophic happens, I get £200 scrap for the car and buy something else cheap, and get to experience a different car.\n\nSo I'd recommend that.

"I have to say this was a good read. It helped me figure out a question I've been dealing with for some time...do I pay down my student debt ($14,800 @ 4.75%) or invest more in my 403b. Definitely invest in 403b while paying the minimum on the student debt. For one, the market should do better than 4.75% next year. Two, she says pay the minimum on anything below 8%, only sacrifice 401k if you're over 8% (personally, my number would be 7%). And three, better to invest in retirement early because of compounding returns. Also four, my loans will fall to 4.25% after 24 payments. So there's no reason to rush the payments at the expense of retirement investing."
"&gt; You need to be really careful not to price yourself out of your neighborhood with this addition. I would do every bit of research you can before you proceed.\n\nThis.  Location is by far the most important determiner of property value; lot size is next.  Home square footage is not anywhere near as important.  You'll read about price per square foot but that's a good way to compare homes in a given neighborhood because homes are often built similarly in a neighborhood.\n\nYour $300K addition to a $500K house is not going to change location or lot size.  You most likely will not end up with an $800K home; you'll have a 'white elephant' property that is at significant variance to the average home in your neighborhood and that may even pull the value down.\n\nIn fact, I just googled ['white elephant'](http://financial-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/white+elephant) to make sure I'd used the phrase correctly, and the definition in that link is 'a house that is overbuilt for its neighborhood.'"

(Somewhat ahead = Put a 5k down payment on the 2012 car, was able to get 4k back when I sold to CarMax) I then proceeded on with my quest to find a cheap, reliable, used car with the few thousand I came out ahead by selling to CarMax.

"While you're entering that, the worst case (and I'm going to blow your mind here) is to contribute 6% to your 401(k) to get the match.  Once you get the match, withdraw the entire amount.

You'd have to be paying very high taxes plus penalties on the withdrawl before it didn't make sense.\n\nEDIT: P.S. People seem to think I am suggesting this.  I am not suggesting this.  I'm just saying it is very hard to come up with a case where you would not want to take the money."

"A 230k to 290k increase in value is not typical in the USA. Historically speaking, housing usually paces with inflation in this country. Now consider the cost of upkeep and taxes, and many homes will not cash flow positive. So minimal equity growth + negative cash flow = crap investment. \n\nIn the UK, you've got a serious housing shortage, where as here in the USA, we've got a surplus of housing in most parts of the country. Certainly in the UK it would make sense to sit on a property, because the value of property is increasing way faster than inflation. Australia has a similar situation and because of that, you've got the ingredients for a much better investment.\n\nTake my father for example. He owns a home in Michigan which currently has a high unemployment rate (he lost his job back in the 00s, and has been renting the place out since 2008). It's impossible to sell the house for anything approaching a reasonable value because there's a house or two for sale on every block throughout my hometown. We're currently renting the home but it is not cash flow positive. My dad loses about a $150 a month on the property, and it is only minimally increasing in value. This is a typical scenario for most people who would try to move without selling their homes (I'd probably say 3/4 fall into this boat).\n\nIn my opinion, it's better to always have strong positive cash flow. I'd rather have an assload of investments working for me, then sitting on a house that's bleeding me out every month (that said if your market allows for you to buy a regular house and still be able to rent the same property out profitably, by all means consider buying much more strongly!). It's also important because most people can't afford to float an extra housing payment in a month. Also consider that to get raises, you typically have to change jobs, so if you want to scramble up the ladder quickly, you need to be mobile while you're young. "
"Thanks for the reply!\n\n1. I actually didn't know about these. Huh. If I get a student card now, will it stay when I'm no longer a student? If it doesn't stay, might an account lifetime of just 4 months look bad later on? \n\n2. There's no way I can afford a house, hah. I'll be living in a big city with obnoxiously high average housing prices ($2/sqft ish); I'm looking at nothing larger than a 1br/studio and trying to stick to below $1200/mo rent. I don't want to try my luck with roommates because I've had bad times in the past - it's possible if some of my friends from college move along with me (a couple of them got offers from the same place I'm going to work for), but I don't want to count on them, and don't want to room with random people. I've looked on craigslist and the prices seem about the same for the same square footage.\n\n3. I actually have my credit report, but I'll probably get another one when I actually start talking to landlords. Would it be fine if I did this over email, though? As I mentioned, I only get one house hunting trip and I'll probably want to look at several properties and pick one while I'm there. I want to get all the negotiating besides actually looking over/signing the lease done beforehand, both because I'll be pressed for time there and because I want to stay ahead of the other 99999 college grads who will also be looking for housing (and probably drive prices through the roof)."

I know others have difference experiences, but if you pick a good adviser and are interested in your research, grad school can be a very pleasant and rewarding experience.

Don't close it even after you get a regular card later since closing accounts can negatively affect your credit score.\n\n2. Fewer people are total jerks once you get out of college and it's hard to not save money by having roommates.  And if you're not on the lease, it's relatively easy to move.  Good luck either way.\n\n3. Depending on which city this is, it may be very hard to find a place remotely and you might be surprised by how bad some places are compared to the photos, but there's no reason why you can't do it.

See if PenFed will let you join as a member from Puerto Rico.  You would need to make a small donation to be eligible, but you don't need to be military or government like with USAA and NFCU.  They're good, they even have a branch at Fort Buchanan.\n3. Try a credit union based in Puerto Rico.  Try searching by zip code on [mycreditunion.gov](http://www.mycreditunion.gov/pages/mcu-map.aspx).  Caribe Federal Credit Union and PR Federal Credit Union look like two of the larger ones.

I also have some eating habits that some would find rather...*peculiar*. I tend to cook a meat-and-veggie-based \"Soylent Green\" of sorts and eat it every day (my food processor gets a lot of mileage).

"The amount contributed during this year upsets the equation.\n\nFor instance, imagine you were newly hired on Jan 1, 2013, and ended up contributing an equal amount to the 401k every month.\n\nFirst, the latter months are more important than the earlier months; in particular, in January, you only had 1 month's worth of funds, but in December, you have 12 months' worth.  So December is 12 times more important (in terms of returns) than January.\n\nSecond, note that the average amount of time your funds were invested is only about half a year.  So generally speaking, you should only expect half the annual return.\n\nThese factors diminish as your 401k grows in value, because after each year, an increasing percentage of the 401k is already invested at the beginning of the year, and your yearly contribution makes up an increasingly smaller portion of the 401k."

"Like you, I read the book and just went \"meh\". \n\nBooks like The Richest Man in Babylon, in my opinion, offered much more realistic and practical lessons for \"becoming rich\" than The Millionaire Next door. \n\nOne of the problems I saw in the book is that the paradigm it uses isn't as realistic today as it was from say, the 1800s to the year 2000. In fact, I would say from the 1800s to 1990. \n\nMuch of it's \"hey, do this and you'll be great!\" doesn't work as a model today. \n\nWe're far more responsible for our own wealth today than in the past. I mean, my father was a public school teacher, my mom and stay at home mom. They raised two kids and put them through college. This is hardly the recipe for becoming rich, yet they're millionaires today (in terms of net assets). \n\nBut the path they chose in the 60's though the 90's isn't really viable today. Not when the average person spends just 4 years at a job before changing companies, there's no retirement pension plans anymore, etc etc.\n\nSo yes, I felt the book was a bit out of date too. "
"Don't buy a house. It's not categorically more cost-effecting than renting, since there are a lot of costs associated with owning a home. If you want to live debt-free, don't purchase a house. Either that, or buy a house somewhere where it isn't terribly expensive. You can buy a house in the midwest for about 30k. You can buy a house in Indonsesia for much less. I'm with you on the debt free thing, but you need to make some sacrifices to achieve that."

The main point of the book wasn't the trivia about car buying or professions, it was the idea of UAW vs PAW (under-accumulators of wealth vs prodigious accumulators of wealth) and the different concepts of acquiring wealth vs overspending to appear wealthy.  It's wrapped in details that were current at the time."
"I feel like a broken record here:\n\nRenting is *not* \"throwing away money.\"  Whether you pay rent or a mortgage, you are buying a place to live.\n\nWhen you rent, you buy these things that a mortgaged property owner does not have: Flexibility to move on no more than one year's notice (and generally less since most leases allow you to move once a new tenant has been found).  Maintenance is outsourced to your landlord and is not your financial responsibility.  Cash outlay is much lower with renting, which frees you up for other investments.\n\nWhen you rent, you lose these things that a mortgaged property owner has: Participation the appreciation of property value, if it happens.  Ability to make fundamental or drastic changes to your living unit.  Certain tax deduction for expenses like property tax and insurance that are only tangentially related to your rent price.\n\nBuying or renting is a decision that is 75% \"sound business investment decision\" and 25% \"emotional investment in how you want to live your life.\"  Ultimately, if you want to buy a house and can afford the payments, buy one.  If you don't, don't.  If you want to rent for your entire life, go for it.  My parents owned their home for 25 years, left it, and now rent and couldn't be happier.  (For what it's worth, I now own a house after 12 years of renting.  The decision was unrelated to the cost of renting.)"
"&gt; 230k to 290k represents almost exactly 3% per year over 8 years, which is close to the typical inflation rate in the USA.\n\nYep.

"I'd like to both be completely out of debt (roughly $10k left, student loans), and keep maxing out my wife &amp; my Roth IRAs.

"Yep.\n\n\nBut after living here for 10 years, (and if I owned this house, I would have no plans to move anytime soon) I would be in a much better financial position had I bought 10 years ago.

(Actually, I didn't pursue it hard enough, and only learned later about all the crazy mortgages going on that I probably could have participated in.)\n\nOne of the services I paid for (mobility) over the past decade is something I never used, and never really considered using.

"You cannot own a credit card. Thinking that you can is a bad way to go about seeing them.\n\nA credit card is a tool that provides some financial protection behind what cash or a debit card provides and can provide things like rewards. It also give you the ability to go into debt, which you do not need to do to  build credit.\n\nThis tool can be taken away from you by the issuer at any time and for any or no reason at all, hence why seeing it as something that you own isn't accurate.\n\nUse it to build credit, but don't pay for interest or carry a balance. For best results and to maximize your FICO score, pay off all but 1-3% of the balance BEFORE the statement cuts every month.\n\nYou may need to start with a secured card from your local credit union. Same rules apply, but you'll put up a small amount of cash to secure the card. Use it responsibly and you'll build a credit score that will get you unsecured cards in the future."

"I feel like we've been over this before, but while that chart does a great job of explaining the tax benefits/penalties of getting married, it has absolutely nothing to say about using the filing status of married filing separately.\n\nCompared to filing jointly, married filing separately is almost never going to result in a lower tax burden. All of the tax brackets are precisely half that of filing jointly, and many tax deductions/credits are either half, or even lower.\n\nMy understanding is that the main reason to file separately is to take advantage of peculiar legal situations. For example, by filing separately in a non-community property state, you can potentially avoid having the other spouse's wages garnished for back taxes. Or if you have student loan debt discharged, you can avoid creating a large tax liability for the higher-earning spouse. (IANAL, this is just my understanding)."

I'm not sure if I want to afford maxing that out just yet, but my goal for this coming year is to do so going forward.\n\nIs your goal realistic? That would depend on the other factors in your life. How expensive is your housing? Student loans? Transportation? For example, my student loan payments are pretty high, and I live in a fairly expensive neighborhood because I enjoy being able to walk to work (also keeps the transportation costs down), otherwise I might have hit the maxes much earlier.

Most things in life change, and its quite possible that your career 10 years from now will be completely different.  You may get opportunities down the road once you have more experience - opportunities that aren't available to you now.  If you're financial more secure, you're more likely to take a leap on a new, exciting but uncertain and \"unsafe\" project.  Ask most 60 year-olds and they'll tell you that where they are at the end of their careers is completely different from where they started or where they though they'd end up.\n\nEither way: good luck.  Let us know what you decide. \n\nAnd Happy New Year!\n"
"If you read that book with a \"what should I do?\" mindset, indeed you will find \"It basically states you should earn a large income and save most of that using techniques that every financially literate person already knows.\"\n\nWhen I recommend it (and I suspect when it is recommended on this sub), it is to counter someone's misinformed ideas about what it means to be a millionaire.  That is, if your mindset is \"I could never be a millionaire\" or \"millionaires are either greedy misers or lucky celebrities\" then the book might change your mind, even 20 years later.  The title is, I think, trying to suggest that you might live next door to a millionaire and not know it.  That people who, on the surface, look pretty much the same as normal americans, actually have achieved financial independence.  Yes, you need to earn a high income and reduce your expenses, but \"high\" might be a lot lower than you think, and it might not devastate your lifestyle to dramatically reduce expenses.\n\nHaving said all that, I agree that the stats are old, so the book is probably not nearly as interesting as it was when I read it ~10 years ago, at least not to a general audience.

"Any debts he owed are still owed by his estate, meaning whatever money and property he owned.  One of the legal duties of the executor/executrix of his estate is to pay off such debt with whatever is left of the estate.  Only way they're not paid is if there is nothing in the estate worth anything to pay with.    \nOnce all obligations of the estate are covered, then and only then can any distributions/inheritances take place.  \nAs someone else said, tho, there can be exceptions depending on what type of debt, and state law.  \nIf it really is \"a fair amount of money\", it might be worth it to hire an attorney to help.\n\n"
"It's a good thing to try to develop good financial habits.  Keep it up.\n\nA credit card can be a useful tool if you use it responsibly by paying off the full statement balance before the due date, each and every month. They let you:\n\n- Build a good credit history so you can qualify for loans and get better interest rates\n- Pay for stuff without using cash, buy things on the internet more easily, etc.\n- [And more...](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/10/credit-card-debit-card.asp)\n\nThat being said, I would wait until college.  There are solid student cards that you can get then.  You'll have plenty of time to build your credit score by paying bills on time throughout college.\n\nHaving $30k in credit card debt is probably not a good indicator of responsible use.  If you find yourself doing into credit card debt frequently for emergencies (real or not), it's likely that you don't have a sufficient emergency fund.  By \"debt\", I mean carrying a balance month-to-month.  (If you pay off your credit card bill in full each month, then there's no interest although you are still technically in debt temporarily.)\n\nThere's a [section in the FAQ on credit cards](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/faq#wiki_on_credit_and_cards) that you might find interesting and I would also suggest reading the sidebar article about emergency funds.\n"

There's several ways you can budget, but [zero-based budgeting](http://www.gettingfinancesdone.com/blog/archives/2006/08/how-to-create-a-zero-based-budget/) works best for me. You can start budgeting on paper, in excel, or using a program like YNAB (which is a zero-based budgeting program). \n\nWrite down how much you make each month after taxes and start subtracting all your expenses one by one (rent, utilities, student loan payment, etc). Don't forget irregular bills car registration, etc which can be broken down into monthly chucks by diving by 12. \n\nObviously, you don't want what you need to spend to be more than you actually make. That's how you get into debt. If you find that it is you need to start making cuts to your expenses (spend less on food, get rid of cable or gym, get a cheaper cell phone, move to a cheaper apartment or get a roommate, etc). If you are exactly spending what you make, but do not have any money you can use for saving then you have to follow the same prescription and look for things to cut/ways to get your expenses BELOW what you make so that you will have some extra money that you can save."

"To me I think the book mainly breaks the idea most people have about what it takes to become wealthy and what wealthy people are like. I think it is showed that in addition to making a good income, having very modest spending habits is one of the most important things you can do to put yourself on a fast track to building wealth. I think it shows that being wealthy is not what most people think it is. It is not going out and spending money on wasteful things. It is a lifetime of living below your means and investing the difference. \n\nSome of the statistics are addressing correlation and not causation so some of them should not really be taken to seriously (regardless of how accurate they still are). \n\nThe point is that if you want to become wealthy you need to work for it and get over what our culture has trained us to do. Don't go buy expensive clothes, buy what you need at Walmart. Wealthy is working hard and living like you earn a much smaller income, not spending like crazy and living like you have a much higher income. \n\nIt reminds me of the part in The Departed where they ask Leonardo DiCaprio's character if he wants to be a cop or does he want to look like a cop.\n\nI would still recommend the book, but it would be at the bottom of my list."

"I would say more like 10-20% max on your card but lower is always better. If your card has a lower limit on it then you should pay it off more frequently to keep it down. I know this doesn't really matter except right before your statement is processed, but don't start playing a game like that. Having any significant balance is a horrible habit to get in to.\n\nALWAYS pay it off completely every month. If you can't do this you should not have a credit card. \n\nUse it like you would a debit card, if you don't have money to buy something already TOUGH. \n\nDo you have an emergency fund of 6 months' expenses to cover emergencies? If you not you should focus on that before you start using a credit card (you can get the card just don't use it until you have the emergency fund). This will prevent you from getting yourself in to trouble by using your credit card as an emergency fund.\n\nNo annual fee and at least 1% cash back on everything would be ideal. "

Just because a company has no competition doesn't mean that it will hit it big or that there won't be competition soon. \n\nSecondly, that 85k salary for Company A sounds good but make sure that you look at the cost of living wherever it is. It sounds like a lot but you can quickly burn through that if you are talking about living downtown, especially in California.\n\nAll in all, I would say that as long as you can afford to live with reasonable comfort, you should take the job that you are the most passionate about. Which sounds like Company A. \n\nPersonally, I went the non-startup route, but I did so because that was the company that fit my passions the best. \n\n "

We'll be able to do both of those things without taking out any loans or touching our savings. So 2014 is more medical based than 2013, but it will still be a great year. A lot of people would say to push those off until we are debt free, but a lot can be said for having a better quality of life first. We are paying a significant amount extra on my student loans, so we'll get there."

Especially not in a way that you are used to living at home where every cent of what you earn goes toward your own pleasure.\n\nSo I think you have to make a choice between the comfort/rules of your parent's home or the freedom/struggle of striking out on your own and then find some peace with whichever decision you make.  Maybe you can find your situation at home to be more tolerable once you have made a conscious decision to stay there because you have weighed your options and decided it's in your best interest. \n\nGood luck.\n"
"When you get a mortgage, sure you owe someone money and a fuckton of interest.  However, paying off that debt leaves you with property that most likely is worth more than you paid for it.  \nHaving a larger down payment reduces the debt (and thus the interest).  \nAlso you can buy homes cheap in terrible neighborhoods and at foreclosure auctions.  The house will be crap and need a lot of work for a small financial gain, but you can also stop paying anything except for insurance and property taxes.\n"

"I've been in your exact position, just with less debt.  \n\nThat being said, I'd do this.\n\nGet a firm emergency fund.  Do not touch this for anything.  Not for an engagement ring.  Not for a down payment on a house.  Nothing.  Leave that alone in an online account.\n\nYour monthly bills are probably closer to $3000 when you figure in incidentals, right?  Next December that will jump to $3500 once your student loan payment doubles.  I would use any remaining funds at the moment to pay down your highest interest rate student loan debt.  Once that is gone, balance paying down the loans with saving a proper down payment on a home, if you are so inclined.\n\nI would max your 401k.  You're in the painful tax bracket for a single guy.  Trust me, I'm right there with you.  You need every tax sheltered dollar you can get at the moment.\n\nDon't take offense to this, but educate yourself on owning a home.  It takes one market slip, one shitty neighbor, one heating and air unit to go out to put you back several months (if not more).  You honestly are not building much equity for the first 5-7 years of your mortgage when you factor in extra taxes, hoa fees, maintenance, etc.  \n\n&gt;&gt; I feel like that is many many thousands of dollars in rent that isn't being put to good use.\n\nGet that out of your mindset.  Now.  Renting is exchanging money for a place to live.  It takes all the burdens of home-ownership and places it on someone else.  That comes at a price.  Renting allows you the flexibility to up and move at a moments notice.  Do not lose sight of that, especially at your young age.  What happens when your soon to be wife, who is about to graduate, gets a job offer 3 states away?  You wouldn't want to own a home then.  I can tell you that from experience.\n\nIf rent is money that is thrown away, then so is:\n\n* Mortgage interest\n\n* Maintenance costs\n\n* Property taxes (this is easily shrugged off if you've never owned a home, but think of it as giving 1.5% of your home back to the county every year. Would you invest in a mutual fund with a 1.5% expense ratio?)\n\n* HOA dues\n\n* Homeowner's insurance\n\n* Time spent on house-related chores\n\n* Any cost or lost opportunity that results from not being able to \nmove to a different city as easily\n\n* Any realtor fees for selling the home (easily 6% of the sale price)\n\n\nNote that only one item on that list goes away when you finish paying off the house.\n\nEither shit or get off the pot with the girl you're dating.  8 years is along time to be in a relationship with someone and not get married.  Have you talked to her about your (and soon to be her) student loan debt?  Is she aware that once you sign on the line, that debt becomes hers?  Does she have the same financial goals that you do? \n\nSave up for a 20% downpayment on a home that is no more than 2.5X your current salary.  You'll thank me later on when you do put that 20% down and have a mortgage payment that is actually manageable.  Understand that this might be a year or three off.  That's okay.  There will still be plenty of homes to buy and plenty of people to sell.  It makes no financial sense for you to get into a home now when you don't have a proper emergency fund, a proper downpayment, are young (and unmarried), and have the kind of student loan debt you do.  You're at the age where your life can change in an instant and all that owning a home does at the moment is tie you down to a specific location and add an extra liability that you don't need at the moment.\n\ntl;dr...read the above."

"Absolutely--which is why I made the comment about taking the previously invested dollars and making a lump sum payment to the mortgage.\n\nMeaning, for the next 5 years I may be better off parking that money in investments vs. extra principal pay downs, because it's hard not to beat 2.5% over 5 years even investing conservatively.  But, perhaps in 5 years I will say, shoot, I can't reliably beat 4.5% with these investments (seems doubtful, but you never know) and so I will cash them out and dump them into the mortgage to drop the principal.  \n\nThe idea is that just because the dollars are invested does not mean they are not available to pay down the principal later.  As long as beat whatever the interest rate is, I am ahead... and if I see a point in time where they are not--maybe in 10 years when I potentially adjust up to 6.5% on my mortgage, I will dump all the dollars in the mortgage and see immediate relief on the interest owed."

I matriculated in to a PhD program, partly because I wasn't sure what to do next... I wanted a doctoral-level degree, and liked the idea of having dedicated time to research and learn.\n\nAfter a year in the program, I realized I just couldn't afford it.  I had a stipend that would barely cover my mortgage, car, insurance, and food, so I took out loans to supplement.  This cut into all of the things that I do for fun... so, pretty much all I could afford to do is study and work (which, I guess, is sorta a good thing).\n\nI got offered a job making dramatically more in my industry, and realized that it was the kind of job that I'd love to get after I finished my PhD... so, I took it.  I haven't dropped out of my program, but am pursuing it part-time... and the salary increase allows me to afford to pay out of pocket for the courses.\n\nThe job has actually opened more doors for me than the grad school... and I haven't really looked back on that decision.

"\n&gt; Do you recommend paying off the low interest student loans in full, or riding them out for a while?\n\nAt 2% interest I'd definitely pay them off slowly and maximize your other savings. You'll get way more than 2% returns overtime if you invest that money."

"He's not lying. His post did get downvoted. It was a post about how much better he could have done investing in highly volatile roller-coaster stocks like Netflix and Tesla instead of low cost mutual funds. A post like that is generally bad advice for a newbie or even a novice investor. Yes, you can get lucky once in awhile and lock in massive gains, but most people don't have the knowledge about how business works from a financial perspective to understand whether or not a company has good solid management with years of sustainable growth ahead. I've seen investments in firms with real solid \"this is the future\" business plans only to see them drop 50% the next year while the S&amp;P chugs along at 20% gains. Advising people to invest in risky stocks is not what this sub is about. That is for r/investing if you want to discuss that. For your average Joe trying to get his feet off the ground and into retirement investing, the safest strategy with a long term goal of sustainable growth is to invest in broad index funds and leave it alone. That's why you got downvoted. This kind of speculation, while it does have its place, is just likely to confuse people and steer them in a direction they're not prepared for. "

"I would recommend setting aside a small emergency fund before paying down the credit cards. Dave Ramsey recommends a $1000 fund and I think I can agree. $1000 is enough to help you with the most common emergencies (car breaking down, paycheck being late, a co-pay at the doctor's office or for an antibiotics treatment, etc). \n\nAfter that, sure, go all out on your debts. The best strategy is to pay as much as you can as soon as you can; and: to start with the debt with the highest interest rate, that will make you debtfree soonest and with the least amount of interest paid. \n\n(http://unbury.me could help you with showing why this \"avalance\" method is better than the \"snowball\" method where you pay your debts down from smallest to largest. You can toggle between the two methods and see which one will make you debtfree soonest).\n\nGlad you \"woke up\" and saw the amount of trouble you're in, and lots of good luck. "

"I'm no expert, just trying to give you a fresh unbiased opinion. That's my disclaimer ;-)\n\nThe only *logical* way to achieve self sufficiency is to have an income greater than expenditure, so that there is something to save for the future (emergency fund etc.). This means either increasing income or reducing expenses.\n\nThis means if your mother can't survive on her income, she needs to increase her income with additional work (i.e. a second job, welfare), or by reducing expenditure. The only way you can reduce expenditure is to have an accurate break-down of what she spends at present. This is why I suggested budgeting with her. You'll need to go through bank statements and measure her spending habits as they are, at present. You'll soon find what is spent on essentials vs non-essentials. From this you can devise a strict budget to cover her needs, any additional finds should go to building an emergency savings fund. If her needs are greater than her income, then she has an income crisis.\n\nIt's important at this point to assess what is really *essential*. Maintaining a certain level of comfort that she is used to (for example) is not essential. If she is truly unable to maintain even a basic livelihood, then she will need welfare of some sort.\n\nThis is *not* you. It sounds heartless and mean of me to say, but you cannot keep paying for their deficiencies. I say this for a number of reasons: 1. by helping them, you risk making them dependent on you, and this is totally unsustainable (especially as they get older, the most expensive years in anyone's life); 2. this will damage your relationship - if they even feel like doing something like letting lose and spending a bit on vacation, you'll probably be upset as they are doing it on your dime, or they will feel to guilty to do so and resent you for 'restricting them'; 3. There is already a government welfare system they can use if absolutely necessary.\n\nI know this isn't stellar advice, but there are two things that remain constant: **income** and **expenses**. Measure this, budget to the pound/dollar, come up with a game plan. If they are adverse to this, then the problem is more behavioural than financial.\n\nI'm somewhat *cold* in suggesting you don't help them financially because it isn't really help. It's enabling for the short term, a waste of your money, and most likely leads to conflict. You're better helping them with budgeting, and applying for jobs, etc. This is really harsh: some people need to hit rock bottom to change. I'm saying this to protect you. It would be tragic if you ended up supporting your parents at the determent of your own life and development, when there are other, more productive methods available for them. Blood is thicker than water and all, but this is a matter of teaching them to fish instead of giving them a fish.\n\nI hope my layman opinion helps give you some level of clarity (whether you think I'm crazy or not ;-), good luck!!)."

A PhD is going to grind you up, spit you out, and do it over and over again - it is not for those who don't have a deep passion for the work.  I make enough money to survive ok on my stipend and health insurance, but I don't even think about how much I'm making vs my colleagues with PhDs or those who went into industry from undergrad.

"Market timing is a terrible idea and a dangerous and losing game.  Quoting from *A Random Walk Down Wall Street:*\n\n&gt; An investor who frequently carries a large cash position to avoid periods of market decline is very likely to be out of the market during some periods where it rallies smartly.  Professor H. Negat Seybun of the University of Michigan found that 95 percent of the significant market gains over the thirty-year period from the mid-1960s through the mid-1990s came on 90 of the roughly 7,500 trading days. If you happened to miss those 90 days, just over 1 percent of the total, the generous long-run stock market returns of the period would have been wiped out. The point is that market timers risk missing the infrequent large sprints that are the big contributors to performance."

"The 52 week money plan that I saw was a pretty weak excuse for a savings plan. Don't save your money according to some arbitrary plan, save according to a personalized budget!\n\nThe first thing you need to do as a server is get an idea of how much money you're actually making. Make an excel spreadsheet to track your tips. When I worked a tip position, I tracked all my tips and always paid close attention to the average. I tracked my tips by the month so that I also knew my tip income every month.\n\nYou can start budgeting now, but you'll almost definitely be tweaking it once you get these figures together on what your income actually is. Personally, I would try to cook more to cut down food costs, but if you'd rather not do that, then budget for it. Figure out all your expenses (don't forget entertainment!) and save the rest. Saving a small amount each week sounds easy because *it is easy*. If you save that little, you'll spend the rest of your money and forget what on.\n\nI really improved how I handled my money when I started tracking tips.

For example, 3% of annual income.\n\nBased on that example, even if you max out early (or start late), you are entitled to a match of 3% of your total salary... in which case your employer may need to contribute extra money at the end of the year to hit the match."
"I definitely agree with you, but think OP may not be seeing the emergency fund as a survival kit, but a safety net. Landing in a safety net saves your life, but the fall is scary as hell.

You would still be smart to put money in up to the match, because the match will very likely cover any fees and then some. \n\nExample: you put in $4000 during the year, your employer matches 50% so $2000; fees are 1.5%; then the fee is less than 1.5% x $6000 (because it would only be exactly 1.5% if you had put all the money in on Jan 1st and it would have been sitting there for a whole year) or $90; so you are still $1910+ richer, money that you wouldn't have received if you hadn't put in the money in the 403b.

"Because it's outlined in the contracts, and anyone who takes equity in a company better have contracts in place.\n\nAlso, why would anyone just assume that their equity would dilute to a less amount over time, that makes no sense whatsoever.  If I'm being offered 2.5% of a company to join, then I expect to have 2.5% of the company when all is said and done.  (Of course, there are always vesting periods, and other terms.)\n\nGenerally founders will have a set amount, and anyone they trade equity for work, that is the payment.  A portion of the equity of the entire company is set aside for investors, generally 15%-40%.\n\nThe most common scenario I see is the founder will start off with 100% equity, and they'll bring on a co-founder or two at around 10%-20% each, which leaves the original founder with 60%-80%.  (There are of course incubators and accelerators that'll take a small slice for you to set up shop.)  During a seed round, 15% is generally up for grabs, which comes out of the original founder's, leaving them with 45%-65%.  Then you have the Series A and B rounds, at which point the original founder generally gives up even more.\n\nAt the end of the day, the original founder usually only ends up with about twice as much equity as any other co-founder, and VCs will run when they cross those founders who expect to retain more than 60% equity in their company (and is also why most startups fail.)\n\nTo attract investors, I lay out my game plan, and let them know from the get-go that I'm only expecting to have 30% equity in any of my companies at the time they sell, or when transfer of control takes place.  Generally the CEO I hire on in the early phases will have the same equity stake, with the understanding that when the remaining 40% is already owned by investors, our 30% each dilutes further.\n\nI (and the CEOs I vet) need to understand that it's better to have 15%-30% of a billion dollars, than 100% of nothing.  Egos and the power-hungry-control-freak attitude are not acceptable.\n\nI just realized that I went off on a different little rant... but I'm going to leave it.\n\nOh, one last thing, co-founders should never join a pre-Series A startup for less than 10% equity, unless they're giving you a salary that pays current market levels.  After Series A funding, if you can get anywhere near 5%, then you've either found a sucker business owner, or you have incredible negotiation skills; Chances are, you found a sucker."

The day you actually contribute \"could potentially be a particularly bad time\" as well.  You have no way of knowing.  Market timing doesn't work.\n\n&gt;The regular potential pitfalls of lump sum investing\n\nAnd what are those?  Lump sum statistically and intuitively outperforms DCA."
"Uhhh, it actually talks about spendIng less than what you earn.  A lot of the book talked about why high earners weren't necessarily millionaires."
"Education debt is not reported on the FAFSA and has no impact on your expected family contribution. You could have $50,000 in student loans or no student loans and your EFC would be the same, all else being equal. Debt is only taken into account as far as it reduces the value of a reportable asset. For instance a mortgage against a piece of real estate reduces the reportable value of the real estate. A debt that is not directly against a reportable asset is not taken into account on the FAFSA (note: car loans don't count, since cars are not a reportable asset).\n\nSo paying off your loans will not result in you getting less aid money. If anything, it could lead to more aid money, since your assets will be lower."
"&gt; I should probably start using my money on experiences. I never got to enjoy my time as an undergraduate.\n\nThen I bet you won't enjoy it any more as a PhD.  I think higher education is often overrated (coming from someone with a lot of it), and unless your goal is to do something that can only be done by getting that advanced degree, then don't do it.  If you want to challenge yourself mentally, there are a lot of ways to do it either through your career but also through hobbies and side projects."
"To be honest, I could have found a cheaper house to use as an example, but it still would have probably been at least $350k.  The one I linked is not a bad example of a sort of normal suburban subdivision even so.\n\nI really do not know how a lot of people afford their houses.  Salaries and wages are among the highest in the nation in the area, but it's not like everyone is earning 3X what similar jobs pay elsewhere.\n\n"
"Germans are somewhat stupid when it comes to money. \n\nThey use bank account (Tagesgeld, Festgeld), lebensversicherung(life insurance). Would not recommend Rürup or Riester which are somewhat similar to the 401k and Roth IRA but with very bad rules compared to them. Would only recommend Riester if you want to stay in the EU for your entire life. \n\nWhat I really would recommend is to get a Depot from either Comdirect/Cortal Consors/DAB Bank. And buy stocks/ETFs. The tax situation there is simple. Everything above 801€ gets taxed with 26,375%. \n\n"
"&gt; Just because you think of path #1 as boring, easy and unchallenging doesn't mean that it really is - or that it will be forever.\n\nTo add to that, not only may the work become interesting and challenging, you have to remember the other things that can be going on in life.  If the OP has a family and children, that will add a whole new layer of challenge and complexity, and having financial stability would be a nice thing to have."

"Cool. Thanks for your input. Hopefully it'll be a pretty painless process. I assume all of my student loans are personal? Pretty much all I have are student loans, both private and federal, and credit cards, one medical bill. I know the student loans won't matter since they can't be discharged, but I hope the fact my astronomical monthly payments factor into the case. "
"I was offered 2.5% of class B shares the first full time engineer at a tech startup in a non-tech city.  I didn't do much research before I accepted the position because I was more concerned with securing a job (I was laid off at my previous position because the company ran out of money).  I'm approaching 3 years, in which 75% of my shares will be vested, and I'm wondering now, if we do make an exit (the founders explicitly stated this as their goal), how much money I could potentially make with the percent I own.  My employment came before the seed round of funding, and we've gone through 2 rounds since."
"You're already paying significant child support, and contributing to your child in other ways.... dare I ask, could you negotiate splitting daycare costs with your ex? That additional $500/month is killing you, and it seems to me that expenses like that are exactly what child support payments are for."
"Understood... "
"Well I think that not only is this startup unique, but it's something that many, many people want, and has basically free advertising... That sounds hokey and too good to be true, unfortunately I can't really say more than that. Maybe in a PM, if you're interested. \n\nIt's also a WFH job, so I'd be living where I'm at. 85k is quite comfortable here. Thanks for your response! "

"Okay, second question... how old is the child? Do you foresee daycare expenses ending in the near future? If so, it might be worth taking advantage of the rent-free situation until then, since things will remain tight as long as you have that expense.\n\nYour budget does not really have much fat to trim, in fact I'm somewhat impressed you've gotten it as low as you have. If you want to achieve your goals regarding your IRA, 401k and building an emergency fund, you really cannot live independently right now. You're basically living on a ~$1,600 monthly income. That amount of money does not make this easy.\n\nThough FYI, with your second budget, you can cut ~$80 from your monthly IRA contributions. The yearly maximum is $5,500, which you achieve by contributing a shade under $460/month.\n\nBut honestly I think you should continue living with your dad until you gain more income, or lose expenses (especially the daycare expense)."

"8% is very high to me, and I'd like to see her reasoning as it seems like bullshit.\n\nPersonally, for me, I would invest over paying off a 4.25% loan. I'm in a similar boat, but I have 25k in student loans spread over 8 different percentages. I'm tackling everything above 5% before saving for retirement, and then I'm paying minimums on the couple of loans below 5%. \n\nYou really have to gauge what's best for you. Do you pay off the debt as quickly as possible to get rid of the emotional weight of being in debt, or do you pay minimums in order to gain a bit more in return from the market, making a slightly better financial move?"
"&gt; Interest starts immediately\n\nYour *potential for gain* starts immediately.

"You have a good income, but are precariously short of liquidity to be considering a house purchase.  You may find it very hard to get a lender to give you a 150% loan on a foreclosure.  As far as I know those aren't done anymore.\n\nA very experienced house investor may be able to spot a foreclosure for 100k that with some work (and probably 20-30k cash) could be renovated into a 150k property, but it sounds like you do not have this experience.  I think this means your plan would be quite dangerous.  You could end up with 100k additional debt for a house worth 100k and possibly more debt if you try to renovate. Your debt load increases, and interest really is money wasted more than rent here, and houses can have expensive transaction costs that you also have to pay both buying and selling."

"Maybe I misunderstand a foreclosure and how it relates to home value.  I was under the impression that if you buy a foreclosure, you're just buying it for the amount still owed to the bank/lender, but the actual value of the property could be higher.  The difference would be where I would try to get an equity loan of some kind to pay off debt.\n\nHaving a house would be nice, but really my focus is on eliminating debt as best as possible.  It just seemed like perhaps I could attempt both.  If I understand what you're saying, it is either highly unlikely I'll find a home for sale that is worth 150k and buy it at 100k, or I'll not be permitted to execute the plan by a lender at all?"
"Mostly seconded, but:\n\n&gt; Family status also has a huge impact on German taxes, so are you married or do you have kids?\n\nThats only important if his wife doesn't work. If she doesn't then the german tax code allows the husband to use her otherwise unused basic deduction. And thats all. Childs are only important tax-wise if OP earns quite a lot, otherwise the Kindergeld (Parents receive ~€180 per month for each child as a stipend) takes care of that.)\n\n&gt;You might also consider taking this up with /r/de[1] or /r/germany[2] . It doesn't exactly make sense for us to expect all this detailed information in any language other than German.\n\nI'm here, but i don't read either /r/de or /r/germany ...\n\n"
"This is theoretically possible, but unlikely in reality. When a home is available in the foreclosure market for $50K under its value, more experienced investors than you will realize this, pay for it in cash, fix it up and flip it. It's far tougher to buy in the foreclosure marketplace than it is in the standard housing marketplace. Unless your far more experienced in real estate than you indicate here, I think there's a greater chance of you quickly getting in over your head than there is of you finding a solution.\n\nWhat's the interest rate on your debt? Especially the credit card debt. You need to use some of your liquid assets and start getting rid of the higher interest debts."
"Get this, it will change your life."

"Okay, okay, here's a better one :P http://i.imgur.com/FSeoBme.jpg"
"Credit is a useful tool to have in one's financial portfolio. While I'm not going to suggest you need tons of credit to be financially successful, it does offer a number of advantages over debit-only. \n\nRental cars (since you're 15, this is a way off still) are much more convenient to rent using credit rather than debit. \n\nCash back/points/whatever offer benefits that wouldn't otherwise really be available sticking strictly to debit.\n\n0% financing (as long as you're mindful of how it works and the timing) frees up cash for other uses, though using offers like this require a lot of discipline to avoid interest or overspending.\n\nWhen you head off to college, it might be worth looking into a Target or Walmart store card to help start your portfolio if you shop at either of those. A student bank card is also a good start."
"&gt; Maybe I misunderstand a foreclosure and how it relates to home value. I was under the impression that if you buy a foreclosure, you're just buying it for the amount still owed to the bank/lender, but the actual value of the property could be higher. \n\nYou very much misunderstand. Generally these go to a foreclosure auction, where interested parties can bid on it. If it's sold for more than the outstanding debt, the foreclosed upon party gets the extra (minus auction fees and such). If it's sold for less, in some states banks can actually go after the foreclosed upon party for the deficiency.\n\nYou can get a good deal in this marketplace, but it's tough. You'll be going against experienced people who know what to look for in a house, and who can pay in cash up front. If it was that simple to buy a foreclosed upon house at a $50K discount everyone would do it."
"What's the benefit of getting this versus just using excell? I'm really tight on cash right now and wouldn't want to spend even 15$ if it's only a small improvement. "

If you use the Dropbox feature and the phone app, you can easily see your budget on the go. Quite handy!"
"God dammit. I bought the thing like 2 days ago."
"You're right on the flip thing.  I found a house the other day that was put up on foreclosure lists for 170k, and it was appraised last year at 280k.  The very next day it was listed on some realtor's site (not HUD where I saw it) for 220k.  It was perfect, too.  Oy vey.\n\nAnyway, credit card debt rate is 13%, which is of course real bad.  That'll be paid off in weeks (already got the plan in motion to deal with it).  The medical debt is luckily on a 0% interest payment plan, so I'm just going to ride that out.\n\nThe car loan is at 2.7, which isn't great.  Hoping to do something about that, but not sure what.\n\nThe student debt ranges, but the average is about 6.8%.\n\nWhat would be the chances of hiring a real estate expert to find the right place for me?  I'm betting they wouldn't make enough off the deal to make it worth their while.\n\nDebt is crushing, my friends.  Oh the things I would do differently if I could."

"They will sell a foreclosure for as much as they can get for it.  It may be that in the past someone paid even more for it and then the price dropped.  That's where you end up with short sales.  But it's always in the best interest of the seller to sell for as much as they can, which will be approximately market price.  If you buy one (or anything) and try to sell it to someone else, you can on average expect to get about the same as you paid, assuming there are enough buyers and sellers and they all know about the house for sale.  If this weren't so, a clever buyer would buy 150k houses for 100k and sell them for full price, making 50k instantly.  They would buy as many as they could with such a deal."

It's a shame that you missed out on the rally of approximately 30% over this year, though.\n\nIf this money is for retirement, you are doing yourself a disservice by not investing in stock markets. The sheer amount of money you would need to save in cash with minimal interest rates to fund a reasonable retirement is mind-boggling. Saving with average returns of 9% or so for 40+ years is very different from saving with average returns of 3%. \n\nI dump all my retirement savings into [the Vanguard 2055 Target Retirement Fund](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=1487&amp;FundIntExt=INT).

"Having tried all three (albeit mint briefly) I can try.\n\nWith the spreadsheet it was tedious. My father is a big Excel guy, and he gave me his spreadsheet to use. Thing was, it wasn't very pretty to look at and sometimes (to me) was downright confusing. I got into the habit of just mentally remembering all of my bills for a while.\n\nMint was nice, but I didn't really like the advertisements and they made me a bit uncomfortable with giving them my financial data. It didn't really help me plan out, for me it basically acted as a bill reminder.\n\nYNAB is the first software to actually \"click\" for me. I like how when you add transactions it looks just like a checkbook. You can reconcile what YNAB says against your bank account, and this has helped me a few times where I forgot to enter a transaction. They provide a lot of support for their software in the form of live webseminar classes, recorded powerpoint sessions (if you're like me and have a odd schedule), and forums. Undoubtedly, their approach to budgeting has helped me out. If you aren't willing to drop the $15 up front, I highly recommend checking out the free trial and maybe one of their classes to see if it is for you."

"And YNAB is a ~~$60~~ $15 (on sale) spreadsheet that spun a lack of a feature (auto-import of transactions) as a benefit.\n\nMint is free because of the targeted ads, only they're actually relatively useful. You aren't getting skewed trends, numbers, or anything based on advertising, nor are you losing out on any features unless you upgrade.  YNAB requires manual entering of all of your transactions. That isn't a \"feature\". From someone who works with data, that's a flaw in data consistency and integrity to rely on human input rather than automation."

"Yeah I know. See my other comment. Motherfucker was in jest I promise.\n\nI've used multiple budgeting methods over the years including mint, spreadsheets and indybudget. Mint is too passive, indybudget is a lot like YNAB but not as flashy/feature rich.\n"

"Already bought it. I doubt I'll regret it, it looks good."
"None of the airline cards are really scams. Some are better than others though. Typically the good ones offer a nice sign up bonus. 25K miles is the minimum I expect, but you can get 50K or even 100K with the right offer. Most cards give either 1 point or 2 per dollar spent. Spending, at a typical consumer level, doesn't really rack up miles. That strategy works better for business owners who can run thousands every month through the cards. Or employees who spend with their own cards for work and get reimbursed. \n\nThe time you should be willing to pay a fee is if the benefit outweighs the fee. Most waive it the first year anyway. But if the fee is say $99, but I'm getting 50K miles and 2 free checked bags, then that's a good deal. 2 checked bags on any major airline are going to cost at least that much. \n\nInterest rate is irrelevant because you shouldn't be carrying a balance. I have cards as low as 12% and as high as 23%. "
"It's software you run on your computer instead of on a webapp. They don't do auto-retrieval of your accounts via the web, so you must manually import exported CSV files from your banks online banking, or hand enter everything yourself.\n\nI switched to YNAB a few months ago, after realizing how hard it is to budget with Mint.  Mint is also trying to sell you their 3rd party services all the time.\n\nYNAB methodology advocates that you give every dollar a \"job\", that is to know exactly where each of your dollars is going. From there, you set aside enough of a buffer so that you can pay your month's bills with money you made last month.\n\n$15 for this software is a no brainer for anyone looking to get serious about budgeting. I prefer it to Mint.com in just about every way. I bought it a few months back when it was $40 and thought I was getting a deal."

"Yeah, it's as easy as going to coinbase.com and setting up an account. It takes about a week to get your first bitcoins, but I really think it's worth it.\n\nI'm not saying bitcoins WILL blow up. However, I do think it has the potential to be the next big thing. I regret not investing when I had the chance to when it was at .13$ per coin. However, all it really takes is a few countries/investors to get on board and it could really skyrocket and stabilize."

"Even at $15, I have a hard time justifying purchasing what is essentially a spreadsheet."
"Do want to ask this, can't I just keep track of what goes in and out as I use it? Or does this application also budget future transactions you plan on making? I just don't know if it's a time saver or if it does more than what I'm thinking."
"Maybe you shouldn't use budget software if you don't want to know how much you're spending."
"I've never bought anything off of steam before. Is it possible to buy this software for someone else and then send it to them?"
"I'm assuming you're referring to the credit card part. Check out http://www.youneedabudget.com/support/video/handling-credit-cards-in-ynab\n\nIn budgeting programs I've used previously I've always had two accounts. Your main/checking and the credit card. \n\nThe way you budget is say you're paid $3k / month - you pay $2k to your credit card which shows an outgoing to your checking and an incoming to your cc. Leaving $1k in checking and $2k avail to the cc.\n\nNow for me I put the majority of my expenses on the credit card and pay it off each month. So in the old budgeting as long as the checking balance doesn't go down to 0 and the credit card remains below 2k you can call it good. \n\nHowever it's really hard to tell when you have a few credit cards and expenses across accounts if you're monthly outgoing expenses exceed your $3k per month income. YNAB puts it all together and just treats it all as an expense and tells you plainly what is coming in and what is going out.\n\nAn important step to getting out of the cc debt cycle is making sure you're not putting more on the card than you're paying down. A lot of people will say pay off the card in full but if you're finding out you've overspent by the time you've got your statement it's going to be too late."
"&gt;  I basically retired when I was 29\n\nThis is an awesome mindset. Very inspirational, thank you."
"YNAB did not click for me. Or maybe we did it wrong. Each Sunday, we imported the bank statement and began the laborious process of putting everything into the right category. Bleh. Nothing ever balanced, things were usually over or under, and we never did figure out how to account for $5000 cushion we wanted to keep in checking so it was always negative. The red negative had what I'm sure was the intended psychological effect, it bothered me. So, I was annoyed by it and gave up after a month.\n\nIt was worth a try for $15, I'd recommend it for that, but not for $60.\n\nMint and the direct link to the bank statement works better for me, I can see immediately where I am at any moment instead of being annoyed 1/week."
"It is mostly US-centric."
"I need a budget so badly that I don't even have $15 in my budget for ynab..."
"Can confirm; the academic track is fraught with misery. Especially if you end up in postdoc limbo for an extended period. I know more unhappy PhDs than happy ones."
"Am I the only one who is scared away from YNAB from the near cult-like \"it will change your life\" attitude towards it that almost seems fake? I mean, it may be a good spreadsheet, but I can't see how it's so much better than Mint + a Google doc spreadsheet.  After I categorized all of my Mint transactions and kept up to date, I set a budget. Watching the progress bar with the little line to make sure I'm on track with where I should be with the budget for the month has done wonders with getting my spending under control.\n\nMany of the YNAB supporters say the exact same thing: \"It will change your life\" and \"It doesn't tell you only what you spent a while ago\" in a way that seems very canned and borderline from a marketing company. \n\nThe problem is with the mentality of thinking you shouldn't care about the past, is that it makes it like you shouldn't care about your history and what's in the past means nothing. Are you getting better? How are you on track with last month? Are you actually better off than you were 12 months ago? Mint is excellent at visualizing your expenses and doing it accurately because it imports immediately down to the penny without decimal mistakes or human errors you may have manually entering it in your $60 software. \n\nAnd as far as budgeting, Mint has budgeting in it. If you *really* need manual entry, I advise you to set up a spreadsheet in Excel or Google Docs. The sidebar to this subreddit has many free spreadsheets that are very well detailed. Even at $15 on sale, it doesn't seem fiscally responsible to buy something with countless free alternatives. "

"You can buy a house in cash. Cash offers usually put you in a better position actually on a house with a lot of offers. \n\nBut I don't know why you'd want to unless you really just hate the thought of owing someone money. Mortgage rates are still pretty low. You also can't eat a home. I'd much rather owe a $1000 mortgage payment when I lose my job and have 50K in cash and investments than have no mortgage payment and no other assets. \n\nSaving up for a house also take a *long* time usually. There's comes a point where you have enough of a downpayment and you want to enjoy the benefits of a house. Financing lets you get those benefits sooner. \n\n&gt; Was there a time when one could just save and buy a small house, \n\nThis was more common, but the 30 year mortgage has been standard I believe since the 70s. The modern mortgage didn't really exist until 1930s. The government wanted to encourage home ownership and made financing easier to get. This continues today, although the terms have gotten longer and downpayments have decreased. \n\nThis is good and bad. Good because it lets people who want a home buy one, but unfortunately people often buy homes they can't really afford. The US default rate is higher than western Europe, where lending requirements are stiffer. \n\n&gt; The issue is I can live without cards \n\nCards don't have to be used for debt. Really I'm just delaying payment by 30 days. I guess technically I'm in debt for that amount of time, but it's not costing me anything so it doesn't bother me. "

"I'm going to pop in here to chime in with the exact same figure I always do:\n\n**In a case where a company \"cashes out\", the average amount of money a first engineering hire cashes out in equity is approximately a down payment on a house.**\n\nThe above figure excludes cases like Microsoft, Google, Facebook, etc. but keep in mind that those situations are like winning the lottery.  This is also only for companies that *do* have a exit.  The vast majority don't (or it's at firesale prices).  This is coming from someone who has worked at three startups, and knows more people than I've cared to mention who sacrificed large amounts of cold hard cash for equity that was worth between 0 and down payment on a house.  So that's what you're taking the chance on.  The possibility of getting a down payment on a house after N years.  Do the math and see if that gamble's worth it.  It almost never is.  Granted, if there are reasons besides money why you might be interested in the company, that's a different story.\n\nMoreover, first engineering hires are usually smart enough to start their own company.  That's what I ended up doing eventually, with no regrets.  At the end of the day, the people who make money are the founders and investors, as they actually risked capital, so they rightfully get rewarded most."

"&gt;YNAB requires manual entering of all of your transactions.\n\nThis is wrong. You can import OFX, QFX, QIV or CSV files in YNAB and never enter a transaction manually.

"This game is terrible, I've been playing it for an hour now."
"Budgeting in Mint isn't real budgeting. You are building a suggestive budget in Mint (based off of play money / monopoly money) and tracking expenses to see whether they line up or not.\n\nYNAB uses past months and future months to help you plan with money you DO have in your account. How can you budget a 200 dollar expense in January with only 50 bucks in your account? (for example). \n\nIt's a completely amazing way to visualize and plan your personal finances. For those of us who want to be COMPLETELY in control and aware, YNAB is a godsend. "

"The key difference between Mint and YNAB is that Mint helps you track what you are doing with your money... YNAB helps you develop a budget and helps you (eventually) save up a month financial buffer (you pay this month's expenses with last month's money).\n\nI have been a YNAB user for quite some time now, and it really has changed how I do finances.

There is no need to impose limits on yourself in the form of prepayment.  You also lose out on potential cashback rewards by refraining from using the card. \n\nAs for my Amex blue, I use it for all expenses, and am in a state of always buying, and always paying.  I always have a balance (which helps build credit), but never ever pay any fees or interest on it. Here is my last two statements: http://i.imgur.com/mBOqSz8.png http://i.imgur.com/Ajw87hL.png\n\n"
"It's a budget program. Not an expense tracking website. That's the difference. \n\nManually entering requires you to take a hands on, proactive approach. Think back 30 years when people would balance their checkbooks. If you are THAT strapped for time and don't care about being hands on with your money, you can auto import transactions whenever you want from excel files that banks offer you to download.\n\nBudgeting isn't an automated process that you just log in and \"watch\" your money. \n\nMint.com is hoping you get stronger by looking at weight. YNAB is manually lifting weights. "
"&gt;  It's safe.\n\nI'm giving my credentials for my financial institution to a 3rd party who I am supposed to \"trust\" that they aren't logging that information somewhere. The credentials which if someone gets a hand on can completely flush my account of all my assets. If the bank finds out that I gave my credentials to a 3rd party there is a very good chance that I won't be covered by the insurance they normally offer because it was lack of diligence on my part.\n\nPaying 15.00 - 60.00 for the peace of mind knowing that my financial credentials haven't gone through a 3rd party is worth it to me."
"Exactly. For my spreadsheet, I have about a dozen monthly bills and my income. It's *very* basic, but if I wanted I could expand it more to allocate my leftover money.  When I get back from a business trip or a week out of town, I can't imagine going through and inputting each and every transaction manually and accurately.  If there were tips involved, my receipts may not accurately show them and I'd have to wait for them to clear in my bank to see exactly what I tipped.\n\nFor someone who puts everything on plastic (debit), manually entering all of the transactions can quickly become messy and inaccurate even if I tried. Book keeping and balancing your checkbook should not be something we should bother doing in this era. It's not a feature, don't buy YNAB's excuse for not having automation."
"I'm not even sure what ads people are talking about. I'm looking at my mint.com right now. I see a small section for \"Advice\", and if I scroll all the way down, some \"Ways to Save\". I don't choose to examine either of those right now, but they're hardly obtrusive. I believe they would add value if I were interested in investigating."

"&gt; They don't do auto-retrieval of your accounts via the web\n\nWait, so I would have to manually input every transaction I make... every damn time? Seems like a huge waste of time compared to automatically importing the account information like mint. \n\nEverything else about the software looks awesome, but this is a deal breaker. "
"Seems like a lot of the financial websites have you put in a percentage of your check as a deduction. When I had the same concern, I called our HR company and requested they deduct/contribute a flat dollar amount - $17,500/26 paydays is ~673.07/payday. It starts next week, but they didn't seem to have an issue with doing it this way. "
"Sounds like you've already made up your mind.  When people find something that has a significant impact on their lives, they like to talk about it.  \n\nIf you're skeptical, YNAB offers plenty of videos and FREE webinars on using the software and how it's differentiated from Mint, but you know, that would take time to look into. It's much easier to just speculate on the authenticity of YNAB supporters.\n\nMaybe Mint works better for your mindset, YNAB works for others. If you don't understand how investing in software that is designed for a purpose and saving a person hours of time using free alternatives, then you're lost anyway.  Continue as you are."
"Finding the export of your data from your bank is difficult sometimes (and I'm willing to bet impossible for some). Why should I have to take multiple steps to download/import this stuff for $60 software when it's done for free with Mint? YNAB saying it makes you pay attention to your transactions is a poor excuse. \n\nAlso, Mint is accessible across all computers/devices without needing to also set up a Dropbox syncing. Again, for free-- not $60."
"Not helpful at all. mint.com does a lot that YNAB doesn't do, all for free(yes there are ads). YNAB is better for those that like/need a hands-on approach or frequently use cash. \n\nGenerally when I ask people what's better about YNAB budgeting compared to mint they either mention a feature in YNAB that mint also has, or they talk about the 'mindset' which anyone can do without any software at all. \n\nThat's not to say there aren't reasons to go with YNAB. In addition to the reasons I listed above, not all banks/accounts sync well with mint. Some people are also uncomfortable handing out account information to a 3rd party. You sometimes have to wait for transactions to clear before they show up. It's easier to budget for future months in YNAB.\n\nNow, why do I like mint? \n\nIn addition to telling me what I spent awhile ago, it tells me what I'm spending right now. It does it semi-automatically. I don't have to manually enter in every single expense. I do have to go through once per week and fix items that get assigned to the wrong budget. e.g. Walmart isn't always groceries.\n\nIt keeps updated balances and transactions on every single account I own. Checking, Savings, 401k(including the individual funds and performance tracking), HSA, Student loans, mortgage, credit cards, car loan, estimated value of home and IRA.\n\nEven if you use YNAB, mint is a great way to see updated information about all of your accounts."

My status is perfectly legal, currently I work for a little above minimum wage, which is more than enough for my small apartment and everything I need, I'm single. That's why I decided to spend responsibly and do something smart with leftover money. With my current income I'm able to start to save money, and it looks like my job is going in the right direction, the company I work in is evolving, and I hope to get a promotion some time this year. As far as the social benefits, I'm not eligible for any.  \nAnd, like I wrote, I'm just looking for the place to start, because right now I'm a complete rookie, and need to be pointed in the right direction, then do my own research. Thanks for all the answers btw."
"Well you can either do it at the time of transaction by using their Android or iOS app or keep the receipt and do it when you get home. I kinda like doing that since I end up classifying it then.

"I just wanted to chime in and say I love this software and highly recommend it. \n\nWe should have been making more than enough money to get by, but were still somewhat paycheck-to-paycheck because our spending had passively expanded to fit our income. YNAB helped us buckle down on immensely on our spending and see the places where we were bleeding money. My partner was always fairly frugal, but this honestly changed the way I look at my finances. \n\nIf you've been curious about trying the software, this is the cheapest I've ever seen it. Hell, I paid full price for it earlier this year and, for me, it's been worth every penny!"
"I'm always on the look out for suspicious activity on my accounts via Mint, and YNAB doesn't accomplish that for me."
"Have you tried the free trial?\n\nJust saying, in June, I would have agreed with you 100%. I hadn't really tried it. I thought Mint counted as budgeting (hint: it's not). I have read a TON of personal finance and have used YNAB since July. I would never go back to thinking expense tracking = budgeting, thinking that you can make a budget using \"how much money I will have in the future\" instead of \"how much money do I have today\" and thinking that YNAB is a cult. YNAB works.\n\nJust try it. (Just as cults would say, haha)\n\nYNAB teaches you to look at the past and the future. YNAB visualizes expenses and is MORE accurate, since you enter everything yourself, instead of a computer (no transaction is without a category / miscategorized, no more 17 different gas stations that are all 711s, etc).\n\nMint is good for beginners, but if you really are serious about your money and planning and learning, try YNAB."

"&gt; Seems like a huge waste of time compared to automatically importing the account information like mint.\n\nIt's different, but it serves a different purpose. Mint auto retrieves so you can see where your money *went*. YNAB has you manually input, because you're supposed to make the decision *before* spending. Slightly different take, some like the one, some like the other strategy."

I have easily saved more than the $15 I paid for it in July, anecdotally. \n\nYou can walk everywhere if you plan accordingly. For some people, a car is worth spending money on to save time. For some, getting an amazing hands on budgeting and financial planning tool is worth $15. "
"&gt; Worst case scenario I learn a $15 lesson, best case I have a really good budgeting tool.\n\nAbsolutely. Given that the regular price is around $60, it's a pretty reasonable gamble to see if it works for you (assuming you don't currently have *something* that's working for you)."
"Is it so much to ask for software that can automatically grab your transactions for you and categorize them?  Manual entry is archaic"
"Guys, this thread is ridiculous. People asking questions based on common sense get downvoted and people posting single-liners praising it have a u:d ratio of 5 to 10. And then there are really well-worded posts which pop up every time someone mentions ynab or mint to kinda lean the one or the other way."
"I don't have a problem with cards really, and I don't wanna open a few accounts I don't really need (like my parents). I'm happy with my bank, I'm just looking in the future, when possible larger sum of money would just sit there, whereas it should work for me."

"Mint uses play money. Budgets are built using *current dollars* you have in your account *right now*, not \"how much money I think I will have this month\"\n\nI keep YNAB open on my desktop and every time I spend money, I spend 5 seconds entering it and categorizing on my phone, much more accurately and efficiently than Mint. It's instantaneous. I see my budget and balances change every time I spend the money. It's hard to explain how this affects your spending until you try active budgeting instead of looking at a rough monopoly money \"budget\" like on Mint."
"The smartphone app has GPS support so it will save the location of the place you're entering the transaction so that next time it will autocomplete it. It works really well, actually."
"Awesome deal -- attended one of their webinars last week and almost jumped on it then. Glad I waited. "
"&gt; When I get back from a business trip or a week out of town, I can't imagine going through and inputting each and every transaction manually and accurately\n\nI just got back from a 9 day vacation and it took me like 30 minutes to enter everything.\n\n&gt; For someone who puts everything on plastic (debit), manually entering all of the transactions can quickly become messy and inaccurate even if I tried.\n\nEverything I do is via Credit or Debit, you open up your banking site and enter stuff. Make sure it makes sense and carry on."
"Theoretically, this could work, as long as you do not have to be vested in order to pull out your employer's contribution (my old company was 6 years). And make sure you don't have to go through a long waiting period after a withdrawal before you can contribute again. \nYou may also be able to take a loan out against your 401k balance, so you could contribute enough to get some money in there, take the loan, pay off the other debt and pay yourself the interest (probably at a lower rate than the school loans) and wind up with something in your retirement account at the end. \nEither way, get that 6%. It is an instant 6% raise. Free money is free money, even if it isn't spendable right now. "
"This is what I do, and I've found it gets me thinking more about my spending as the iOS app shows me how much I have left budgeted for the category I just spent in.  Takes me about 10-15 seconds to enter a transaction on the phone."
"No, no- I get it. You need to budget every month. But I do this in a spreadsheet that allocates those expenses. I've seen a few posted here in this sub that people have said are pretty much excellent alternatives to YNAB, and even more detailed. \n\nThe thing is, it's a combination of looking at your historicals and the future. You shouldn't rely on just one tool. "
"That's one of the points of ynab, a personal responsibility for each and every one of your purchases.  Using mint it's easy to see \"oh I spent $30 on widget\" versus ynab it's easy to feel \"wow I spent $30 on widgets, that hurts\"\n\nBoth serve their purpose.  I use mint to see if I missed adding anything to ynab and a quick look at my finances. \n\nI like both pieces of software "

"Some people who care about their money deeply will pay money for a hands on planning and budgeting tool, just like some people who care deeply about their cars will pay for expensive car washes. \n\nI love reading all this criticism on YNAB from people who haven't even used the 37 day free trial. They just see spending money + no hand holding auto import and scream \"WASTE OF MONEY!\""
"&gt;Budgeting in Mint isn't real budgeting. You are building a suggestive budget in Mint (based off of play money / monopoly money) and tracking expenses to see whether they line up or not.\n\nMint *is* using your actual money, and you can set up an actual budget to see how much you're spending on what, and you can get very granular with it if you like.\n\nIf you're trying to save up for something, use the \"goals\" feature.\n\nPeople talk about YNAB as if it has some sort of magical, alternative way of managing your money. If it does, I've never found it. And they also talk about the lack of auto-import as if it's a great idea, not a missing feature."
"What about dollar cost averaging?  In Vanguard you can set up automatic monthly withdrawals based on the annual contribution limit.  Mine just carried over from last year so I'm already set for 2014."

"&gt; That's 186k, assuming married!\n\nEdit: That's right, forgot a factor of two.  Oops!"
"&gt;Mint auto retrieves so you can see where your money went. YNAB has you manually input, because you're supposed to make the decision before spending. Slightly different take, some like the one, some like the other strategy.\n\nThis seemingly minor difference makes a huge difference.  Mint has never helped me, at all.  I ended up buying YNAB after using their demo for a month.\n\nMint is great for seeing how much money you have and where it went.  YNAB is great for how much money will I have and where do I want it to go."
"In my one experience, and working with a CEO and CFO who had had several previous successful exits, it did not work the way the other poster is describing, and no one would have imagined it would. The first engineering hires absolutely had their shares diluted. \n\nSo, apparently approaches may differ and obviously one would always want to do due diligence on the details of any specific equity offer they're considering  anyway. "
"YNAB looks at your historicals and allows you to plan for the future (allocating 60 bucks a month for a car payment in 6 months, etc). \n\nIt has a lot of nifty shortcuts for budgeting based on historical 3 month, 6 month, annual, etc expenditures per category. "
"So you have to enter the transaction while you're standing in the check-out lane? I do not see that as a positive. I find people fiddling with their phones instead of getting out of my way really annoying. I'd be courteous and wait until I got home to enter things.\n\nedit: I did download the app because I really wanted to be wrong about the gps feature. Heck, people speak so highly of ynab, I want it to work. Can two apps be linked to a single YNAB account? It would seem like they should."
"&gt; It's a completely amazing way to visualize and plan your personal finances. For those of us who want to be COMPLETELY in control and aware, YNAB is a godsend. \n\nI bought it when they did the 50% black friday deal on their site after having used the demo for a month.  Was floored.  December was the first month where all my paychecks were assigned to January's budget rather than the current month.  Something I've never been able to do in Quicken or Mint."

You are talking about this as an investment.\n \n If that car were far away and would require you to get transportation to your car, would the car really be beneficial? It seems illogical to have to be transported to your transportation.  \n\nBudjet software sold on a gaming marketplace, at a high premium, just seems like targeting a market that will buy anything with a sale price on it."
"It memorized payees based on location.  If you are at the grocery store and open the mobile app it will automatically fill in the budget category and payee based on your location, and it syncs instantly to the desktop version."
"I disagree with the other posters. Unless your interest rate is unusually low for credit cards or you have no remaining available credit, it probably makes the most sense to just throw everything at your debt immediately. Worst case scenario: In case of emergency, you can use the card and be no worse off than you would be if you had saved for an emergency fund before paying. Best case: you get out from the debt sooner and cheaper and you start saving once you're debt free."

"Exactly. Or you can just turn them off in the app itself, I think.\n\nThis is a PEBKAC issue."
"Because this reddit is about developing good habits and useful knowledge for saving for *retirement*. Riding on bitcoins is speculation and gambling, which is not suited for and frowned upon in this subreddit. \n\nDo you see bitcoins as steadily increasing in value (on average) for the next 30+ years? No? Then this is not the method because that's how long one saves for retirement, if starting young. Do you expect it to rise in value then drop? Well, trying to time the high point is very risky and like gambling. If you expect it to stabalize, well you better be damn sure it's gonna stabilize at a point higher than your purchase price.\n\nAll of this has considerable more risk then diversifying your money across the entire US/European stock market through (index) mutual funds and watching that money grow steadily but surely with the economy.\n\nif everyone on this subreddit started reccomending moving your retirement savings over to bitcoins, can you imagine the calamity when this bubble bursts? \"there is some risk to it\" is a huge understatement. \n\nThe personal finance books in the faq explains the difference much better than I.\n\nedit: then again 50$ is miniscule so that's why toxicity may have reccomended bitcoins. However, I firmly believe that the personal finance books will help you out far more, if only to develop sound attitude towards saving and spending for the rest of your life. Even if you get rich, you'll still be poor if you can't hold on to that money.\n\nI reccomend \"the millionaire next door\" for insights on attitudes towards money and \"I will teach you to be rich\" for navigating US retirement investing (tho maybe the concepts there will translate over to Europe)"
"I totally agree, and I'm a huge YNAB fan. Whenever someone asks me what I'm doing when I enter stuff into my YNAB app (which I do with every purchase, usually while I wait for the CC to go through) I explain, and inevitably I'm told \"Oh, I already do all that via XXX\", while also explaining how they're so surprised by how much Christmas presents cost this year, etc etc.\n\nOne big thing I like about YNAB is either saving or owing yourself in particular categories, without needing separate accounts. I don't need to put $200 in my \"household account\" every month to know that it exists, I just have it as a category and it builds over the year until I need it. I didn't find a parallel in mint that worked for me, unless I was willing to *transfer* $200 into an account to hold it."

"People don't know how to read, that's why it's getting downvoted. \n\nIf I said it's a safe investment or guaranteed money, I'd understand getting downvoted. However, I said it has a CHANCE of being a great investment. \n\nNobody can deny it's potential and, while it is volatile right now, if people back it(which is becoming more and more popular every day), it has the possibility of being huge. \n\nPeople are just butthurt that China backed out a few weeks ago, causing a drop in value. However, China is talking about getting back into BTC and, if you follow BTC, even with the value drop it is still on an upwards trend. \n\nOnce again, I'll reiterate. BTC is a gamble, however it is a VERY high regard gamble. When the Internet was first created, investing in the Internet was a gamble. However, it was a gamble backed by something with A LOT of potential. Bitcoins is a gamble that has A LOT of potential. \n\nMore and more companies and countries are backing and accepting Bitcoins on a daily basis. All it takes is Bitcoins to go mainstream and have more people realize how INSANELY useful it is. Serious, BTC has the potential to be the biggest thing of 2014. It also has the potential to be worthless, however I think the risk is HIGHLY worth it just due to how fucking useful and convenient Bitcoins are. "
"That's correct.\n\nAccelerated cheap debt instead of investing"
"What benefits does YNAB have over just doing it by hand (like the olden days of balancing a checkbook)?  Is it just the visualization aspect that people like?"
"I think you misunderstand. It's a tool. \n\nTo move faster, some people buy tools. To budget, some people buy this tool. \n\nSome people don't value budgeting enough to justify this tool. I have plenty of friends who live without cars in the inner city just fine too, walking and saving money with the metro. The car is just a rough example. Focus less on the car example and more on the \"some people love budgeting and this program fills a purpose for those looking for an awesome budget tool\". You CAN code HTML in notepad for free. Many people buy programs for that too. \n\nAnyways. \n\nTo each, their own. "
"Usually an employee would be offered either reverse vesting shares (aka founder equity) or vesting options. In either case the agreement is technically in terms of shares not percentage.

Any non dilution clause could be a poison pill for future investors.\n\nSource: founded multiple venture backed startups on the east coast, sold one, advised others, and read lots about term sheets and compensation along the way."
"I thought this was terrible after using Mint but it really helps make you aware of your spending decisions. Compliment this with the mobile app, any purchase you make you add to it. Has saved me a lot of money from thinking about what I really need and what fits in my budget. With Mint, I just spent and looked back a month later and was like \"I wish I didn't spent so much money on x\".\n\nEDIT: I actually use both Mint and YNAB.

"Let's repeat until it sinks in:\n\n&gt; You don't give it your credentials. You authorize the bank/financial institution to give Mint a trusted certificate to access your transactions that are read-only.\n\n"
"Only for major financial institutions though. Smaller banks and credit unions don't support that.  For a long time not even ING Direct supported it and ING Direct started blocking Mint until they finished up their trusted certificate support (which took a very long time to do). If you are using Mint with smaller institutions they are still storing your username, password, and security questions on their servers."

"got it. I guess YNAB is back in the consider column. "

"This is why I think this thread is worthwhile:\n\nYNAB works fantastically well for some people. I'm not one of them, but there's copious evidence that it does. For those people, it fulfills the terms of this /r/, it assists and increases personal finance.\n\nAnnouncing that it's on-sale is worthwhile because it does bring out comments from people like me. If I'd paid $60 for it, I'd be pissed and convinced I was conned.  It really didn't work for me, but I was only out $15. It was worth a try for that in case I might have been one it did work. I've gone to bad movies and had bad popcorn and soda for $15. YNAB at least lasted a month."
"If you want to track every single expenditure or deposit as it happens, yes, but it would be less work to just put it in manually. Especially if you have the smartphone app.\n\nOn the other hand, you could just import your account statements every month, or dump partial statements weekly... But you're correct, importing a file one time will not cause the software to continue to update any future transactions."
"If you can find a service that doesn't require a minimum investment, you should be able to do it online.

You'll have to shop around. "
"Yes it does, whenever you make a transaction whether it be with cash, debit card, or credit card; you make an entry into the software either on your computer or via phone app, then you use the reconcile feature to compare it to your credit card statement. It's pretty handy for catching errors/mistakes from the bank and making sure everything is correct."

"&gt; Mint is using your actual money, and you can set up an actual budget to see how much you're spending on what, and you can get very granular with it if you like.\n\nI used Mint for years, and no, it isn't using your actual money. It's using how much money you think you'll have. There's an important, salient difference there. YNAB pushes you towards only allotting money you have where Mint pushes you towards monthly maximums. I'll agree, it isn't magical, but the implementation *is* very different from Mint's."

"&gt; Lump sum investing can be risky in the event of a market crash/fall soon after.\n\nIf you're investing money that you need in the short term, where a market crash/fall actually impacts you, then you need to *not invest that money.*\n\nIf you're investing for the long term (like making IRA contributions), then short-term market swings mean nothing.\n\nSo really, this isn't a pitfall unless you panic and take the money out, which you obviously should not do.\n\n&gt; This is why some financial gurus suggest spacing out contributions in regular intervals.\n\nResearch shows lump sum investing is better most of the time.

"Sure thing. From there the equation is actually pretty simple. Figure out your mother's monthly spending budget (how much she spends to live for things like food, medicine, transportation, etc.). Then determine if she can cut any of those numbers down (paying for cable TV? Not until your debt is gone. A $100/month unlimited data cell phone plan? A $30/month unlimited plan from an organization like Virgin Mobile will do the trick).\n\nOnce you've trimmed the budget as far down as reasonable, the surplus is what you can put towards the outstanding debt. If there is no surplus? Your mother will need to find a means of earning more income (which may be difficult considering her benefits as a disabled person).\n\nAs for the debts, you'll pay the minimum payment each month on all the debts, then put ALL the remaining funds available towards the debt with the highest interest rate. When that debt is paid, she's created a \"snowball\" effect. With a paid debt she'll have more discretionary income available to her (she no longer has that debt she paid off to worry about), and she'll put that money towards the remaining loan with the highest interest rate. Soon she'll pay that off, then repeat until each loan is paid off and all the debt is gone.\n\n(Though numbers change because you're not based in the States, the principles I've outlined here are standard pretty much anywhere.)"

"Agree 100%. I'm doing OK financially, I have mint, but I'm also just frugal with purchases in general. I'm looking through all the comments to try and find out what the \"point\" of YNAB is, and all I see is \"it will change your life\" and \"it helps you make a budget\".\n\nWell, mint has a budget feature, and I use that every couple months to keep a rough idea of how much I'm spending on things. I don't understand what YNAB does, and I don't really feel like downloading a demo and filling it out with all my financial information only to discover that it doesn't do anything (which is exactly what a lot of the downvoted comments are saying -- that it's just a spreadsheet).\n\nI want to believe, but someone needs to post an actual explanation of what makes YNAB special. I will be OVERJOYED to upvote that explanation."
"I.. do it as I'm walking away from the cashier, or in the car before I leave..\n\n&gt; Can two apps be linked to a single YNAB account? It would seem like they should.\n\nYes. The 'normal' way it works is it syncs your budget into your Dropbox account, so every device that is also synced with it will have a current copy of it. There are ways, I believe, to set it up to work with multiple Dropboxes. You can also do a Wifi sync directly."
"I found that once I started using YNAB, I actually looked at my bank transactions more often, when I reconcile my accounts. Mint became too automatic and background, and my previous \"budget\" was terrible because I only ever looked at my bank balance, not the transactions. With YNAB, I look at the transactions, actively. \n\nDifferent strokes, I guess :)"

"&gt;Why should I have to take multiple steps to download/import this stuff for $60 software when it's done for free with Mint?\n\nYou don't have to do anything. If you prefer Mint, use Mint. If you're interested in YNAB, there is a free trial. There's never any need for anybody to pay $60 - or any lesser sum - for YNAB without knowing exactly what YNAB does and doesn't do, and deciding for themselves that there's value in the purchase.\n\nPersonal finance is first and foremost about people making informed decisions based on their own priorities.

"&gt; I don't need to put $200 in my \"household account\" every month to know that it exists, I just have it as a category and it builds over the year until I need it. I didn't find a parallel in mint that worked for me, unless I was willing to transfer $200 into an account to hold it\n\nI use mint and just thought I would share my method of handling this issue in case it will help other mint users. \n\nWhat I would do in this instance is go to my budget and create a budget category labeled \"household account\". Set this category to receive $200 a month and check the box to roll over the balance each month. \n\nNow, $200 a month builds up in this category, but I don't have to move it into another account. \n\nFrom the overview page, I can scroll down to the budget section and it will give me an amount for how much is available in each category displayed as dollar amount left. So if I budget for $200 a month in my \"household account\" for 3 months and don't spend any of that, at month 4, it will display \"household account\" budget: $200 over? $800 left. (With the \"$800 left\" in green.) \n\nNow on month four if I need to make $800 worth of purchases for \"household account\" items, I just make sure the purchases are categorized as such and once those purchases are properly categorized, it will show $0 left.\n\nI like mint, and I like using it in this manner. I use it in this way to save up for those periodic expenses like car insurance. I budget a certain amount each month and let it roll over for 6 months. Then, when my payment goes through on my card, mint places it in my car insurance category and I am set back to $0 left.\n\nEdit: I also use this method for certain savings goals, such as vacation savings. I can leave the money in my main account as opposed to transferring it like you would have to with the goals section. I can check how much I have saved toward my goal by checking the budget section of the overview page.

You just transfer your money and then buy stocks/etfs/bonds or whatever you want to buy. \n\nIt's actually nothing country-specific except to know where you can get \"good\" brokerage accounts. But if you want to use them you should have some general knowledge of the financial market. Learn it in the language you're comfortable with. \n\nThe important part is what you want to invest in. Know the risks/fees/chances of certain products. Stocks and ETFs are the best products in general in my opinion, but you also have to buy the right ones, but nobody can make that decision for you. "

"You don't need to manually enter transactions.  It can import Quicken-format files (qfx).  Every financial organization these days offers the ability to download transactions for Quicken.  I spend 10 minutes every couple of weeks downloading the latest transactions from all my accounts and mass importing them."
"YNAB is about budgets.  First and foremost.  So at the end of a month you sit down for 15 minutes and see how much money do I have available for the upcoming month?  It shows you your current balance + any money you earned in the current month but assigned a category of \"Income available next month\".  As you assign your money to to various budget categories it deducts it from your available amount.\n\nOnce you've budgeted, as you spend money, it deducts it from the budget category.  So if I budgeted $100 for restaurant spending and I go to Wendy's and and spend $8 it will show me I have $92 left that I'm allowed to use for restaurants.\n\nBalancing a checkbook is more like Quicken or Mint.  It lets you know how much money you have and how you spent it.  YNAB is about planning."

Pretty much the reason why I made my post.\n\nI have actually set up my own big-ass spreadsheet. It took me quite some time. So it was a bit tiresome. Having said that, I still have to do some work on it to get an actual budgeting function implemented. So far it's only a *tracker* or *overview*. So in some sense: *shit*. Still gotta work on it.

"My suggestion: Buy a couple lunches for someone trust-worthy and financially knowledgeable who will help you understand your finances and make a plan for what to do next.\n\nYou aren't going to get significant financial gains by investing $50. You will not stumble on a miraculous penny stock (or crypto-currency, just to rule that out now) that goes 100x in value in a year. Even if you did, you would be left with $5k, which still isn't an incredible sum of money.\n\nThe question conveys that you don't have a great understanding of the value of $50 or personal finance concepts. I don't say that judgingly. Trying to do something positive and longer-term with your money puts you ahead of the vast majority of people. You're the person at the gym, who is always several steps ahead of the people still on the couch watching TV.\n\nWhat you need to do is find a way to use that $50 to put your finances on a good, solid track for the future. You need to go from \"how do I invest $50, once?\" to \"how do I invest $50, every month, toward my long-term goal?\"\n\nOnce you have a longer-term plan like that, it will be worth your while to invest and learn more about how to get the cash into an investment account. You're not to that point yet. That's OK, you just need to do some earlier steps before you get there."

"I get that YNAB is not for you, but just from my standpoint, I didn't really enjoy using Mint, and it didn't help me budget. I made my own spreadsheets and entered everything manually for six months (preferred it to Mint,) so YNAB made sense. Then this offer came along while I was in the free trial, so I pounced.\n\nI think I didn't like how Mint had so many categories! I don't make a distinction in my budget between coffee shops and fast food, so that didn't work for me.\n\nI am going to guess that you're just trying to provide another perspective, so people don't just jump and buy YNAB if it's not right for them, and that's cool. I just don't like the assumption that people who manually enter transactions are being duped by YNAB or something."

"I thought the same thing when I looked at YNAB vs. Mint a few years ago, and I continued using Mint. But for my purposes, I NEED something that forces me to use an envelope budgeting system. Sure, you can use Mint to budget, but so far, I'm finding this hands-on approach much better for my lifestyle. \n\nPlus, with Mint, I am constantly having to correct the categories it assigns transactions to--it guesses wrong a lot of the time, even for recurring transactions. So far, YNAB hasn't taken much more of my time. We'll see how it goes, though.\n\nNow I wish I'd waited another week to purchase YNAB...I got it for $30 last week!"
"Given how recent #2 was, I'd say it's probably not a good idea.  Have you applied for the manager job?  Perhaps saying you're interested in it is a better way to go about it."
"Mint's budget feature as others have said, is done with imaginary money.  Here is the process when I sit down to do the monthly budget in YNAB.\n\n1. Look at how much I have available to budget this month (Leftover from last month + income last month I assigned as category \"Income available next month\")\n2. Being assigning budget amounts to categories. ($750 for rent, $80 for Intenet, $75 for cellphone)\n3. As I'm assigning those my \"available left to budget drops accordingly\"\n4. Continue assigning categories until everything is assigned.\n\nNow throughout the month when I spend money, instead of telling me \"You have $x left in your account\" YNAB focuses on \"You have $x left in the budget category you just entered\"\n\nAlso it helps with larger expenditures.  For example I plan on buying an Atom 1U server in the next few months.  This will set me back $600.  I have a category for computer hardware and have assigned $150 to that category for the last few months.  Also great for things like car insurance that you pay every 6 months or Christmas gift budgeting (budget $25/mo for Christmas gifts and at the end of the year YNAB shows you now have $300 available to spend for Christmas gifts).\n\nAside from reconsiling my bank account with YNAB I don't pay attention to my balance anymore, I go off what YNAB shows me I have available in my budget.  If it's not available in my budget I can either assign any currently unbudgeted dollars to it or budget it for a future month.\n\nThat said, this can all be done with a spreadsheet.  They even say as much on their website, it's more about the process than it is about the program.  The program is good at following the process though and at $15 that is more than worth my time creating a spreadsheet to do the same thing, especially after factoring in things like the mobile app."
"My credit union does it automatically and it's rarely accurate.\n\nI go to BevMo and spend $50, it gets categorized as \"groceries\".  No, fool, that's a bottle of scotch, purely recreational, not important to my life at all.\n\nI go to the mom and pop grocer for staple items, and it gets categorized as \"miscellaneous\".\n\nI go get a new hard drive for my computer which I need for my job, it gets categorized as electronics and entertainment.\n\nI spent just as much time correcting their auto-categorization as I would have entering it myself, and with limited mobile features (they're not selling software, they're selling banking), the interface was never optimized.\n\nPlus, as others have said, entering it yourself helps you realize exactly what you're doing.  It's pretty easy to see something on a store shelf, bring it to the cashier, swipe your card, and go aboout your day without ever pausing to think about the individual purchase you just made.\n\n\nI'm a programmer by trade, and I can't think of an easy way for software to look at a dollar amount, time, date, and merchant name, then accurately categorize frivolous versus important spending.  Places like BestBuy, eBay, car parts stores, etc all sell things that can be considered either important or frivolous depending on the particular person in question"
"The short answer is call a company that handles IRAs, tell them you want to open an IRA, and make them do the work. If you pick a big name financial institution and ask at every step of the way \"what are the fees/costs?\" it's hard to go too far wrong. Generally, when you are trying to give a financial institution money, the process goes smoothly and they'll help answer all your questions. :) \n\nLean on their customer service and ask lots of questions. For example, if they need your account information so you can transfer money from your main bank, and you don't know where to get that, ask the person on the phone where you can get it. Start the phone call by saying that this is your first investment account and that your goal is to keep fees and costs as absolutely low as possible.\n\nEveryone recommends working with Vanguard, and that seems a safe bet. You might also consider your current financial institution's investment arm. I personally bank with Bank of America, and it was pretty easy for me to set up a roth IRA with Merrill Lynch, which they own, and keep all the accounts connected. "
"Yeah you can use that it's not very different from the ones I suggested I just don't like the interface I guess. \n\nThe information stuff they send you with the opening is not that bad, but it doesn't really help you with the choice you have to make. The trackers are usually ETFs. But there are also other financial products who \"track\" the DAX but I would not recommend them for you right now. Just check that it's a ETF. \n\nhttp://www.finanzen.net/\n\nHere you can look for stuff to buy and there's also a lot of information. "
"Not sure why you were downvoted for stating your opinion. \n\nI appreciate OP for alerting us to a great deal, but having a budget isn't the only way to manage your finances.

"Most of the time, DCA hurts more than it helps.\n\nEdit: grammar"
"I really don't understand why you keep saying that Mint isn't using your actual money. You do set up your budgets with the expectation that you'll make a certain amount of money in the future, and that's \"how much money you think you'll have\", but nothing can see forward in time to how much you'll actually have.\n\nMint doesn't push you toward a monthly maximum either. If I budget $60 for entertainment each month (and I do), it's up to me if I spend all of that or not. I usually spend less than that, and if I go over, Mint will notify me, and I use self-control to avoid spending more.\n\nIt all depends on whether you want to actively work with your budget or not. You can just sit back and watch the numbers add up, or you can watch where your money is going and react accordingly.\n\nAnd I should point out, I'm not trying to say that YNAB is bad. It seems fine, and it obviously works for some people. People who like to manually add every single purchase they make into a database. ;)"

Go over it a few times before you talk to your boss.\n\nYou probably should just ask though. Sounds like there would be cause enough.  The trouble with the key shouldn't be an issue anymore and worst case scenario would realistically be \"no, you can't have more money\" not \"no, and you are fired for asking\" anyway. And if you are thinking of leaving, even more so. If you don't get more money, start job hunting quietly.\n\nYou could also consider asking for a promotion rather than pay rise. \"I want to be given the managers position.

"&gt; You do set up your budgets with the expectation that you'll make a certain amount of money in the future, and that's \"how much money you think you'll have\", but nothing can see forward in time to how much you'll actually have.\n\nYou don't, actually, in YNAB. That's the whole point. You're only budgeting with money you have. In YNAB, you can't budget $60 to Entertainment if you don't have $60 in your account.\n\n&gt; It all depends on whether you want to actively work with your budget or not. You can just sit back and watch the numbers add up, or you can watch where your money is going and react accordingly.\n\nYou could also make an argument that actively working with your budget is more helpful to people living paycheck-to-paycheck than people who aren't.

I used Mint for a long time, it didn't help me personally. I've used YNAB for a couple months, it's helped me immensely. It's absolutely different strokes for different folks. \n\nI also feel like people in this thread are way overplaying how much effort it takes to add every single purchase. It takes very, very little effort to be honest. Maybe 10 seconds per card swipe. That's another benefit the software has, it streamlines the data entry portion. That's the major benefit it has over a basic Excel solution. Say I get a tank of gas. While the tank's filling, I pull out my phone, hit add a transaction. The gas station's already saved as one of my locations, so it autofills the account, and the category. I just put in the amount I spend, hit done, and pocket my phone. It syncs back so when I get home I can load YNAB and it's already there.\n\nYeah, it's more effort. But it's also more control, and it keeps you more involved."

"I know what you mean. When I talk about YNAB, I'm fully aware that I sound like a salesperson or a fanatic. But... it really did help change the way I look at my money. I actually did go from being a few thousand in debt to being on top of all my bills and having almost $2000 in savings. \n\nI used Mint, and having it all automated made it too much of a post-mortem thing. \"This is where your money went\" instead of \"this is where your money is going.\" It got to the point where I let it kind of run by itself in the background, which didn't do me any good. Also, the budgeting was kind of weak. If you went over in some category, there was no sense of that money having to come from another budget category. It was just \"well, you're over.\" It just didn't work for me. Also, the categorization was wonky. \"Tom Thumb\" can be groceries, household stuff, cat food/litter, or gas. If I have to fix all of that in Mint anyways, it's glorious automatic pulling from my bank isn't really that much better than just entering transactions from my phone as I make them, or entering off of receipts later. So, overall, Mint just doesn't work *for me*. \n\nAs for my spreadsheet, it was... adequate. Sort of. It allowed for some planning, but I didn't really have it set up to log transactions, or to track history or anything. I didn't really know much about budgeting when I made it. Knowing what I know now, could I build a spreadsheet of simulate what YNAB does? Absolutely. Excel is awesome. But why reinvent the wheel when I've got an awesome one right here? Plus, YNAB is pretty specifically designed to work with a fiscally conservative philosophy. It's already set up and ready for use, and it's very well thought-out. \n\nYNAB does have historical tracking. The reports are pretty nifty, actually. You can drill down by category, or see overviews, or look at your net worth over time, or whatever. You can look at a given category's trend over any given period of time, look at your income vs. expenditures... I don't think Mint had anything there that YNAB doesn't have, but of course it's been a long time since I've used Mint, so I could be mistaken. You can also export all of these different reports into Excel if you want to look at them a different way. That's how I made [this](http://imgur.com/0VD7lYJ) to look at my 2013 averages and set goals for 2014. \n\nI mean, if you absolutely love Mint, then more power to you. If it works for you, great! It didn't work for me, and it doesn't work for everyone. YNAB works for me, and it also works for a lot of other people. For me, it was worth the $60 investment. The manual entries make me be more aware of what I'm spending (that was a BIG problem for me in the past), the budgeting helps me plan the future better, and the reports are fantastic for seeing where I've come from and how I'm doing. It's different from Mint, but different people need different things. Different != inferior."

If they die before going bankrupt, will we be asked to pick up the burden, or will it be passed on the kids?\n\nWe don't live in the 1800's Europe, so no.\n\n&gt; if any of you have lived through a similar situation with in-laws/siblings, is there any advice you can give?\n\nIt's not my problem. Besides mentioning it to them once, I don't care. Don't lend them money. If you want to help out your niece/nephew, set up a trust fund for them"
"&gt; should formerly apply\n\nI can't tell if this is a common use for the term in the US because I've seen it used this way a couple of times but isn't it supposed to be \"formally apply\"?"
"OP is just acting manager, not acting regional manager. But yes, best way to convince senior management would be to continue performing beyond expectations and then formally applying for the position. "
"What date does the Costco card say on it 2006? Amex backdates their cards. If there is no fee just leave it open."
"Startups with no competition are usually too good to be true. It either means you haven't looked hard enough, or your idea isn't good, or your idea is ahead of its time. Generally professional investors are skeptical of anything with \"no competition\"."

"They're looking for someone with more experience when clearly you are capable of doing the job. If you find it too stressful and you feel that you aren't likely to receive any additional compensation for this extra work, start looking for a new job. If you want to stick with this company, sit your bosses down and let them know, you are dedicated to the company and willing to do the work, but you have to be paid for the job you are doing, which is the manager's job, not the assistant manager.

"I'm in Germany (work for a US company and paid in dollars) and use the following combination:\n\n\nCapital One Venture Rewards (Visa) - No Chip, but accepted most places here with no issues.  No foreign fee, but ~$65 annual fee.  2% rewards when used for travel expenses, 1% otherwise.  No Cap One cards have a foreign fee, so there are other options with no annual fee.\n\n\nUSAA MasterCard - Meets all of your criteria except for a 1% foreign fee.  1% rewards.  Need to specifically request an EMV card when opening the account.  Use this one when I happen to need an EMV card.  Also handy because I do all of my banking at USAA as well.\n\n\nNever had any problems using one or both of these in my European travels."
"Usually a car has a 3 year warranty, so if you lease a car for 3 years, it will be under warranty for the entire duration of the lease. So if there is a mechanical issue with the car, the dealership will take care of the entire cost of the repair, and they will usually give you a loaner car for free while the car is in the shop so you can still get around.\n\nIf you do back to back 3 year leases, you will always be driving a car that is under warranty."

"Yup. The synching happens through Dropbox, and even if you're both entering transactions at the same time, it will all sync almost instantly. The way they did that was pretty slick. (The previous method was cumbersome and a bit fiddly.)"
"True, but then you might be missing  the point. If you only do it every couple of weeks, you don't have real-time standings for your budget and how much you have to spend. As others pointed out, it takes about 15 seconds to enter a transaction for frequently visited merchants (like the grocery store, etc) because YNAB learns your location. "
"It will not hurt your credit history at all.  What it will do is lower your current FICO score by a few points, temporarily.  Your FICO score is already high enough that should you apply for credit/loan you would be considered in the top tier and qualify for the best rates.  So close the card if it makes you feel better (I would).  The impact will be minimal and temporary."

"An UGMA or UTMA account might do the trick. That kind of account puts the assets in the child's name but leaves the control over it in your hands. You would still be able to make withdrawals, though (but it would be a breach of fiduciary duty to make withdrawals for yourself). "

"For 2014, phase-out begins at 65k and ends at 80k."
"&gt; I really don't understand why you keep saying that Mint isn't using your actual money. You do set up your budgets with the expectation that you'll make a certain amount of money in the future, and that's \"how much money you think you'll have\", but nothing can see forward in time to how much you'll actually have.\n\nAh, but that's the thing. With YNAB, you're actively encouraged to use a paycheck for *next* month, rather than this one. For most people, after a couple of months they get to the point where January paychecks are used for February's budget, etc. Then your budget **is** using actual money, and there's no \"expectation\" at all, only reality. Not sure whether mint has the same possibility, but for sure if it does it's not the intuitive/default setting, so most people don't use it that way. "
"Congratulations! I am excited for you.  You are well on your way to building some wealth with the loans off your back.  \n\nIf I were you, and I practically am (public employee, 29) I would focus on investing in yourself.  It sounds like you have some big plans and a direction with your career.  That is awesome.   So you want to make sound financial decisions in order to achieve your career goals.\n\n\nI think the best thing you can do at our age is to study personal finance.  Get a subscription to kiplinger's, smart money, things like that. That knowledge will pay dividends for the rest of your life.  That does not mean you become a blind follower of their philosophy, or any guru's philosophy for that matter.\n\n\nThe second thing is transportation.  You don't mention a car payment.   Paid for?  Old beater?   If so, great.  People our age have typically already pissed away income on depreciation and insurance costs for 10 years.\n\nPut all your spare money into savings.  Honestly, what's the downside of that?  You already mention you may go to grad school and/or will work summer jobs.  Start building up savings now.\n\nOn top of that, make sure these summer jobs will really be beneficial for your career objectives.  Otherwise they are a waste of time.\n\nGood job!"

"I am willing the transportation expenses game. 90% of my transportation is done via cycling. My car that I begrudging own (I am anticar) is a 92 civic I bought used for 2k and put about 600 into it and some grease monkeying know how and it runs smooth. So far I've gotten six months out of it and I think I'll have no problems getting more than four out of it.\n\nMy insurance is 300 annually, due to my lack of driving.\n\nMy goal for the car is by the time it dies, I should have these options:  \n* Not have to buy another car since I am living in a city where I can get by on my bicycle  \n* Or just buy another 1.5 engine and drop it in. It's pretty cheap, really.\n\nThe summer jobs wont be the MOST beneficial. Let's just say there are a lot better things I could be doing. They are in forestry and fire for our national parks. I am not doing them for money or career. It is mainly because I feel obligated to, I want to give my time to the land. I am in the Geo Spatial field, but having some forestry background doesn't really help it."

"From my point of view, the main advantage is the free app for your phone that you'd use hand-in-hand with the full YNAB software, to enter in transactions on the go. If you don't have a phone or wouldn't use it, then there's not much more that YNAB does over excel, other than look pretty. The philosophy is the critical piece, and you can get that without the software. I'm a huge YNAB fan, but the life changing part is the *training* and *philosophy*, not the software. Once you know what you're doing, you can do it easily with other tools. "

"Solid.  I have a 98 civic myself, paid cash, 202000 miles now and going strong.  Still seems a little high.

"Yes, the tax situation for US expats does get tricky.  401k contributions will not be a problem, but if your income is not high enough you may lose eligibility for IRA contributions due to the foreign earned income exclusion.

"If it helps you save what you spend or more, then it is worth it, no?"
"Mint does this, but that isn't the point of YNAB.  Take control and monitor your own spending better, it will ultimately help you save a lot more money. "
"Congrats on your resolution.  There is little else that will improve your quality of life as much as being financially savvy and secure.\n\nTo put things in perspective, when I was in college, my online savings earned 5%.  .85 is brutal, however that's the market right now.  It makes sense to make your capital work as hard as it can for you, but with these rates, cutting your expenses is more important than any measly interest earnings from the savings account, unless you are talking massive account balances.\n\nIn addition, check your bank for foreign transaction fees.  I switched banks before I studied abroad in Scotland because my bank was going to charge me a fee every time I used the debit card overseas.  I found one with no foreign transaction fee before I left."
"The budget tab is for planning ahead. "
"Anyone else have trouble buying this?"
"Yes. My fiancé is very good with money (actually better than me considering I constantly study personal finance from reading books to using tools, and she just in her words \"is just a big saver and frugal shopper\"). We don't want to preach to them. That's not polite, it's not fair to us or them. We just don't want to take on their burden, and want to be prepared in case we have to."
"Ugh typo.  Yes, I meant formally.  Formerly implies past tense, my mistake."
"I also worked a co-op when I was 22. I made closer to $50K over the course of one year. I lived rather extravagantly that year, bought new clothes, spent $4,500 on a car, went to lots of bars and restaurants. I did save enough to fund a 6-week trip to europe with my buddy that took place the following summer. I was pretty broke after that and went back to college which was funded by my parents.\n\nThat co-op and other research experience gave me a big edge when looking for interesting and relatively high paying jobs after college. I haven't struggled with money much since and I have managed to save plenty.\n\nThe travel experience is something that I'll never forget and solidified my friendship with my buddy. I just asked him to be my best man in my upcoming wedding.\n\nIn short, I spent it all, most of it on *experiences*, and I don't regret it a bit.\n\nGood luck!"
"Yeah I am. Cant do it via steam or the website..."
"The average amount of money from a cash-out is ~$30,000.  Down payment in a lot of places in the US, but certainly not somewhere like the San Francisco Bay Area (or even Boston/Cambridge, where $30K isn't enough down to avoid PMI for anything nice in the city itself).\n\nEven if you cashed out to the tune of $100,000, how long it took to get it and the salary you gave up is also for consideration.  For the record, I've \"played the startup game\" several times, and learned that I was always going to be better off working for myself (where I'm not looking for \"an exit\").\n\nAs others have mentioned, \"learning how its done\" is worthwhile, but I honestly got the most of that knowledge at a small business (wholesaler) that wasn't a startup.  If you put in the effort to do your homework, you can get that exposure and knowledge without taking a haircut in salary negotiations."

"Well student loan interest may be deductible and these are tax advantaged retirement accounts.  It's a bit more complicated than just taking out a loan at 8%."
"It depends on the card - some do that and some don't. A quick google search shows that card probably does have that feature (\"statement credit\"). If you have an online account you should be able to check this - just look for a redemption option that sounds like a statement credit or \"pay with points\" type link."

"Treat savings as if it was rent payment. Right as you get the money send it to a savings account; ideally one where it's not easy to get the money out quickly."
"Well that depends. What vision do you have for growth and promotion in the future? Suppose you take his 50k. You, as the owner, would have to play out all possible scenarios both financially and growth-wise before making a decision. Look at where the money would go and what it will turn into in 1, 2, 3, 5 years. Then weigh those options against what he hopes for in terms of return, and work something out."
