"you can start visualizing a few things\n\n* what is the average growth rate of your income in the industry\n* what are your values in life and how much you would spend on them\n\n40 years old is 18 years away. the formula to becoming wealthy is very simple. [Spend less, earn more and build wealth wisely](http://www.investmentmoats.com/wealth-building-2/my-best-friend-asked-me-how-to-become-wealthy-this-is-what-i-told-him/). \n\nGoing by what i written in there, it is likely you have started early. Decide on how much you would like to contribute. By this i mean boxing out a portion of that 50k initially to funnel into wealth building (you are not gonna touch this portion so think of sizing it well)\n\nThen think about funneling a % of your future increment to add on to it.\n\nThere are folks who go into semi retirement in 40s based on a salary of 50k. They just save like 80% of their income intially. \n\nTo find out whether its better to save your increments more or start with more you can [use a wealthy calculator here](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1u3emo/a_free_google_spreadsheet_wealth_calculator/).\n\nTo start off Vanguard low cost ETF is a viable option.If you want minimal management, perhaps a Vanguard Total World Stock Market ETF (VT) and a US Bond ETF will suffice.\n\nThey are low cost (cost compounds in the long run) options, and have proven result to be positive in rolling 20 year period.\n\nWhat matters most to building wealth? you realize the main 2 are currently within your control: starting early and contributing more.\n\nBoost them by applying the other 6 factors i highlight in the middle of the article.\n\nGo on, play with the wealthy calculator. It will give you a direction to focus on. A monthly automatic funnel, a yearly target that you can realistically aim for, and visualizing a sizeable 10 year target."
"I'm 23, have no debt, no car payments, no gf, live at home, and make 52k/year (plus bonuses throughout the year than can push it up 20-30k more).\n\nAt 19, I started a Roth IRA. I was putting about $100-150/mo until this past August when I started maxing it out.\n\nI automatically put a set amount per check into my Savings account.\n\nI give myself a spending budget where I can do anything I want with it, which is $750 per month. The rest (minus Roth IRA) goes to Savings.\n\nI have four credit cards, one that only pays for Netflix, one that only pays for a couple yearly subscriptions (like 6 or so transactions a year), and two other credit cards that are cash-back/travel. All four credit cards are on Auto-Pay so I don't worry about missing a payment.\n\nMy company doesn't have a 401k yet but they will sometime next year and I plan on putting in what they will match before considering putting in more.\n\nMy plan right now though is to move out of my parents' early next year, which will be a $700-900/mo expense. Then on top of that are things my parents used to pay for that they won't anymore, like the cell phone, Sunday lunches, a lot of food, and other small things. All in all I expect the move to affect my finances by at least $1000/month. But good news: I'm prepared. I have the basics down, and everything is in place."

Thank you, market.\n\nI used to get mad at smug talking heads dismissing the gold bugs, and I did really well with gold on the way up.   \n\nThe problem is, once the world stopped being scared of collapse and realized the economies of the world were in fact going to muddle through, the gold boom was over.   Maybe it'll come back if the world gets shook up again, I don't know.  Meanwhile, huge lessons learned; don't back up the truck, don't confuse a shitty economy with a shitty dollar or stock market, and take your loss early.  "

"I'm going to go against the grain and tell you to stay out of any IRA or 401K.\n\nThe biggest benefit for a retirement specific account like that is the employer match. You don't have that. Any funds you put in can't be withdrawn until retirement age without penalty. Also with the Roth the contributions won't lower you adjusted gross income when it comes to your yearly income taxes. You really need to read up and fully understand these types of plans. I don't like them at all simply because I don't know what the future holds and whether or not I may need that money in the future for something.\n\nI'd open a tdameritrade account and look at the commission free ETFs to start out.  You can buy most of the vanguard funds through them no fee as long as you don't sell within a month. This gets you saving and leaves the funds available for your future purchases. At 22 you're probably going to want to buy a house, get married, kids, etc... By investing outside of any specialized savings plan you'll be able to withdraw what you need for down payments, engagement rings, weddings and all the other things life throws at you. "
"There is often advice that is different than what I would give that is still quite good. Just because I think YOUR advice is bad doesn't mean I think all advice different than mine is. \n\nThere is usually logic AND ridicule when people respond to your bad advice, but after a while people just recognize you as someone who gives bad advice and don't put as much effort into refuting it because you've already been downvoted anyway. \n\nI know a guy who lives in a bunker and has 3 years of rations, a stash of guns, and a pile of gold. He tells people to prepare for doomsday and he LIVES by that advice. That doesn't mean it's not stupid and bad advice. \n"

"&gt;like to use their refund\n\nAnother tip from someone who has accumulated a bit of scratch - use the IRS tax estimator tool online and *don't* get a refund. \n\nYour goal each year should be to go zeroes with the IRS on tax day.

"Well done and written.\n\nI would contend that your first statement, \"Multiples are everything,\" should be reworked.  I.e. if the industry average is, for whatever reason, 8x, and the company is trading at 16x, you'd view that as a positive, where it's actually quite a negative knock.  As we're trying to beat the market, the market itself should be included in each step of the analysis and our equity of choice analyzed against it."

"I'm late to the party but here's my two-bits,\n\nWork on a plan for where you're going in terms of how you're going to need in order to meet your financial goals.\n\nThere are lots of good, free, on line tools. I like this one:\n\nhttp://www.marketwatch.com/retirement/tools/retirement-planning-calculator\n\nI agree that maxing out your Roth is a great move. I think that you can afford to be aggressive with what you invest in because at this point, if you mess up, you can increase your savings rate and rebuild your savings pretty quickly.\n\nYou probably already know this, but you have a huge advantage over most folks. You're starting much earlier than typical and it sounds like you're willing to put a lot of savings to work. That's prefect.\n\nMany people start too late relative to their needs/goals. You can think of this in terms of compound interest. Roughly, the Rule of 72 works. For example, 12% interest, compounded over 6 years, will double your investment's value. Or 10% for 7 years, or 8% for 9 years, ...\n\nLet's say you're earning a constant 12% per year on an investment. So it doubles in 6 years, and so on.\n\nIf you start with $10,000 and it grew for 40 years at 12% interest:\n\nNow:   10,000\n6-year:  20,000\n12-years:  40,000\n18-year: 80,000\n24-years: 160,000\n30-years: 320,000\n36-years: 640,000\n42-years: 1,280,000\n\nThe first time you double your investments, you're happy but you're way short of retiring.\n\nThe really big changes in your net worth happen in the last few years. Doubling $10,000 isn't nearly as interesting as doubling $640,000.\n\nPeople who start 'too late' don't get those last couple of big doublings."

"at your age and salary neither investing nor salary is important. You need to be focused on growing your income. By the time you are in your 30s, you want to be earning 3 to 4 times that. Thats what will hp you to build wealth. What you need to be focused on is on making the choices, relationships and strategies that will help you grow professionally. There are two ways to get there, by salary or by entrepreneurship. grind and handshake your way up the ladder, or work towards building a business that you can sell for a big payday (and then repeat). Either way, your income and savings in your twenties is generally irrelevant compared with what you should become your earning power and money you can invest starting in your thirties.

"I'm an analyst at a hedge fund, so I have a pretty good idea how much research it takes to be able to be confident enough with an investment that it makes sense to buy. The consensus among people that I've talked to and interviews that I've read, as well as my own experience, is that it takes about a month worth of full time (40+ hours a week) of research, and that's for trained professionals. \n\nBe totally honest here, how much research did you do on these companies?

"ETFs of uncorrelated asset classes you'd want to look into:\n\n* Stocks (US, international, emerging) - VTI, VXUS, and VWO\n* Bonds - BND\n* REITs - VNQ\n\nIf you're trying for higher returns and risk, I'd recommend something around 80/20 stocks/bonds. Maybe 35% VTI, 30% VXUS, 5% VWO, 20% BND, 10% VNQ. There's real no need for REITs or emerging markets if transaction costs for your broker are an issue (and they might be if you're investing only 40k). Consider opening an account at Vanguard and investing directly into the mutual funds these ETFs represent.\n\nDon't forget to rebalance every year or so. \n\nThese are all Vanguard funds, you might want to look into alternates with lower expense ratios if you can find any. Beware of taxes on REITs and bonds (they're considered taxable income, *not* capital gains or dividends in some places) and keep them in tax-advantaged accounts if possible, or look for funds that offer municipal bonds you have to pay less taxes on. \n\n"

If setup as a partnership you would still face the complication of year-end tax allocations and tax slip preparation.

"Ugggh.....As a Certified Financial Planner, where do I begin?\n\n1. Wealthy people/clients do not seek forum boards. Wealthy seek wealthy people. Copy the habits, patterns and behaviors of wealthy people. \n\n2. Saving may make one comfortable; Saving will not make one wealthy (Unless you have a very high-income earning occupation). \n\n3. Wealth comes from within. Increase/improve your skills and abilities. 50k is now sufficient; it will not suffice if you have a pet, gf/wife, child, gf/wife/child, home, or all of the above, in any part of the United States. \n\n4. Maximizing retirement accounts is the *bare minimum* to preserve your standard of living and it is a blind means to providing oneself with a pension. It is not a means to wealth. Why? Because Mitt Romney used tax loopholes to accumulate Fantastic wealth, while average americans Use the same loopholes to accumulate barely liveable retirement funds. (He used the 401(k)/DC programs to stuff Bain funds that would grow 100x to park deferred income on a tax favored basis in substantial means; last time this was seen was utilizing Option contracts during the tech bubble and MSFT stock). \n\n5. Learn financial skills:\n- create a business.\n- invest in real estate.\n- passive income (business, programming, etC)\n- trading, stock speculation.\n- advanced degrees for increased income. \n\nThe best you may hope is low-cost index funds with large savings plans, where at best you may 'retire' on a very meager income in your 40's, perhaps 50's, and at that point you will be hoping you do not live too long or spend too much."

It's a hassle but this will keep you an investment club instead of a fund.\n\nIf you daytrade and make a lot of trades per day, set up a daily vote with the strategy for the day. Something like \"Looking at XYZ stock and planning to trade on the spread for the day. Stop loss at this percentage, etc...\" Ask them to reply with a yes.\n\nIf they are busy/don't have time, they can just reply a \"Yes\" without reading.

"Definitely agree. \n\nFuture growth can mean a lot as well. I don't care if I'm paying 50x EBITDA if EBITDA will triple for the next few years for some reason. \n\nSo from my point of view the OP is a great detailed post but it is not complete by a long shot. It's not that simple. Pre defined ranges is a recipe for error. VIC is half crap. I don't think any amount of books are going to replace actual experience. \n\nI know personally meeting and talking with mgmt, other investors big and small about specific companies and investment thesis' has taught me a ton. Things I would never learn in a book. It is also a lot harder to put together all the pieces from a book or VIC post vs. your money on the line and doing all the research yourself and understanding the what and why. \n\nBut to each their own. "
"I would disagree and suggest caution with that line of thinking. \nNormal traders and normal investors are entirely different entities that should theoretically purchase and sell stock for entirely different reasons. Investors should be thought of as informed and uninformed. An informed can be a large or small investor just the same as an uninformed can be. We would certainly hope for the large investor to be informed but it does not always happen that way. \n\nAny investor, small or large, can and should do in-depth research. Even if they are not risking a large amount of money it is the main way you will learn. Whether you end up being right or wrong you can learn why and adjust and improve this for your next investment. \n\n"

"Don't listen to what these guys are saying! Share price is everything!

"Good write up but it's largely all wrong to base investments using accounting based earnings as a basis. Also free cash flow metrics can dissuade you from buying companies that are investing. Like Amazon.  You need to research Economic Value Added (EVA) which is like a return on capital but rather than divide by capital it treats cost of capital as a cost and subtracts it. So you can rationally analyze companies that don't use a lot of capital. Like Apple and many internet companies.  If EVA is high and going up then that's all you need to know.  "

"Thanks, and i somewhat disagree. Entire sectors can be beaten down really. You saw that with retail. I think there were more retail opportunities like this, and average multiples were probably too low. \n\nSame with oil companies, they might all beat the market on average in a few years, because who really knows where oil prices will go? The consensus is down on the short term. But I would say that is driven by emotion alot.\n\nAnd if the market gives some sector an average of 17 times earnings, that might not make sense. Maybe in 2008 that was 7 times earnings? You should look at what makes sense imo."
"I didn't have much in my trading account ($6-8,000), but I'm up 200% or so ($18-21,000). I've lost a quarter more (was up 300%) from greed. I think my luck has run out, though. I'm preparing for a more mature trading year. (Please don't look at my mathing.)\n\nMy 401k (buy and hold) hasn't been as good. I had INTC, CAT, and CVX for the majority of the year. I'd say I'm pretty stagnant there."
"Nah, that was my point, if you are a value guy, you cannot pay 50x ebitda. Which is probably 70-80 times earnings. If they triple earnings in next 2 years, then at current price that would be 20 times earnings. And then who says they will keep doing that? Paying 20 times earnings and then beating the market would imply they then keep growing with double digits for another 5-10 year. And you will only beat the market by a pretty small margin, ONLY if there is insane growth that they can capitalize on for the most part. \n\nHow many companies do you know where you can be reasonably sure that would happen? They would need an insane moat.\n\nMy point is simply wait for the fat pitches where the price really doesnt make sense. Or where you can buy that growth story for 10-12 times earnings. If they only grow slowly, or grow barely at all, you wont lose money. But if they 'only' grow 20% a year and you paid 50x ebitda for it, you will lose money. \n\nAnd I disagree about not learning alot from reading alot. I also read the latest quarterly calls (they can be v interesting). You see what kind of questions management answers, if they are honest, and sometimes go into the nitty gritty of daily operations. You also see what kind of questions the analysts ask. If they are relevant or not. Talking with management can cause you to be biased, so I wouldnt rely too much on that anyway."

I was making a point that when a company generated that much cash in the last 3 years alone as its market cap, you should take a look under the hood and see if the market's point of view is reasonable. \n\nWould love to hear what I left out here? I wanted to go more into where the profit comes from (how they sell gadgets next to the electronics), but that would be another page or so. Just wanted to make a point that you dont need to know that much when a company is trading those super depressed levels. If it was trading at 9-10x earnings, you would need to be alot more sure about your case."
"They are wrong, it always matters in the long run. Lets say a company has no debt. It trades at 4 times free cash flow. It would pay out a 25% dividend here. THat would only need to happen for 4 years before you break even (conveniently ignoring tax here lol)! After that it is free money. The market generally flocks to these type of companies. Unless the money comes from liquidating or something. Generally it will go down to 5-10% dividends. That would imply well over a 100% upside, probably in the short term. As soon as it shows up on the screeners of dividend guys."

"Archars, what did you do that got you a 200 return for the year? "
"yeah I editted some things. When I described those multiples I assumed fair value by the market, but that wasnt super clear from reading it back. \n\nIt is also a quick way to see if something is cheap or not. Like if you see a growth story with alot of potential for 10 times earnings its cheap, but I wouldnt touch it at 50 times earnings.But if you see a company making machines in some niche area with v little growth with mediocre return on capital, it is probably fairly valued at 10x.  I dont think you will miss out on alot of multibaggers by ignoring stocks that trade at 50 times earnings. Unless ofcourse somehow margins will greatly improve. \nAnd I tried to make the point that if you see something for under 10 times earnings, you should always look into it. But to always be carefull to predict where they will be in 10 years if there is not much growth. Or to be carefull to pay 50x for it, just because it grew 20-30% this year. And alot less needs to go wrong when it is trading in the single digits as well. \n\nAnd the title is to lure people in :P .

She wanted to take a trip, I calculated exactly how much we'd have to save each month to be able to do it and then that would become a wet blanket over other things because I wanted us to save for a house and be able to be single income parents... We got the house, but she left because she just wasn't really happy, I think I wasn't exciting enough and was too worried about the details of life and money.\n\nI've spent the past 2 years trying to discover who I am, and I'm realizing that I'm just a boring person... the only interesting things I've done have been with my ex's... \n\nI am 34 now, and I refuse to wake up one day after my 40th birthday and realize that I spent what are arguably the best two decades of my life worrying about money and avoiding fun because of the cost.\n\nThe whole purpose of earning a living is to live.  Sometimes people are in a circumstance where their lives are boring or limited out of necessity, and that's fine... but if you have the option, get out there and do things!\n\n**EDIT** This advice is intended to give someone pause and to consider the ramifications of being too focused on \"retirement\", especially when they're still in their 20s.  It wasn't really meant to be all that inspirational, and certainly wasn't meant to deter someone from making good financial decisions or saving for retirement at an early age--it was more about my own regret at not taking advantage of certain aspects of my life in order to save money (i.e. allowing money to always be the deciding factor).  Often I'll read things here on Reddit that give me a reason to stop and consider what my own feelings would be if I found myself there, that's what this was.  Best of luck to all, and thanks for the attention"
"Good job!! How did you know where to research for specific stocks?"
"Thank you for outlining this for us."

"Some books, some advisers, you'll get there.  Good luck!\n\nI personally would be worried about simply dumping into an index right now because I feel things are high--but I thought that same thing back in May when I dumped many thousands into an S&amp;P index fund and that is up 12%... if I had parked it in cash I'd be up maybe 0.25% right now, if that... perhaps by this May I'll be at -12%, it's a risk, but given time and a stable(ish) US government/dollar the market will rise, you just have to have patience and the fortitude to watch things go down sometimes."
"The idea of buying on margin terrifies me. You're either crazy stupid, or got the biggest set of balls. Hopefully cashed out and are putting your gains into growing things that are less likely to bite you. Continued good luck to you in 2014."
"Up 47.82%...  that's a personal, Roth, and traditional IRA."
"yeah I editted that in at the end. I think I also explained clearly that just looking at earnings is very limiting right?"
"Please, OP, can you answer this question? And thank you for your research and sharing btw."
"I just figured this out last night. My IRA was up 30.5%, so I basically slightly beat the market. I had a few equities that I rode this year (BAC, FB, F), but in the 4th quarter I basically dumped out of all of my individual equities and redistributed across a series of index funds (home builders, biotech, IT services, and a general market fund). \n\nI'm much more conservative that a lot of you guys in this sub, and I think that 2013 was a hard year to make many mistakes. Interested to see if 2014 is as forgiving."
"The answer to your question could be radically different depending on what you mean by a \"fund\", who your investors are, how many of them there are and a host of other factors.  What exactly are you contemplating?"
"17% overall.  32% on the portion of the portfolio that's properly benchmarked against the S&amp;P500."
"I beat 29.6%. I'm telling the truth. My portfolio is FBIOX, FSCRX, FSCHX, and IWM. More than 50% weight in FSCRX."

"Even the greatest investment bankers and fund managers in the world only beat the market about half of the time. Even in the recession, the global GDP increased about 4%. So why not just be the market? Diversify, hedge bets and decrease risk as much as possible by gaining exposure to as much as possible... Get rich slowly."
"Precious metals... Bought them last year. Silver around 28 bucks an ounce and gold at around 1600.. Yeah lost around a third of my money. (I'm young and new to this sub so if anyone could help me from here on that'd be great.)"
"yeah I would only do what I do if you have alot of savings you can invest and you would enjoy the process of digging into it and finding opportunities. \n\nThe reason investment bankers and fund managers often underperform, is because they have the wrong incentives. There is alot of politics in institutional investing, and they are often limited by very large size. Or they just plain suck. Not every professional is good at what he does, even tho he might have a degree or a title. \n\nAnother reason is that valueinvesting can underperform in bull markets, especially  if your size is large. You will be limited by a few large cap companies. You might beat the market the last 2 years, but ifyou underperform for one year in a bull market, investors might flee your fund. Even though it is purely variance."
"The fees are a killer for those of us with small cash accounts, aren't they? I've made some impulsive mistakes, and I'm still learning too. \n\nI'm currently up 1.8% on my trading account with one active position. My biggest single loss was GOGO at $107 (10.7% loss) -- part of the problem: I made the mistake of doubling down when it started to descend. I just had my biggest gain on GALE at $225 (23.7% profit)."

"Ideally you'd be pretty far away from stocks and into bonds. "
"Yes, but mostly because I have so many shares of MSFT from compensation and discounted stock purchases. All told, it was something like 40%. "
"The general rule of thumb is that gold and silver trend opposite of the stock market. So 2013 was great for stocks, terrible for gold. I would just hold onto that gold if I were you because it will always go back up, just a matter of time.  Your stocks though... Until you learn more about investing mutual funds and ETFs will likely serve you better than individual stocks."
"You should study and paper trade about 2 years before investing real money. I'd recommend staying out of individual companies and use market sectors like SPY. I know pro traders who trade nothing but e-mini's on the S&amp;P. Problem's with investing in individual companies ca be lack of volume, and they are SO easily effected by things you can NEVER know ANYTHING about until the bottom drops out. Example: when Steve Jobs was alive, those last few years, it seemed that anytime he sneezed, the stock would dip. Indexes move on news and emotion and you can read the news and (somewhat) observe the market emotion. "

"After building a strong portfolio you should consider options to preserve it after you're gone (for you future family) as an unpopular choice life insurance here is its hard to argue it's need.  More than not you'd be paying into it for the first seven years after such time the cash value accumulation would sustain the policy.  Picking up long term care (disability) is wise as well just in case you are injured and unable to work. "
"Well that's one of the things that I was hoping to learn a little about in the next few years is individual companies. I already have taken a stock market class at a college near me and for 6 hours a day, 6 days a week for 3 weeks we traded stocks on a faux portfolio. I don't feel that I was taught enough of the technical stuff to be holding the individual companies that I am. Where can I go to learn stuff like this? Are there any forums or videos that I can watch that can get me started to a point where I will know what to search for on my own?"

I've only recently figured out how to properly use stops to protect profits.  Had I known how this works earlier in the year I may have extended more profit runs and been able to sleep a little more at night!\n\nI have to say that this year has been unusual though and I took some gambles that if the markets were a bit less bullish, would not have likely played out successfully.  In all, I think I was tremendously lucky in some of the picks.  I could easily have lost a bulk of some of my gains because of the risks I was taking in 2013."

"Still classified as short term capital gains, but taxed a the same rate as income.  If the total of any income + short term gains places you in the 24% tax bracket for example, the total would be taxed at that rate.\n\nLong term gains according to the 2013 tax code (if you sold securities that you've held for over a year) are still taxed, but at a reduced rate (0%, 10%, and I think the max tax rate is 20% on significant gain in 2013)."

Be electronic but will ge be the only supplier? Will they have to throw more money in r and d? And even if you think its going to grow earning in the future, is that already priced into the stock. Also, with 2k, you gotta be careful with the jumping in and out too much. Commissions will kill you.

"Your PE thing is incorrect imo.  Just because something is 60x P/E doesn't mean that it's correctly valued or even over valued.  It most likely  means it is a growth company (one that is difficult to value).  There are a ton of companies that have very low profits or no profits because all the money is spent on growth.  In these cases, revenue, growth, margins, industry, etc. is way more important.  \n\nHonestly, I think the only way to beat the market would be to find undervalued corporations and buying them.  But there's is a problem here.  There are things that are easy to value and things that are hard to value.   Things that are extremely easy to value (I.E. T-bonds or cash) you'll almost never find these things undervalued.  Why? because if someone was trying to sell you 10 dollars for 9 dollars, you'd immediately know it is undervalued and buy it all up.  The same goes with established corporations with long track records, these companies are generally easily valued and will almost never be undervalued.  So when is the market usually wrong on things?  My guess would be on items that are difficult to value, usually high growth or distressed companies such as twitter or blackberry.  There are many disagreements on where twitter will grow to, their growth speed, the size of the market, competition, etc.  Similarly blackberry's ability to survive, change strategies, etc.  These are stocks that are difficult to value, and without saying whether they are over or under valued, these are the types of stocks that are incorrectly valued.  However, like i said, valuing these companies is no joke and would take quite a bit of skill. "

"From a regulatory standpoint being a fund manager is a bit like being a brain surgeon. There are a mile of regulations and your chance of getting through it intact as an interested amateur is very low. If any investor lost money they are virtually guaranteed to be able to recover it by finding some regulation you broke, and you would not be able to see a criminal conviction before it hit you. Don't do this unless you are extremely sure that you know what you are doing. It's quite possible that your country has some zero-regulation investment club scheme, but in that case the terms of it will be clearly set out in law and stepping anywhere else would be a minefield."

I'm sure there's plenty of sites out there that will let you build a fake portfolio without risking any real money if your sole intention is to learn.

"FWIW, I live in Seattle. It sounds like you're in great shape financially at 29, so congrats on that. There are a lot of variables that can tip the balance in one direction or another regarding buying vs. renting but for me, there's one factor that is decisive in most cases... how long you plan on living somewhere. If your work or lifestyle makes it likely that you'll move in the next five years, then the risks associated with owning are pretty high, regardless of how good the real estate market in Seattle is predicted to be. On the other hand, if it's likely you'll be putting down roots, owning protects you against a significant risk of living in a 'hot' real estate market --that of being priced out and paying increasingly higher rent which will erode the value of your earning potential as a larger and larger percentage of your salary goes to just keeping a roof over your head. In any event, it probably makes sense to rent first. There are many different neighborhoods in Seattle and you probably won't know which one will suit you best until you've lived here for a bit. Good luck!"
"I'd like to tack something on that might seem dark, but should be mentioned nonetheless. \n\nIt's possible you might die prematurely. You will have denied yourself an interesting life, and will be leaving a ton of cash that will probably be blown in a year or two."
"yeah but valueinvesting is all about pricing. \n\nAnd I said, unless they increase margins. But usually growth capital expenditures are reflected in cash flow statements, and not in the earnings statements. So if depreciation is 10 million, they might be spending 60 million in cap expenditures. So they will have positive earnings, but negative FCF. \n\nAnd if they are really set up to grow 40% a year, they would need a massive edge against competition. These companies are extremly hard to find, and even harder to assess as a private investor.. So even if you miss some of them priced this badly, you dont miss much. "

"yeah but maybe 3 years from now, someone else comes up with a disruptive technology. Or maybe the patent doesnt stand in court. Or the so called 10 billion$ market for this turns out to be only  2 billion$. etc. Lots of moving parts that can go wrong, and if only one part goes wrong theyr doomed.

"That is not what value investing is.  Definition from wikipedia, which I agree with: Although value investing has taken many forms since its inception, it generally involves buying securities that appear under priced by some form of fundamental analysis\n\nAll the risks you discussed on uncertainty applies to all companies, not just growth companies.  Without being able to see any evidence of those risks, it's not something you can put into your calculation.   Risk is inherently part of investing, and obviously you should calculate risk when valuing a company."
"I did, I mentioned that they generated 4bn$ in cash roughly in FCF in the last 3 years, and that the market cap is 4bn$. So they are trading between 2-4x cashflow. And they should deserve 7-9x cash flow, very conservatively. I'm sorry I didnt use some complicated formula, but that is usually what scares people off investing. \n\nSo if they did in the next 3 years, what they did in the last 3, you would get almost get your money back already, and the market would most likely adjust."
"The minimum is obviously zero. I think you are really asking about the largest sum that would remain legal."
"Buy a house or duplex you can afford and rent out rooms or the other apartment.

They paid my mortgage, while I invested the amount instead of spending it. \n\nNow that I have a family I sold the house and used the earnings to buy another rental property and upgrade to a bigger house for myself. "
"betting that a company will increase earnings by a factor 25x is called speculating. Value investing is buying something that is obviously cheap. It is very rare to see companies trading at 50x ebitda being undervalued. Value investing is buying something, and when you forgot a zero somewhere, you still had it for cheap. "

Nobody knows who, or which group created  Bitcon... unless you are privy to information nobody else is? \n\nFYI Hacker can simply mean someone who writes code. There is absolutely no implication they are criminals. As I have said before, who created it is irrelevant (its open source). \n\nYou shouldn't fight it... it outperformed basically everything in 2013, and could well do the same in 2014. But play safe there old man with your risk adjusted returns... I don't recommend you buying something you don't understand and spread baseless lies about anyway.\n\nIf it's still kicking ass in 2016, do you want to talk about it then or just pretend it doesn't exist?"

"I find these posts inspirational, but hard to live by.\n\nSociety isn't really built to allow many people to have that \"just live\" type of lifestyle.  Unless you have some sort of safety net, you would find yourself struggling pretty hard after trying to just live your life.  Believe me I fully support what you are saying, but I think one thing you have to STRESS is the fact that trying to just \"live your life\" can come with some difficulties and possible failures.  So you have 2 to choose from.  A life where you studied and worked hard, but didn't get much time (if any) to enjoy life OR a life where you pursue what you want to actually live a life, but risk losing things such as possessions and money.  Most require that courage to choose the 2nd option and most feel its just common sense to choose the 1st option.  Nothing is wrong with working and studying and PLANNING to have some fun, but you'd find many lose those plans and the years fly by before they get to do what they want. \n\nIf anyone chooses to follow either of these paths, just expect the unexpected.  I agree that life is short and you owe it to yourself to live a life worth living, but life can carry consequences and you should be willing to at least understand the possible harsh reality that could come from either lifestyle.

"NLY is actually my pick to click in the long run.  They have weathered storms for quite a while and I got in at 10.50.  Don't get me wrong it is a volatile sector right now, with any rumor sending mREITs shooting up or down wildly, so you have to have the tolerance for that kind of risk.  Nevertheless, I think in the long run they, and other mREITs will continue to deleverage and hedge better to deal with the interest rate volatility.  The mREITs that do the best job of this will be the survivors in the long run, and NLY has been a horse for the last 15 years, so that's why I've gone with them."

"It would take too much time to explain why you are wrong.  But you are.  You should go to Kahn academy and take his courses on corporate valuations. "
"well given that revenue isnt really decreasing in the face of intense competition, it means that it is very likely they will be around 5-10 years from now. Their business model has been proven with internet around in full force, and with other retailers like walmart competing. And they didnt really lose any business. They also are operating smaller stores now to deal with possible reversion in revenue. So I doubt they will be wiped off 5 - 10 years from now. But its not a growth story. So hence the 7-9x FCF valuation. \n\nThe market seems to think I am conservative with a FCF multiple of more like 14-15x. It went up 300%, I would have been happy with a 100% gain, and sold it before that."

"I know a fair amount of the backstory behind BB and the last 4 or 5 years of it's life. Little to none of what was posted in the article is news to me. \n\nI don't disagree that blackberry could go under within the next year or two. I wouldn't be surprised. They have had quite a few missteps. The biggest in my mind was holding onto the horrid BBOS for as long as they did. BBOS should have died before 2010 not in 2013. It just doesn't offer enough flexibility. If BB was smart they would have acquired QNX around the time of the iphone release as to have a product ready for launch in 2010.\n\nHowever your attempt to discredit facts as 'opinions' is disheartening considering your in the mobile tech world. I would expect more of you in regards to stuff I stated that is true and not just opinion. Reviewers of hardware need to be impartial and factual not biased and reminiscent of the tech passed. You seem to let the sour taste of the BB of old taint your image of what they are now doing very well. The amount of time BB has had to work with QNX and design a new OS has produced a surprisingly robust result. It doesn't help that many of the retail outlets for mobile tech these days are biased in their offerings due to continued bad press. Biased reviews don't help and many people would love to see blackberry die. Americans just can't help but hate on their northern counterparts and are willing (like in so many other modern day issues) to look past the factual and only digest what is placed in front of them. \n\nAnyways thanks for the civil discussion. I find reddit better for that than forums these days where most people seem to be from within the same camp where it either turns C-J or bashing. \n\n"
"It's hard to describe in text, but I'm going to put focus on what I want rather than what might be the best choice from a financial point of view.\n\nSome examples--\n\nThe house that I bought during my long relationship... I've put a huge amount of my money, time and own labor into it.  It's cheaper to live here vs. rent when you factor the principal pay down, and over the next few years it will start to hit the portion of the rent vs. buy curve where buying is better--but I'm not happy in this town or situation.  So even though it would make the most financial sense to stay in the house for another 3-5 years, I'm going to sell it and move back to the city.  It will be listed by March 1st this year.  My goal is to be living in the city by end of summer this year.\n\nWhile I like the people I work with and the pay is good, I don't find my job fulfilling anymore.  I'm 4 classes away from finishing my comp sci masters at night, I'm going to find a job where I can feel excited about what I'm working on again--even if it means I'm taking a pay cut because I don't have experience.  I'm not sure when this will happen... the financially smart thing to do would be to wait until the house is sold, but I may or may not do that.  At the moment the thing holding me back is that I do like my co-workers and I don't want to leave them in a lurch by going.  We've had a lot of people leaving, including a few just before Christmas, but I'm going to have to bite the bullet sooner than later.\n\nI am also trying to run a half marathon by the time I'm 37... tho I'm only up to about a mile at a time at the moment :-/ ... :-)"

I knew that he would regret, and resent, not trying if I said no.  We, two non-adventurous, likely overly-cautious people, threw caution to the wind and he went for it.  Our counselor at the time thought this a bit out of character for us, until we described our reasoning (long-held desire, last chance, strong ability to succeed in that field, lack of job security in current jobs, greater income, etc).  We put in a lot of thought.\n\nNow?  Pharmacy field is glutted with schools and pay for new pharmacists may be insufficient to repay loans."

"forget about \"investing\".  Learn to SAVE.\n\n1. Your employer likely has a 401k match.  Take it! For the love of all things good, take it!!!  No such thing as a free lunch? This is a free lunch if I ever saw one.  Whatever you need to contribute out of your paycheck to get the maximum match, do it.  For every penny you don't put in you lose another on top of the compounded gains on it for the next 40-50yrs.  The most common match is up to 50% of the first 6% you contribute.  Assuming no raises and you keep this job until you're 62, that's 60k. Both assumptions are 99% sure to not hold up.  You will get a new job and with it, there better be a raise, else you're doing it wrong.\n\n2. Get a regular IRA before a ROTH.  ROTH only makes sense if you expect to be in a HIGHER tax bracket when you will be withdrawing the money.  One of the fastest ways to build wealth, is to keep the government's hands off your money for as long as possible.  at 50k a year you're already in a higher bracket than most retired people. Get it taken out of your paycheck before the taxes hit and the gains on it will be tax free for the next 40-50yrs until you need to take it out. Plus you pay less taxes, since you have less taxable income If you're smart with your savings, and since you're starting with a 50k salary, you should not need to touch that account until you're well into you're 70s.  Open a ROTH AFTER you hit the IRS limit on IRA and 401k contributions.\n\nThese are the best long term tips I can offer.  In the short term, start an \"emergency fund\" or safety net.  This is money you put in a bank or a CD or Municipal Bonds.  Something relatively liquid or easy to access and DON'T TOUCH IT! It goes in there and stays there until you have no other source of cash.  This is effectively a self imposed \"minimum balance\" in your bank account.  A good amount to have is 6-12mos living expenses.  I know you're living at home but do count a decent rent into those expenses, just in case\n\nNext, determine what the next 1-3 BIG purchases are going to be in your life. If I were to guess, I'm going to say, Car, House, GF/Wedding, going back to school, etc.  But it's your life, you decide.  Make an educated guess as to what you think those will cost, and put what you determine is an appropriate amount of your paycheck toward each of those.\n\nFinally, but most importantly, its your money! Save enough so you can deal with most worst case scenarios, (extended unemployment, car accident, major health issue, a parent's death, etc) not trying to be morbid, just you know, worst case scenario, right? after that, do whatever you want! Save it spend it, whatever! "

"You could write some calls in addition to buying puts. Writing calls is essentially saying \"I'm betting the price will *not* rise by more than $X\" whereas buying puts is saying \"I'm betting the price *will* drop by at least $Y\".

"401k should be first place, unless your asset choices are poor.  Second place would be Roth IRA.  Look for no load index matching SP500 fund and an international equivalent for at least half of your investable cash.  Purchase five individual stocks with the rest.  Resist the temptation to trade/churn your individual stocks.  Try to sell gains only in IRA accounts or after a year for long term rate in taxable account.  If you qualify for zero long term rate make sure you wash out long term gains every year up to point where you start paying tax."

"Hijacking top post to add:\n\nMultiples don't take growth into account. OP seems to argue below along the general lines that this is OK because companies very soon end up growing at similar rates regardless. This is not defensible in most cases. E.g. a utility with a market fixed by regulation vs a fast growing innovative company with a good culture. The signal (PE) is overwhelmed by the \"noise\" (different growth rates). For someone who accepts this premise the natural thing would be to compare companies within sectors or industries, which should lead to very broadly similar growth potential and other e.g. regulatory or other governmental influences.\n\nThe E may be particularly low or high in just one year. A solid, even cheap \"value\" stock could well have a \"fair\" PE of 60 if the E in that particular year was unusually low due to an event that is not going to be recurring. And the opposite - e.g. sale of land or something else that has been recognized at cost or written down leading to a large profit outlier.\n\nIf someone is not going to use a DCF model I would advise something like the following - pick an industry, compare similar firms and list out their multiples, then decide to what extent the differences seem justified (usually to quite some extent - the firm with the highest normalized PE will usually be an obvious star compared to the lowest - but the question is how justified).\n\nEdit: re JC Penny, based on a glance it looks like the key issue here is a massive drop in sales over 2013 compared to 2012, 11, 10 etc. a bizarrely large drop even, maybe a spinoff? If that's organic, then I'll point out that the firm made a solid profit in 2010 and 2011, and as a retailer can be expected to be it's leveraged, so that when sales (revenue) falls then costs fall slower than sales due to fixed costs like rent and inflexible staff costs. Over the same last years the price has fallen from a solid 30 to just about 10. IF 2013 is an outlier year and whatever makes people prefer one store over the other swings back in fashion, and the extraordinary expenses aren't recurring, then that would imply a 200% upside. Just if people start shopping there as much as they did 2-3 years back. Still leaves the unusual expenses which likely hide a can of worms, but hey.\n\nOP has however drawn attention to a lot of concepts in a well written post."

Sometimes I feel like I should be out doing normal young person stuff, everybody is telling you that you're only young once and you need to take advantage of it while you can; so I go to a typical party or event, and I sort of have fun with it, but most of the time I just find myself thinking \"why on earth am I putting myself through this\" and wondering why I ever thought it was a good idea.\n\nI feel like everybody is getting this idea of \"living your life in the now\" and \"experiencing your youth while you can\" and going about it completely wrong in a lot of ways, but maybe I'm just the weird one.  People seem to think that living your life means you need to blow all your savings on getting drunk and travelling and doing stuff, and cramming as much action packed typical young person enjoyment into your life as you can while you can, and I guess that is what actually constitutes \"fun\" to some people, so that's ok.  I personally couldn't think of much that is less enjoyable, I'd much rather just take each day as it comes and make the most of it.  I try to enjoy what I'm actually doing with my life rather than trying to go out and fill it up by stringing together a bunch of things that everybody does that being some sort of temporary enjoyment.  I'd rather just make my work moderately enjoyable, and then come home and read a book or something, going out is the last thing on my mind.\n\n\"Living\" means very different things to different people I guess.  Or maybe I'm just a hermit."

"This method is called dollar cost averaging and has been proven over and over to be inferior to lump sum investing. "
"it's going to be hard without having career services of the undergrad business school. I don't know your financial situation, but quite a few schools have 1 year masters of finance programs that are basically an entire 4 years of undergrad finance stuffed into a year. could be worth checking out"
"So wait three years, then buy? "
"Hopefully this is the case. I'll try getting in touch with some people in the business school at my university. Thanks!"

"NLY and AGNC are the staple mREITS to own. Their income is inversely related to interest rates, so with interest rates going up, their income is going down. However they still have a 10+ dividend yield."
"Im not sure, but I think we agree already? The whole point I am making is that you buy at v low multiples that dont make sense. And ignore everything with insane multiples."
"Oh definitely. A new car really doesn't make your life much better. Meeting great people and exploring the world and taking advantage of your health do. But that's just me. "
"\"bad luck\"\n\nA trader admitting his gambling addiction."
"I don't really think that's the point."
"Thanks for the response.\n\nWriting calls seems to be the best option here because I collect the premium which includes the high IV. After the stock price drops and IV drops, I can buy back these calls for pennies.\n\nBuying puts isn't optimal in my situation as I'd pay for the high IV, which makes a large part of options price. "
"Good old Oscar Wilde."
"But what does it matter you? You're dead."
"It sounds like your interests are definitely leaning toward portfolio management and trading. Those two deal way more with the markets than investment banking. So you may want to focus your efforts on learning about trading and management more so than investment banking."
"Most people do have a safety net, it is just an umpleasant one."
"What about the people lives who you impact?"
"Fair enough. I'm a life after death belivin' christian so it seems obvious to me that your actions while alive would affect you after you die. I forget sometimes that some people don't believe the same things.\n"
"That seems a bit stubborn, to blindly follow the same dogma all the time. I want to be more practical, and do what's right for the current environment. "
"Nope. 25%"

"Or just make slight adjustments to it.  Currently I only have Total Stock Market and Total Bond Market funds, and now that it is time to sell some equities, I think perhaps there may be a wiser choice than just moving it to the bond fund.  "
"Are... are you a serial killer?"
"cool story bro"
"Why should 401(k) be first place? Since I don't have matching, that seems to be a poor choice, especially given that I lose flexibility. \n\nAre there some benefits of a 401(k) that I'm missing here?"
"Interesting username, silly sir.\n\nDo you go around fucking people in their orifices while they're asleep? Where can I sign up for that job?"
"I took a bath on AGNC buying at nearly 28 several years ago but those dividends actually made up all my.losses in share price and then some. I love mREITS"
