"I'm more of a *let them walk around on you until hey get bored and fly away* kind of person, but that may be because I'm an entomologist. \n\nSomething people should keep in mind before they try to swat bees and wasps away is that when honey bees and some other bees sting you, the end of their body gets detached along with the stinger, so they die. Even the Hymenoptera that don't die when they sting you are still expending energy to create venom. They aren't \"out to sting you\" if they don't have to. Stinging is a defensive move, so if you act violently toward them, then they'll do the same. \n\nGenerally they are just exploring, looking for food or water sources and might be attracted to you because of your perfume or something. Also, Hymenoptera are an incredible order of insect full of beneficial parasitic and pollinating species, so they might kill something else you don't like. "

"First off, honey bees and bumble bees are incredibly gentle away from their hives and are very unlikely to sting if they just land on you. They're probably attracted to the way you smell--just move away. Blowing gently is okay, too. Freaking out or swatting is only going to make it more likely you get stung. \n\nHoney bees can only sting you once before they die, but their stingers release pheromones that tell other bees to attack you. If you're stung, scrape the stinger/bee away (they're barbed to stay in your skin, pump in venom, and release pheromones) and move quickly but calmly away from the area. \n\nWasps and hornets, on the other hand, can sting multiple times; if they're investigating you, it's probably because you're close to something they want--food or a nest. Observe and move away. Clapping or snapping will sometimes dissuade them. Smoke also discourages bees, wasps, and hornets from getting too close. \n\nIce is the best treatment for these stings (unless you have an allergy and need to seek treatment immediately, in which case, yes, please do that). Bonus: beekeepers such as myself often experience decreasing reactions to bee stings after the first few. "
"Hornets build huge nests in the trees along the paths on my property.  Twice in the last two years, when the leaves fell off in the fall, I've found a basketball sized nest within inches of where I had mowed."
"Also don't kill yellow jackets. They release some chemical that attracts more of them. Source: killed one at my daughter's second birthday. Then two. Then five. Within 30 minutes we had to leave."
"I don't think this is practical for wasps. If you even flinch when they land on you its over. I remember as a kid watching a wasp land on my arm, it was my left arm and I had it out like it would be if I were looking at a watch. Before I had time to do anything that bastard stung me. I got so angry I just hammer fist-ed the spot on my arm where the wasp was. Slowly lifted my hand up to show the crushed wasp on my arm, which was sore as hell at this point. I can't explain why but I picked up the wasp and then football spiked it down to the ground and jumped on it. That'll teach him !\n\nedit a word"

"Only honey bee farms produce honey. Wild honey bees that you find in your back yard are not going to hurt honey production, besides for that single hive wherever it is within a few miles of your home, and even then each hive has thousands of bees (if I recall correctly) that only live for a few months per bee. I am just saying, that is really no reason to not kill a bee. A better reason is that you don't want the guts to spill everywhere, or that you don't feel right killing honey bees."

"As someone who was attacked by a wasp I can say that blowing on it was not an option first of all because it was already determined to attack me.  I apparently unwittingly sat at a picnic table with many people around us  with a nest under it. 30 min into sitting there I look under the table for some reason and I see the nest and they ALL swarmed me. One landed on my face and instantly stung me before I could swat it away (sway away with the skin. not to crush) Didnt leave the stinger in, but that was the day I found out I was highly allergic to wasp stings. \n\n\nSo yes swat wasps away. Don't swat to crush as that will bury the stinger more and get more poison in you, but graze the skin and follow through open air to swat it away and run like hell (especially if they are already in attack mode)"

"When I was about 9, I was swimming in the public pool when a bunch of people began screaming and pointing to my chin. Nestled comfortably within my dimpled chin was nothing less than a mother fuckin wasp. I dunked under water and attempted to hold my breath - thinking this might stop the bug...NOPE. It proceeded to under water sting my face. It wasn't until I breached the surface that I heard someone yell \"blow on it!\" I blew down on it with my upper lip.

"I worked as an archery instructor with little kids who would completely freak out if anything that remotely looked like a bee came near them. Fortunately, I saw a documentary on bees before my first summer, and learned the following...\n\n**If you wave them away very, very, very gently and very, very, very slowly, and you will be perceived as something peacefully blowing in the wind instead of as an attacking giant.** They will still go away, but you will simply not be stung. If they are stubborn and take flight just long enough to land on you again, it's because you are interesting. Basically, they think you're a flower if this is happening (probably because you are wearing some color or have some scent on you). But just keep gently, slowly, gracefully waving them away and they *will* eventually go on their way.\n\nI had to deal with hundreds and hundreds of bees during my time on the archery range, and because I was always quick to tell the kids what to do as soon as they saw the bee, I never had to deal with even a single bee sting. I realize that even with hundreds and hundreds of repetitions, this is still anecdotal evidence. However, my reason for doing it in the first place was based on some scientific findings about bees. I wish I could cite the documentary I saw, but it's been a long time. My hunch is that most documentaries on bees will have something about this because it actually was based on how they identify flowers and foes, which seems pretty basic to understanding bees at all, but I know it's still pretty lame to just tell people to search for it. I just felt that *not* saying anything at all would be the greater crime."

"That is not true\nFirst, remember that credit card companies assess a per-transaction fee each time a merchant processes a card payment. This means that every single meal that you pay for with a credit card accrues card-processing costs the restaurant owner must pay. These costs are usually a small percentage of each transaction. Some owners feel that servers should pay for the cost of processing their tips, and they deduct a certain portion from their servers' tips to pay at least part of these fees. Thus the $7.50 you think you’re tipping your server for good service may actually end up being as much as three percent less than you intended. That may not seem like much to you, but when a server is subject to paying this fee for every credit card tip, it adds up over time."

After spending years bouncing from job to job I wanted a change.\n\nI started back at the local community college this past semester and got all A's (first time!). I too am majoring in political science and have come to find that it's a pretty transferable major. Since it teaches you how to think critically about situations, it works for many careers.\n\nPlease note that my life is quite different. I have two kids, a wife and I work full time. I was still able to do all my school work and succeed. And trust me, I'm no genius. \n\nIf you want something, put the effort in and you won't be sorry. That's what I have learned. I wanted to go back to school and I wanted to do well. I put in the effort and it payed off. \n\nDon't hold yourself back with fear or anxiety. You can do it. It's a very achievable goal, as long as you put the effort in.\n\nAnd like the other commenter said, make small goals. Work on each task individually and set weekly (or even daily) goals. That's how I got through it. \n\nGood luck and happy new year. "

"for me, music is changing my feelings or making me tired / awake... your playlist is good but some tracks sound very sad... almost \"depressing\".\n\nI am a software developer and I work with music all the time. Music is for me like oxygen. \nPersonally I listen to drum and bass, progressive house / tech house to fall into the flow and code like a machine :) The music must have repetetive elements, so I can fall into coding trance (flow). No distracting singing or some crazy sounds. :)\n\nI tried other music genres like classical, hiphop, speedcore death metal... but the techno genre works good for me."

"Barista here! It really doesn't affect the taste. The most important factor for properly steamed milk is the aeration. If the milk is \"screaming\" it isn't going to taste as good and as sweet as properly steamed milk. As long as the barista aerates the milk correctly, kids temperature just makes it not as hot, not any less delicious. \n\nWhat changes the taste negatively is if you order the drink above 170 degrees, which scalds the milk. Eww."
"This is how I always order my drink :)  Triple Venti Salted Caramel latte with soy, 4 splendas, and at a kids temperature"
"Just my take. You are already sick, you already have a runny nose. Your body is on high alert for foreign invaders and actively fighting something off. (In my case it is allergies) I am not a person that believes in antibiotic soaps and hand sanitizers. I will wash after contact with someone who is sick if I am not and after disgusting things, but everyday interactions with germs I don't worry about. I take precautions for my kids to not get what I have but our bodies are made to fight off threats."

"Give him a tip when he is done... Or ask for just his tip. "
"I guess another good thing about this concept is that you suddenly realize how much money is required to hang onto these non-necessities and they don't seem worth it. I haven't missed cable tv AT ALL since I dumped it. This is especially clear if you use a more realistic rate of ROI for your calculation...I personally like the 4% rule, but some might go with 7%....10% is a little pie in the sky IMO."
"If you want to avoid saying \"kid's temp\" for your drink, I would suggest just saying 130 degrees. Baristas usually listen for key words, and tepid is not one of those. They would probably ask you to repeat it for them, then when they actually hear you again, they still might not even know what tepid means. It's really not a commonly used word."

"I wouldn't expect that to work. Typically a toilet handle pulls up on a chain, lifting a flapper and allowing water from the tank to flow down to the bowl. If you rotated a handle the other direction, you would simply be shortening the chain, accomplishing nothing.\n\nUnless there is a more recent technology that I haven't seen in one of my toilets, this isn't the case."

"Generally any instrumental is good music to work to. Video game music isn't made to \"not mess with your concentration\". It's made to match the atmosphere, and it's made to loop well without being too obvious about it. It's there to add atmosphere - so in many ways, it's there to do just the opposite and play with your concentration. If you need to get pumped up, it's there to blast music and pump you up. If it's suspenseful, it'll be music to keep you on the edge of your seat.\n\nAnyway, try different genres of music, see what you like. Try different genres of classical music. Try Jazz. See what works for you. Don't limit your music to just video game music."

"I have a lot of dresses that I hand wash. I just go out the back with a bucket and a hose and gently rub them in detergenty water and then clear water, changing it often. My dresses do require a bit more work though, due to peticoats and the like, but i find that just having a simple system like that works wonders. I use lux flakes that have been pre dissolved in hot water and let cool. Don't use hot water. Cool dry in the shade.\r\rAlso, check if they're dry cleanable. If so, go for that route. Find a reputable cleaners and they will work wonders on your clothes.\r\rIf worse comes to worse, put them inside a doonah cover or pillow case and put them in a cold wash for a short period of time with gentle soap. This would be last resort though."

"As an ex Starbucks barista, I always preferred the sound of 'not so hot', as in 'tall, non fat, not so hot, latte'. Rather than the unpleasant sounding 'tepid' (which I think inaccurate anyway, referring to luke warm which is more like 90 degrees f) or the juvenile sounding 'kids temp'."

"Swirling the cup as the shots are pulling into the syrup helps eliminate this problem. The shots are hot enough to melt it quite a bit, if not completely (depends on if it's a standard drink or if they want fifteen pumps of white mocha). Then, when you pour the milk in, it mixes in more like a normal syrup rather than sitting on top of it and creating the layer of syrup sludge at the bottom. \n\nIt's quite easy to do and the customer still gets a kids temp drink, but without the sludge.
