"This explains a lot. I think I can \"fix\" my sewing machine :) I probably keep wiring it wrong down there "

"It does! And I pad it out where necessary. The boobs aren't really shaped like boobs so I add padded bra cups to even it out. "
"I failed like first 2 or 3 times, before I made something nice. Now I have turned it in to a small business called Chillbe. \nAt the beginning I used second hand materials to figure things out, once I got hang on it I started used high quality materials from specialized sewing shops."

"Aaaaaand you can see the awesome 50's style makeup the Urban Decay rep at Sephora did here: \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/oFACBMa.jpg\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/258HRrq.jpg\n\nI'm seriously in love with how she did my brows. I need to do them like this more often."

"Oh god, is my apartment that recognizable now?! hahaha Thank you!! I'm so in love, I just came back from getting my makeup done and put it on to see the whole effect, and holy crap. \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/oFACBMa.jpg\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/258HRrq.jpg"
"Holy shit it looks so amazing! And so do you!\n\nAnd no, I recognized your work from just the thumbnail....however I might have recognized the apartment when I opened the image if I hadn't already figured it out. I feel like a creeper now."
"very pretty. Love the color."
"stunning"
"You look darling! Such a great color on you, amazing job!"
"*insert wolf whistle here*\n\nYou look **smashing** toots! Have a fantastic night (I'm sure you will)!"
"RADIANT!!! Thanks so much for sharing!"
"I don't know much about sewing machines but I just got a Brother CS6000i for Christmas and it has a drop in bobbin. I'm new to sewing and have been using it the past couple of nights and I really like it. I've done buttons/button holes too. I really like the start/stop button instead of using the foot pedal."
"Wow! The dress is beautiful, and you look amazing in it!"
"That dress looks oh so elegant and lovely! I hope i can eventually make something that beautiful. "
"Gorgeous! You did an amazing job. That color is stunning on you."

"Oh my goodness I can't believe I didn't know about this. I re-made it according to the finished measurements and with a bit of adjusting with darts etc it turned out perfect! Thank you!"
"That would require giving myself plenty of time lol. I must work on that :)"
"There are 3-ply cottons made for mens summer shirtings, often called voile or 'zephyr' for example.  These are high twist causing the yarn to crinkle at a micro level and so leave more space in the weave.  They have a firm hand, and often a glossy finish and can be a bit transparent."
"I  definitely put up some reviews. However once I found the \"finished measurements\" sizing chart and did a few adjustments with darts the pattern worked perfectly."
"Oh my god, its gorgeous. How did you make it? Also, if you ever think of making one to sell, Please message me."
"Snowflake, you rock! and hopefully penultimate can make it better looking than the one the model is wearing, all I see are poorly fitted lines and wrinkling."
"How did you get the waviness on the skirt? Curious if you needed extra material? "
"Those sound like great ideas. Especially the lining thing, I'd never have thought of that. "
"Where do you live? Most large cities like San Francisco have shops where you can rent a machine for an hour at a time, and that would make your life far simpler. Fixing a t-shirt is one of the easiest mods, do a google search and you will find tons of tutorials, with pics or youtube videos. If you dont have access to a machine or club where you can rent one for an hour, find the local college, or check craigslist, or go to a seamstress and have it done. It won't cost much. I would guess with a fitting to ensure proper size and sewing, I could prolly have this done in 10-15 min, so you are looking at a max of $5-15 to get this done professionally, and $5 or less from a friend/self fix."
"I have all of my most used patterns on butcher paper with a was backing, super cheap at any grocery store, and when not is use, I roll them up in the same style as posters, with the label for the pattern to the outside, wrap in rubber band, and keep stored that way. No wrinkles or folds, but I do have to use a weight or pin them down each use so they don't curl back up. Much easier for me, and no need to iron, plus I keep a \"master\" version with all sizes so that in the event I do have to remake a pattern, it is there for use anytime I need it.\n\n-edit [a pic of how I store them](http://i.imgur.com/L2j7odj.jpg) on the bottom shelf underneath my serger cones, still n the process of organizing my battlestation, but gives a good idea!"
"[Have a look at the Rosetti gown site ](http://www.rossetti.vispa.com) - there's a completely gorgeous green wedding gown in the collection but so are her other alternative gowns. She makes wedding gowns as well as couture corsets and ballet/opera costumes that are completely lush. I've been to her workshop and wanted to try on everything! Have a look as she has some great ideas on how to include colours in a traditional gown.\n\nEdit: OP OMG I love that dress! And you look gorgeous in it!"
"I liked this persons recreated set of historically accurate outfits shown here: http://www.tekaengland.com/thesis.html\n\nI like this guys blog, he is following the patterns in a japanese language male outerwear pattern book. I'm working on a coat from the same book and I like his day to day walking through it. Here is a page from the middle of it: http://mainelydadswintercoat.blogspot.com/2011/11/pea-coat-muslin-and-question.html\n\nMale Pattern Boldness has been mentioned.\n\n"
"Beautiful! I need to learn how to sew. :("
"Seconding this. The newer \"Project Runway\" Brother machines have drop in bobbins and are $140ish on Amazon "
"Has anyone found good prices on amy b. Laminated cotton anywhere? Fabric.com is around $15 a yard ugh"
"I do this all the time to make my computer geek boyfriend extremely nervous "
"She is very proficient. Making a corset correctly takes some serious skill "
"I'm fascinated, but also want to come over with plastic bins and a label maker"
"My fav.part...mint green zipper:) "
"I like this. Did you actually redraw the patterns on the butcher paper, or do you just use the butcher paper as a wrapper of sorts for the tissue paper patterns?"
"This makes me want to cry.  Take away 20 stitches and the equivalent brother sewing machine in the UK costs Â£230/$380. You don't even want to *know* how much a quilting sewing machine with more than 40 embroidery stitches costs over here. "
"Don't most sewing machines have drop in bobbins?"
"Holy crap niceeeeee"
"I really appreciate this question and the answers .  I find myself stuck too, and it can be challenging to find inspiration.  These blogs will help me out of any creative rut.  "
"this happened on accident while reaching for fabric with pins in hand, and I must admit that even though I can't really think of anything that could go wrong while doing this. it did still make me a bit nervous\n\n\"won't...won't that break the magnets!?!\""
"You are really talented! This is beautiful! x"
"Modern ones yes, although the one I am giving to my daughter does not. You have to pull the free arm off and then pull the side down and put it in sideways. Within an hour of unboxing I had already worked out how to completely disassemble the bobbin mechanism because it's the only way to get chewed up fabric out. "
"awww thank you so much! I have never received any compliments like this &lt;3\n\nYeah, when I was looking at the dress I thought it was gathered a bit in the first place, which was confusing "
"looks great. adding interfacing would help with adding some layer for protection and also giving it a clean crisp look. "
"Hey, I made one too!  I really like the key ring attachment. "

"The fabric came from Spoonflower, it's called Time Fob &amp; Van Gogh by featheralchemist. Loosely based on the tutorial from Liz at Confessions of a Fabri-holic with my own adjustments and additions. \n\nI'm absolutely in love with it."
"If you have them book marked in your internet browsing program you can probably export them and share them with us that way:)"
"So cute!! Make sure to post the finished product! :)"
"ThankS! I will! I feel like I'll make quite a few of those.. There is no such a thing as 'too many bags', right?"
"As you can see I tried to make a 3DS pouch however it turned out too small because I didn't take into account how thick the layers would be. I tried again with the leftover material and made a perfectly sized one for my 3DS. Now my DS' have matching cases. I initially wanted to add a small pocket for games but I didn't know how to and decided it would take up too much space on the front of the case. "
