"This is a fascinating perspective and I think Kasparov nails it. Regardless of how good a video game may be, it's popularity will lose mass appeal when newer video games are released. Starcraft is a prime example of this. If anyone has played the original game, it took a few years but it was eventually beautifully balanced by blizzard and went on to see years of wide-spread success, most notably in korea. In korea it was actually televised in huge events with large tournaments, sponsored teams, etc. \n\nSo what happens when Starcraft 2 is released? A large chunk of the community immediately migrated to the game and suddenly people who hadn't played Starcraft in years because they follow the latest video game trend were all on the Starcraft 2 boat. This didn't immediately put the nail in the coffin for the already established professional Starcraft leagues in Korea, but it is now less than 5 years later all the major professional leagues for the original Starcraft are closed except one which is dramatically smaller.\n\nWhat is the real kicker in this? Ultimately, it didn't matter how balanced the original Starcraft was, or how high the professionals had taken the level of gameplay for it. What really mattered was that the game was old and everyone was more interested in playing the newest and latest game. Ironically, the original Starcraft, which was arguably balanced perfectly, is replaced by a game which many people consider to not be as balanced at the moment and has years (and a new expansion coming out) before it reaches its end state.\n\nAnd what has happened to many of the Starcraft professionals? Some have managed to make the transition to Starcraft 2, but many have retired or are simply playing other games. This basically means that regardless of one's skill in an older version of a video game, there are / will be fundamental differences when a new version of a video game is released. The eSports community and video game community is basically saying adapt and learn a completely new game, or get out. In a community which constantly forces its players to reinvent themselves on completely new playing fields one could argue that it is essentially cannibalizing a lot of its talent with each game upgrade or switch.\n\nAdditionally, there is something to be said for knowing a game. Sports are simple and once you know the rules you are set and can watch the game wherever you would like. The same could be said for established games like chess and go. Once you know the fundamentals of the game you could follow along and generally get what is happening. Clearly, the same thing could be argued for video games but this immediately becomes a problem when the latest and greatest eSports games keep switching. As time goes on it is likely many people will not be willing to devote time to learning a new game, or simply won't have enough time. Suddenly, switching to the latest video game released excludes these people, at least for a time, because they have to learn the game, if they even care to learn it in the first place.\n\nWhen you start excluding actual fans of competitive eSports based on this principle, how are casual fans who do not follow eSports as much meant to latch onto competitive gaming? Even if a casual fan does become interested in a game, will they still have a passion to learn a new game in 3-5 years when their games isn't the mainstream favourite anymore and professional tournaments for their that game aren't being held anymore. This is certainly hard to say... Of course, an argument could be made that every lost adult fan is replaced by younger individuals who are much more interested in video games in general, but the fact of the matter is eSports is / has more hurdles and complications that current sports / traditional board games.\n\nAlthough I am sure eSports has many things going for it, the industry appears to be on shaky ground at best. It will be interesting to see how things continue to play out!"
"&gt; Quite the opposite - it was to attempt to illustrate how much we have in common currently, particularly with regards to the parade of pied pipers - folks that have swept up the scene with NFL-sized aspirations, only to erase years of progress.\n\nThanks for the awesome response.  But this was exactly my point.  Paulson isn't a pied piper, and noone is following him.  His success or failure need not/will not add to or erase \"years of progress\" or whatever such notion.  Because chess is not in building mode.  Chess is here.  If he succeeds in monetizing something he'll likely benefit himself, and chess fans, and sponsors.  If he doesn't, somebody else will.  It's a non issue.  \n\nThe specific numbers probably aren't an issue, but I think \"quite large\" is not quite doing it justice... it's nearly indisputable that chess is a \"larger\" population.  Also it's nearly completely global - which is quite rare in the world of sport.  \n\nI anticipated I'd start a shitstorm, but not a response from the author - thanks very much!\n"
"I totally get your point, but your point was Kasparov's point.  Chess has staying power - these games come and go.  And there's no guarantee that any individual iteration will be as popular/more popular/less popular or as strategically rich/poor as a previous iteration, or the new generation.  \n\nAlso - while I agree, I tried to make the case that it's not so much about you and I but also about the people who buy ads, who may or may not be \"into\" either chess or eSports.  Which was my final point - I get it, they may not.  \n\nLastly the \"target demo\" argument around a loose collection of sports/games which may or may not last individually is a bit like the x-games, which have seen their popularity wane tremendously in my opinion. \n\nThanks for the good response though! interesting article and discussion."
"This has been attempted before. Max Euwe participated in a correspondence tournament with the stipulation that Black's Q and K were on opposite squares, and castling rules changed to conform.\n\nThe main effect this has is forcing players to abandon all opening theory, but it was also noted that opposite-side castling games were much more common, leading to sharper play."
"I think that Chess is certainly less marketable on as a broadcast sport than \"esports\" (and lets be honest, neither are \"sports\", chess is a strategy game, and \"esports\" are video games). Chess is probably more purely strategic than any video game, and will outlast any given video game. That being said, I think that Chess will remain a fringe thing as far as broadcasting it is concerned, with only the devout chess fanatics actually bothering to watch Chess tournaments, while video game broadcasts will remain popular for the foreseeable future, although any given game (LoL, Starcraft, CoD, Halo, etc.) will disappear in a matter of years. Chess just isn't visually stimulating enough, an entire series of Starcraft can be played in the time it takes to play one match. Even as a fan of chess, I'd rather just look at the matches move by move after they've been played than watch a broadcast of the match itself. The popular video game of the day will always draw bigger crowds than chess, but chess will always exist as it is, and I'm fine with that."

The general aim is to push the king back with your king+queen. To avoid forks, the weaker side will keep his king and rook together as long as possible but eventually you should be able to force them apart. Then, you just need to find a fork."

"The Caro Kann is a reply to nearly all openings white may choose, and in human games, has the highest draw rate.\n\n1. &lt;any&gt;\n\n2. ... c6\n\nIt is a very safe opening and avoids a lot of tactical lines."
"Caro-Kann is solid as shit"
"Interesting how most of these resolutions are expressed as results (I will achieve this rating), while just a few are process-oriented (I will do this behavior).\n\nWe hope that observing a good process will lead to a good result, but we can only control the process, not the result."
"I like being able to use my light-squared bishop. Caro-Kann is pretty good, and you don't really need to know opening lines like you do with the Sicilian."
"So how do you respond to something like the King's gambit?"
"I think that 'see the board from the POV of the side to move' is more a house style than a general rule*, some places show everything from white's POV, which looks more natural to me. An Alekhine book I got shows everything from the side to move in the diagrams, and I have to turn the book upside-down to set the board up.\n\n*Actually, that doesn't really work as well if you're using algebraic notation, so my guess is it depends on how recently you stopped using descriptive notation."
"Yes, but I wouldn't consider it a 'defensive' opening. The most solid defenses against 1.e4 are probably the Caro-Kann (1...c6) or some variations of the 1.e4 e5 openings. The Berllin defence (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6) and the Russian opening (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nf6) are both relatively save."
"1.e4 e5 2.f4 Bc5 is probably the safest way to decline the gambit."
"No. No. No.\n\nNot everyone sees things as clearly as you. Remember, there are people at every level of this game on this sub. Be helpful. What do you gain by being an asshole?\n\nPoint out their mistakes, but do it in a critical manner. Tell them so they improve, not so you feel superior to them. "
"I think the Berlin defense or the Russian opening are safer than the French. The French is not a bad opening, but I think it's more double edged compared to the open games."

"I don't intend to be rude or sound misinformed, but I think the biggest problem is that Chess is incredibly slow paced. Even a casual League fan can enjoy a 30 minute game, whereas a casual chess player can't enjoy 30 minutes of seeing a player concentrate while the commentator runs out of things to say. \n\n\nAlso a casual player really doesn't care if it's a Berlin or a Caro-Kann, these things mean absolutely nothing to him. However, a mage blowing up another mage isn't hard to understand. A sniper hitting a quickshot isn't hard to understand. Two armies clashing isn't hard to understand. \n\nThe only purely strategic game that I can think of that has success on television is Go. China and Korea have TV stations and I'm not sure if Japan has a purely Go related channel, but I know they show Go on television. I think there a couple of differences that make Go successful as a broadcast show. \n\nI'd say the first thing is that the pace is much quicker for the number of moves. A two hour match will have 250+ stones played on a regular basis. They also have all sorts of cool formats, like lightning tournaments(much like chess) but also they have team leagues with a regular season and playoffs and everything.\n\nAnother thing is that draws are very boring to casual spectators. More knowledgeable amateurs can and will get excited for great matches that end in draws, but these knowledgeable amateurs are already watching chess. The \"fresh blood\" that you'd want to bring in to boost the numbers doesn't enjoy draws. Go doesn't have draws. A very tense and exciting match will end by 0.5 points, which is very cool and comparable to a photo finish in a sprint or something. Draws aren't exciting.\n\nLastly, although no one has official statistics for the number of Chess and Go players in the world, it's safe to assume they aren't extremely different. From speaking to Chinese friends however, I think there is a difference in the type of players that make up these statistics. From my experience, a big portion of the 600 million Chess players are people who learned the rules, played a little bit at first but since then rarely, if ever play. However, it seems to me that Go players actually play Go. There are multiple Go academies for children, the Pro scene is much more active, there are many Go salons throughout Japan, China, Korea and Taiwan. Also people play Go in parks.\n\nAnyways, these are just my thoughts and impressions, obviously I have no hard facts and not enough knowledge to appropriately judge this situation."

"Let me add to that: \n\n- concretely, I have some pushes, mostly before tournaments where I do 1-3 hours a day. Apart from that, I try to do at least 0.5 hours every day and ideally 1. This feels right for a dedicated amateur. I try to mix up different types of training/chesstainment to keep it fun.\n\n- don't get hung up on the goals, the training (calculation, patterns, visualization etc. etc.) and becoming a stronger player is the goal, not the rating. \n\nArpad Elo himself with a metaphor of his system: \"the measurement of the position of a cork bobbing up and down on the surface of agitated water with a yard stick tied to a rope and which is swaying in the wind\".\nAside from this, letting your attachment to an increase of rating points reduces a lot of stress and expectations. It paradoxically helps you to do better. \nI can't deny tho, that losing 50 points in a day feels bad. Sometimes when you get a few wrong in a day, it just isn't a good day for you and get back to it another day or after a bit of exercise.  \n\n- do a bit of training, any type of training or even engage in chess entertainment every day (you can). 2200 On CT was a dream when I started, now I am within striking distance! It's, I feel, not at all b/c of any genius on my part, but the ability to work hard consistently."

Whenever I play the king's gambit and someone declines it, I feel pretty confident in the game since my f-pawn gives me more pressure than usual on e5.

"Try chesstempo's endgame puzzles. It's 20/day for the silver $3 per month plan. Or $4 for unlimited. They are really fun. You get a set up, and you get points if you get it perfect and less if you still do well (like mate in 6 when it really could have been done in 4) and slight negative if you really mess up (your move does mate in 10 but you missed the mate in 4) and big negative if you lead to a draw or loss. \n\nI was on the fence about paying, since I am still pretty novice and only have a limited time, but 25 or so tactic puzzles and 25 endgame puzzles throughout the day has been really helpful.\n\nIt's amazing how good a player they make you, bang for the buck. I have only been playing for a few months, and I've jumped from ~700s to around 1500 standard or blitz. When reviewing, I am almost always the first to make an opening mistake, yet I recoup with quick tactical grabs, avoid tactical traps by playing defensively, and when we get to endgames, I almost always win against similar playing levels. \n\nThe other side would have been memorizing openings only to have a novice break them on move 3 and have no idea what to do next (which still happens)"

"Have you play tested this yet?"
"His opponent resigned after making a horrendous blunder (would have lost both his bishop and his rook)."
"Maybe it's that if he takes with the knight(on d4) wanting to take back with the queen he'll run into a discovered attack on his queen with an in between check from the white bishop. Or maybe it's just because he has more defenders after he moves the dark bishop(a move later)."
"Normally in the accelerated dragon black will play Nc6 before Bg7.  an early c3 by white is one of the exceptions..  after c3 you know white is following up d4, so black can play 1. e4 c5 2.Nf3 g6 3.c3 Bg7 4.d4 cxd4 5.cxd4 d5!  And now white has to choose between taking the pawn and having double isolated pawns,  pushing e5 and begin left with a weakened d4 pawn, or playing something goofy that lets black equalize immediately.  That's not the only way to play it, but it's an option."
"Honestly I don't even know why I'm still subscribed to this subreddit, because I'm more into Starcraft now, but I can at least give you my perspective as someone who watches quite often E-sport, in particular Starcraft.\n\n&gt; Lastly, let's also talk about something that advertisers care about: Staying power.\n\nStarcraft is actually over 10 years old if you include the first version, which is said to also be the beginning of e-sports. I would also like to include another number: sustained audience. I don't know about chess, but Starcraft and LoL streamers do daily 5K viewers individually. With famous players all around the world (US, Europe, South Korea), that means there is a respectable amount of viewers 24/7, which makes for a quite interesting number of cumulated view hours outside of any event.\n\n&gt; Lastly, let's also talk about something that advertisers care about: Staying power. Chess will survive paulson, or chess.com. StarCraft and League of Legends may, or may not.\n\nThat's a strength and a weakness. If you look closely a significant factor that keeps players and viewers in the game is that both Starcraft and LoL can renew themselves by changing - even slightly - the rules and/or some game elements. This is particularly obvious for LoL, which as over 100 characters each with a unique gameplay. At some point, they used to introduce one new character every couple of months, or \"rework\" some character that was not played because obviously weaker than others. Starcraft is a lot more stable, but every season (about 3 months iirc), they change the \"map pool\" for ladder games. Of course, current video games will fade out (only to be replaced by newer video games), and none of them will ever rival the longevity of Chess.\n\nHowever, it's not all that important for advertisers, because advertising is opportunistic by nature. Times change, people change, games change, products change. What is important to them is to reach as much potential customers as possible. E-sports allows that in two ways: first, in order to reach the E-sports status, a video game must already have a significant player base that might be interested in events and streams. It doesn't matter how long it takes, it just has to happen and live long enough. Second, the E-sport audience is, or guess so, more easily defined than the Chess audience. When you advertise in a big Starcraft event, you know you'll mainly talk to teens/twenteens males that play video games. I don't think the Chess audience can be as narrowly defined.\n\n&gt; Who is a more marketable personality, Carlsen or Emmanuel \"Grubby\" Schenkhuizen? Obviously Carlsen\n\nNot so obvious to me. Remember that Grubby is an independent pro player. He was able to get sponsors all by himself, although he was and still is quite young. And that's even still true for more controversial players like \"Idra\" or \"Destiny\", both of them being very well known for their bad manners. Even Korean players that barely speak English can switch on their stream and get 5K-10K viewers worldwide without telling anyone, if they performed well in a previous tournament. Plus, one may talk to them directly when they are streaming; having a chat box is the norm on streaming sites. Is that the case for the majority of top chess players (genuine question)?\n\n&gt; I don't mean that the same qualities used in StarCraft aren't useful in chess and vice versa - a lot of the discussion on this sub has made me want to get more involved in eSports because I think the skillset IS so similar\n\nNot at all in my opinion. Starcraft is A Real Time Startegy game, an RTS. Some say it is actually more of a tactical game though. The fog of war requires to play very often with only partial information about what the opponent is doing. Finding ways to acquire this information despite the countermeasures of the opponent is crucial. Mind games, the art of making the opponent believe you are preparing a certain kind of attack, also plays a major role.\nFigures show that pro players do at the very minimum two actions per second on average in a game that lasts 30 minutes typically. They have to think less deeply about what to do, but they have to think fast and execute fast. Starcraft is also a game of mouse accuracy. Furthermore high level players are admired for their multitasking, their ability to manage multiple fronts at the same time.\nThe real time aspect is a core element of the game. You can play Chess by email, but you absolutely can't with Starcraft.\n\n&gt; I really like gaming, gamers, etc. but I wish they would stop acting like they're pioneering everything. They didn't invent broadcasting, real sports did.\n\nPerhaps, but you have to remember the context. A decade or two ago, video games were considered an activity for kids or teens. Nowadays it is a huge industry that rivals Hollywood with adult customers (even my mother who plays Farmville is one of them, in a way).\n\n&gt; They didn't invent games, games have always existed.\n\nVideo games are not just games, that's a huge misconception. Most of them mix elements from the seven arts and elements of traditional games, but the result is much larger than the sum of these parts. Video games actually re-invented games.\n\n&gt; They're trying to turn a hobby into a professional sport\n\nThey are not trying, **they already did!**. According to [this random source](http://chess.geniusprophecy.com/professional-chess.html), about 100 Chess players are able to make a leaving of it. At least [50 pro starcraft players](http://www.sc2earnings.com/) make a quite decent income. And that's just Starcraft, which is now the second game in E-sports. Figures over a whole carrier may tell a different story, but still.\n"

"Maybe it's not as defensive as the Caro-Kann.. but it's definitely can be played in a defensive manner. After-all, it's called the Sicilian DEFENSE."
"i strongly recommend you checking out MatoJelic. He is a chess lecturer rated 2000+ who shows instructive videos of historic games.\n\nIt is really entertaining, very informative, and most of his videos are quite short. Make sure you check him out, its a lot of fun and quite funny sometimes.\n\nJust type the name on the search bar and click on his channel."
"I guess people boosting their ratings."

The last variation is most interesting.)\n\nor ...\n23. ...  Rc5\n24. Be7 Rd5\n25. Ne3+ Ke6\n26. Nxd5 Qxd5\n27. Rae1 and white is much better."
"I ran the game through Stockfish. There was a point when you only had  seven the pawns and the two bishops and kings on the board and were 1.5 points up. I let stockfish play both sides from that position for a while. 70 moves later, Stockfish is just repeating moves so I decided that it was a draw."
"Thanks very much, I think you've made a good point about not being in a rush. I think I will definitely keep my eye on a set with the hope that they offer a sale at some point.\n\nThey did offer a 3 for 2 deal at one point but as I'm only looking for a set and board the offer didn't 'offer' me anything."
"Thanks very much for your reply.\n\nI will have a look on Ebay to see whether they have anything like you mentioned. \n\nIt's a shame what happend to your set :("
"Huh?"
"Mato has a video greatest player vs greatest attacker out it's a pretty good video and his voice when he comments is incredible.\n"
